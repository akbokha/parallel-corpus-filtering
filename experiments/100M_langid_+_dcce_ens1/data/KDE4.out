&quot; to translate the module web page in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras web page , select the output and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part of the entire &amp; URL will be translated . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; only web pages on the internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them lighter available . &quot;
further information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual too &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings . open the tab card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Tools cr@@ ashes . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if present . &quot;
the module view filter ( also called Ord@@ inary filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras pane filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different types .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a default the ad starts with the root node of the document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ str@@ ates of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to visu@@ alize ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . tree @-@ maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color alignment and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched via View Color Mode , can either display depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or mapping of any other file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles should be used ( hence representation errors can be set by restrictions on the sign of Tre@@ e@@ Map ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of display algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always maintained . &quot;
&quot; how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is possible for the lab@@ eling and avoiding space losses through frames always advan@@ tage@@ ous to divide the rect@@ angles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the View View menu item . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools View picture gallery ... or with Ctr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
the option images per line has a slider and a rot@@ ational field to adjust the number of mini@@ atures of each row in the gallery .
&quot; with the check box name of the image , specify whether the file names under the thumb@@ nails will be shown in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box file size of the picture , specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the thumb@@ nail image size , specify whether the size of the images is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the check box Sub@@ folder , you can set with a slider or a rotation panel , up to which level the sub @-@ folder will be included . &quot;
copy the original images to the check@@ box and specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
&quot; using the commentary box , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tioning the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the Custom color depth check box , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the navigation pane , or with the key short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation pane , and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback . &quot;
change browser ID adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; add to which you can change the browser and operating system identification for individual domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with specific browsers .
&quot; the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that deny access to this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SIE for pages that deny access by browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SIE browsers detection to access Hot@@ mail with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to W3@@ C standard or use the own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
this option is used to use the default browser detection for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry Insert ... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in detail .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ Style Templates and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with W3@@ C recommendations and other standards .
check the module web page in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under Tools website . you can check the following ex@@ ams :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; check if your &amp; HTML ; document the syntax of &amp; HTML ; con@@ forms to all errors found . with this test , you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly from all browsers . &quot;
&quot; allows you to check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ Style Templates , embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS , your web pages have a uniform look regardless of the browser used . &quot;
check the links on your page on forwar@@ ding instructions and incorrect connections . recur@@ sively all links on the website are reviewed .
here you can specify the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; -@@ Sty@@ les .
with the module Web @-@ Archi@@ ving for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can save web pages with text and images in .@@ war format .
&quot; with the mouse click on the Tools page , and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page . &quot;

&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera , and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ code ; - albums can be downloaded . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ os ; together . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , review and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; the camera or lens to be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs also come &amp; digi@@ os ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; it is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you &apos;re a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ous , then we would like to encourage you to answer other users &quot; users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ cone ; home page to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous ; to learn .
the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for regi@@ stering in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; for the first time , you will be asked where to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote , or remote folder . simply enter your path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; it will also be used as an al@@ b library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; viewed every sub @-@ folder as an album . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; dur@@ seek recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian in its full depth . you cannot close any sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folders . you can do this by adding a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list have no photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can enter &amp; digi@@ code ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Til@@ es to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw Cam@@ eras in the Help of Roh@@ kam@@ era@@ support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ setting and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; a simple to use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera , and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ code ; - albums can be downloaded . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ os ; together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras that supported an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communic@@ ating with your computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers across the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to be able to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . Exif support is provided by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to come about &amp; digi@@ tization ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
&quot; ki@@ pi modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the ki@@ pi modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the old tree , using the horizontal divi@@ ding line or another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to get the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields indicated in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this ind icon is shown . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the setting settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , according to their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the destination album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . in order to access the album properties , click on the album with the right mouse button and select the album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete items by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
&quot; the older , average , new test@@ ers : these set the date on the date of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . to this , the average of images from their EX@@ IF information is attempted . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first started an album in &amp; digi@@ os ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &quot; &quot; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first picture in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another picture as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included only in a collection and collections cannot be wa@@ sted .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ word@@ list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these thumb@@ nails with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . which information is , you can change about settings digi@@ comes ; set up . select here the Albums tab and customize the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails have help windows , which appear . if you leave the mouse po@@ inter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen shot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such help window . &quot;
photos and keywords will allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as it suits you . image Edi@@ ting shows your photos and allows you to create a number of improvements to them . you can select all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ You have the choice between viewing the pictures and a slide show or editing the pictures .
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the digi@@ code section , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of Open with . to do so , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing by other image processing programs you may have problems with the metadata contained in the picture . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ comes ; provides two ways to rotate . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you have the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you got a photo from &amp; digi@@ ces ; delete it , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin von &amp; k@@ de ; post@@ pon@@ ed . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete if you prefer to really er@@ ase , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ al@@ sli@@ st@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all pictures of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the data view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . in this way , you can log@@ ically organize your words . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ list , so that you can easily find the tags you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word &apos; or on an existing keyword , and then choose New keyword . if you click a new keyword after you click on an existing keyword , this keyword will be added to this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be a time in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the keyword menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another picture as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you select the photos you want to have with a keyword , you can click on the respective keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; pull and place it . alternatively , you can click on the respective keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; pull and place them . alternatively , you can also click on the thumb@@ nail of the pictures and select from the keyword menu . &quot;
&quot; you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can enter a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have signed a photo with keywords , this will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the keywords menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . thus , all the corresponding images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this appears in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future . &quot;
&quot; next to the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when searching matches . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always fil@@ tered what you have entered as a search crit@@ erion . after you save it , it appears filter in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , press the OK button and the search will be performed . the search function will be displayed in the View list view list . if you want to change your selection according to the search list , select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in his context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select an advanced search , the dialog for Advanced Search will appear . you will find more information in the Advanced Search section . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu Search . &quot;
&quot; advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list using the search group / search group . any option can be added to other via logical operations All ... , One ... , None ... or At least ... can be used for searching for type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; it allows images to compare by compar@@ ing these sign@@ atures . the smaller the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a swing , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; find the right pictures .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the marble mini utility . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this assumes that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
in the field below you can specify a name for your Geo Filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&quot; it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em C@@ lamp from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated console and open its window .
&quot; from the thumb@@ nail you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area can be seen . if you preview preview synchron@@ ize from the tool bar and execute Zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of both pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you use pairs of pairs from the toolbar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ ing compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ der actions work directly from the brightness like e.g. F@@ 4 File Edit .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the brightness table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swing the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
zoom the zoom slider under the images or Ctr@@ l ; Mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are pre@@ viewing in the preview mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the modem &apos;s word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can back up your pictures , protect , protect and use photos again . we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , group@@ ing , storing , evalu@@ ating , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and expor@@ ting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management occup@@ ies , index@@ ed , categ@@ or@@ ised , ass@@ ures , searching , transformed , assembled and exports content which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is provided according to your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ ous ; . the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving which you can freely access to other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were organized several times in the same place . the remaining photos will be organized by your date . if you do enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folder such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option metadata to be saved in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ .@@ This ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item from the album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts since you need to assign keywords , cap@@ tions and valuation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or continue Categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import catalog@@ u@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically put the tree for you or insert the pictures to the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very coar@@ se representation since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool for catalog@@ ing your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you just want to let anybody know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , fol@@ ks , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start to dream to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motive that moves you to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ cone ; you can save any amount of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of goog@@ le@@ earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation now continues with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; you can also export the images to G@@ allery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ckr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information came about at &amp; digi@@ tization page ; as information should be stored :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to save the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this may be as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you see the image other . if the image is a bearing photo , then here the group / agency that offers the image is provided here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : record error , record failure , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be cau@@ tious and you may not dare longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 a piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recor@@ ders and store them in the right way . the best DVD recor@@ ders are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . this is why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently performs miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
visual media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said on CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disk@@ makers retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ co@@ er@@ ability study &quot;
&quot; the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , SMAR@@ T can not detect these errors . some of SMAR@@ T fail to determine the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are in particular Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publisher counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; these can cause serious damage on your computer . this can cause serious damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause locked ke@@ yp@@ ads , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that results in loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against current tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy j@@ okes and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against lightning strike , protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and keep the system down . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they are fulfilling the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security for power dis@@ rup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . using the right configuration , you can mount it as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are priced at home compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are stored on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more , in case of Fli@@ ckr you will have unlimited storage , which should only be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission mistake occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ bances remain un@@ discovered until you have been able to open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL compliant license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . please read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts amounts to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a less@@ er damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ fs , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the widespread file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
even DSLR cameras have your fron@@ tier at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your fron@@ tier at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard disk now for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else liable for data loss . thus , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , lightning struck you might be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ Prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , to the neighbor house , to your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for loss of data in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two points : the complete backup and the final differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup .
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that have been really changed . this is done compressed and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h . &quot;
back up important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; this approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting pictures and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is about the span in which you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be noted : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to be treated as the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have the scal@@ ability with incorporated and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new record :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG may store g@@ amma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assign@@ ments for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the dis@@ advantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression . &quot;
TIFF was widely used as picture format . TIFF can store images in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorith@@ m ( DE@@ FL@@ ATE ) .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open shell format developed by Adobe Systems . it is developed on the TIFF / EP Format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP will fit as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards , which support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modelling , discussions and community work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , card reader or scanner . as long as images are on your camera , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it to your archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine processing you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ code ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were then cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous ; to get . in the section Add a Photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , connect them to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file assignment are shown for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the page features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not provide all information .
&quot; the metadata field metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer recognition , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button to download and then select all pictures from their camera . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the chosen ones . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not yet been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ os ; downloaded . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All you want to download or download the chosen ones , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums is shown on the My Albums tab . select the destination album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ met ; downloads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must select them first and then delete Sel@@ ected Del@@ ete ones . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera ; you should check carefully if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera crew completely , you should do so via the camera service , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos are deleted from the camera . this may be a double file name if you load photos of different recording sets in the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the information about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ zation . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use another date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case when downloading it . or in Up@@ per@@ cases if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new filename , which came &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used for a photo , will be shown below the name that the camera will be pre@@ viewing . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cone ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic turn during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Maps metadata you can read more details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it &apos;s digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , &amp; digi@@ came ; this sub@@ albums are based on image data . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ os ; the photos are directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ column option at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be indicated in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to mapping an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later for@@ got where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle , and map reference . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated GPS unit , but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you have to store these data in g@@ px format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and long@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show a European road map . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages , and you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot;
select action can be displayed on net preview or start image editing . you set the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera list . even when using database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for author line : this field should include the photographer &apos;s job title . these can be names such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo of the photo . this must not be the author , if this is a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be listed here as this is the image other &amp; quot ; offer@@ en@@ quot ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this will enable the metadata to be permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; . these metadata also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous .
&quot; save image labels as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this syn@@ cs the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse po@@ inter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ os came to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ous of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you then open the illuminated button these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this View mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation .
&quot; with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorith@@ m . &quot;
&quot; with the TIFF file , you can comp@@ ress the DE@@ FL@@ ATE compression algorith@@ m for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the lossy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ os , image editing was only one image viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings . &quot;
&quot; the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels on odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . default is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your pictures which are burned , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to look at the pointed white in the settings . the setting colors trig@@ gers some unusual results , as it displays the top lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ filled blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to re@@ construct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; place the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conservative . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design . &quot;
&quot; as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) , it looks like an A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m used by D@@ cra@@ v . cheap is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color soft@@ ening correction , since you are performed during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile translat@@ es the color information and gives instructions how to return it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information how to translate color information from a colour space to the other are to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; choose the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c , or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to perform the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are more options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your picture would be given by a device again . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller color space as your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obviously what color profile is provided for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon Profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the ki@@ pi interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the ki@@ pi modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ ous ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings menu .
more information ( in English ) about ki@@ pi modules can be obtained via the ki@@ pi project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the ki@@ pi modules .
&quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adju@@ sts the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show a list of all supported cameras on the left hand side . on the right there is a button Automatic detection , which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them into display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the camera from the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog box for moving pictures into the tr@@ ash bin , you can display the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um of &amp; digi@@ os ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; applied if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ os ; disable at boot . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m start searching for new photos forced &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ os ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be found in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ come ; to create , find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the item View / Edit .
&quot; image Edi@@ ting contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the ki@@ pi modules , see section Image Processing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the filename , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save the Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
you should also copy a copy of your image before changing it . you can save it with file save as .
&quot; as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File menu or use the button The button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time saving . &quot;
almost any image editing action can be und@@ o or restored . the last action can be und@@ o by selecting Edit Re@@ vert or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should refer to the keyboard short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z to und@@ o , and re@@ mark Ctr@@ l ; Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the back@@ end or restore button in the toolbar at a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be und@@ o und@@ o or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image up , picture , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can zoom in the picture and zoom out in which you use Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the menu menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change this in the settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ ous ; change . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . entire image templates can be printed out of your choice . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select print wiz@@ ard from the album . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation files , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut after 2000 characters and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the button App@@ ly or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata to the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
the evaluation section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ ding . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the rating of the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the schema in the following table :
&quot; the stit@@ ch view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword @-@ word @-@ tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ x . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of pictures . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if you select several images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - data , stit@@ ch and search views is used . if additionally one or more keyword filter is used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all the keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it to the selection . a dialog box asks you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window displays the images on a calendar tag . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings other .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an advanced search through all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ ad@@ ministered workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner will have a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color@@ ad@@ ministered workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those from your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with more information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow fulfil@@ s all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color administration . &quot;
they work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image outputs are via email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you then use another colour space and thus have to worry about color administration ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excell@@ ente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB is leaving the circle . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic synchron@@ ization and contrast expand from the menu correc@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically to make the most of your colors the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ osity values across the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; in this way , nearly every brightness range achiev@@ es very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces a very powerful operation which causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic synchron@@ ization : this method maxim@@ izes the range of colours in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a re @-@ ji@@ aded of all values in between . this is only visible in full @-@ washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ lev@@ elling correction is a bit limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorith@@ m protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Color White balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and the preview of the tool can be viewed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original copy right again , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynam@@ ically changes once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
save as and load exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance that you have set you can save to a text file and load it later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences tab returns all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , processing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw pictures . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color tone mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use it for more photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the correction correction you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ cone ; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects , a solar vibration effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar pol@@ ari@@ zation was also called sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect was created by placing a partially developed pressure from the additional light . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive photo paper by the additional light . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar pol@@ ari@@ zation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via features very saturated color in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the Ne@@ on@@ Filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the valve re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can view the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be seen in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool plays sound correction for the improvement of exposure . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the kno@@ b and take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right hand side you can view the original and preview the image . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic layout is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ p@@ ens can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in the input values . for example , compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the for@@ eg@@ round . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . for this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a picture . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere Canal : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded using a digital camera , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve part to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over @-@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result . &quot;
down@@ wards you can see a black and white photo fixed in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change colour shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Canal Mixer of image processing .
with the Channel selection box you can select the color for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as comparison to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are on the right : kno@@ bs for red , green and construction permit you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you are using the corresponding mon@@ ochro@@ me as the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color to a visible noise origin@@ ates from the colour space . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was newly adjusted . the option l@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography Black / White is a work step because color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ en@@ profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . so similar to the 002 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 003 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) red filter . &quot;
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural dy@@ e correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold into the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of having a pressure and recovery in a sep@@ i@@ metric . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cone ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cone ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
&quot; the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , be@@ v@@ elled around it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width ranges from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially when you cut the tool to aspect ratio previously . &quot;
&quot; using this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image at any location . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the digi@@ cone ; tool template , you can put a template on a picture . &quot;
the Image Template menu apply in image processing can be used to lay templates on a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to shr@@ ink the size file size . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ ous ; sten@@ cil database , just send an e @-@ mail in English to &amp; digi@@ ous ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be marked for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for st@@ encils , a tree view is displayed that reflects the folder structure of the Stencil folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the templates of templates . &quot;
below the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button decre@@ ases the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ cone ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it &apos;s very fast and easy , but it produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorith@@ m was removed from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photographs without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alization process of colors with minimal differences must be summari@@ zed . thus , the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner addresses a focal depth already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you get the control over your image . &quot;
in some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing ke@@ ener . you can call it with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ating sharpen@@ ing .
&quot; however , you should be careful because the results are not very natural : sharpen@@ ing increases shar@@ p@@ ness of edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , you can re@@ focus the tool to shar@@ pen an image . you can re@@ focus on the menu entry . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for soft@@ ening with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate plas@@ tici@@ zing and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius represents one how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image which is added to the original . thus the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference to be applied to a edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpen@@ ing and therefore avoid beauty mistakes in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted un@@ folding filter algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration .
&quot; in practice , the circular fis@@ sion works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel that is far from the original source pixel . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels . the causes undes@@ irable results . &quot;
&quot; this is the radius of the circular fold . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ness effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , the filter can accept values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; pal@@ ate &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos; s shar@@ p@@ ness . use this parameter when your shar@@ p@@ ness is pal@@ ate . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase cor@@ relation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the pal@@ ate &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to do all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave un@@ comfortable art@@ ef@@ acts later . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results as sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king use a larger neighborhood as sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter you can show that it is the optimum linear filter . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp picture image must be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of field correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regulator smooth@@ es the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area of the dark@@ ened area , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the colour tin@@ cture allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the in@@ aug@@ ural algorith@@ m was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . &quot;
&quot; orientation Dep@@ th alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es uni@@ form@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gr@@ itt or CCD @-@ noise , a high value will create wa@@ vy pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorith@@ m is going through . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step@@ width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the increase in quality that you receive by choosing this option is only minor . however , it dou@@ bles the running time . we recommend it to leave it . &quot;
save as and load exactly this . any setting of picture errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; errors can be corrected compar@@ atively very fast in the work . however , it can take very long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel . &quot;
below you can see how image errors were removed with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined sound that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; the radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing at the front of the filter to determine the brightness changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls edge accuracy for the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise cannot be removed or cra@@ cks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
brightness : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process which controls the details -@@ settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma toler@@ ances of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more strongly smo@@ ked , but also destro@@ ys the shadow areas too . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of phase absorption . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove smo@@ kes and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
store under and Load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is lab@@ eled with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ pen . use this tool for soft@@ ening with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate plas@@ tici@@ zing and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cone ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film b@@ askets , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ zed images . &quot;
the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; reduce JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a lossy compression algorith@@ m , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
save as and load exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera is recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ ori@@ ous film gra@@ ining on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; at the bottom , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p , using algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode shots because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark picture button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to directly record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark picture to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard notes the last dark picture and automatically re@@ charges it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all thumb@@ nails .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : an average of the neighbour pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square ben@@ ds ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixels correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ ungs@@ correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by placing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective conditions also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 when it comes to the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or grey stage depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation to a picture . the tool vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of absorption of light at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density in order to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of exposure to the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ card ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ et@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; len@@ tic@@ ular distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second grade deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but flat@@ tens on edges . this correction is not applied to the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , each geometric distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the thickness of distortion of the second degree . negative values can be corrected , and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tions fourth density . this value affects the edges rather than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter in general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus performs a correction first gra@@ ding .
light values adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview preview the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values for the next start . &quot;
the pitch or cushion correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . the best result is this correction first of all . if you re@@ vise a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction the effect would appear to be the wrong one .
&quot; to help you find the best correction you can find this tool a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the note / kis@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black ver@@ tices . you can remove it with the cutting tool in the menu trans@@ forming random cutting out of image editing or via the zoom slider of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , e.g. shots from the front , frame and painting , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorith@@ m is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infrar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two parameters of film and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add movie gra@@ ining if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gra@@ ining and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter cartridges are mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; it is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix big silver particles of the emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the viewing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film conversion effect on a black / white image applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cone ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cone ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . flat@@ ten the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the handle is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ s 17 .
&quot; it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoothing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; Filter Grav@@ ur marks your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom in shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point of view . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in the field of sports photography .
radi@@ al shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by turning the pixels at a central point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
dist@@ en@@ sion : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ foc@@ uss@@ ed camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ red : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographer , camera . &quot;
&quot; this produces photos with a dre@@ aming and glossy soft Fok@@ us@@ effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ maus : wi@@ pes the picture by acci@@ dental shi@@ fts of the pixels and simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the color sink in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
&quot; some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation anytime with the button Finish . &quot;
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorith@@ m .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
&quot; you can select with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing a range free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ pfen Filters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning in the right direction . &quot;
photo bu@@ bb@@ les is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you bu@@ bb@@ les a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m that is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the size you want with the tool size . &quot;
&quot; changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , try the tool to bu@@ bb@@ les . &quot;
the underlying algorith@@ m photo bu@@ bb@@ les was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot;
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly to it . each image can be magni@@ fied as text file and then re@@ charged .
&quot; photo bu@@ bb@@ les is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long time and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bu@@ bb@@ les by enlar@@ ging a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged photo ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to create an image . the image editing allows you to simply cut the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , create . you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse . &quot;
you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cut button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file save or file saving under the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by drag@@ ging the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool to cut to aspect ratio , you can indicate the orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format . &quot;
&quot; cut the tool to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog box , there are two buttons to set the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can use the Max ratio button to cut the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the altered frame dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the assembly help make it possible to blend with aids , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden mean : the golden middle is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the blades of flowers of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you have been using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your tem@@ ples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden middle provides more liquid help lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition takes the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river on this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also der@@ ive from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the center points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not an equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be seen a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise . &quot;
mir@@ r@@ oring options horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divi@@ des .
with the button Colour you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera out ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees again . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right top .
&quot; for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function trans@@ forming Zu@@ trimm@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to trim the image is the function Automati@@ cally cut . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you missed the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming cro@@ pping out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the sh@@ ading tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . &quot;
&quot; create your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sh@@ ears horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ading tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped a little . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ ear@@ ings generating twice as much bl@@ ur@@ p and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular perfor@@ ations in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming cro@@ pping out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; it requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ ili@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependen@@ cy on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; this is done by file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file extensions that came and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can modify this list of file extensions that have come and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you can find more information in the configuration section . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw image format , you can read some helpful hints in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which was included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ All support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ os ; supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these formats are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format , but it &apos;s not a film editor and therefore does not have a film editing program and therefore does not have built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the movies use to start playback of movies to start playback . &quot;

many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; included . your description will follow here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ en@@ ers , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of it , five buttons allow the comparison mode of the preview area to change . these modes are : &quot;
ver@@ tically divided without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
&quot; ver@@ tically , the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
the upper area shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse in the image and place on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data origin@@ ate from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the marble mini utility . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press Ctr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this assumes that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the p@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and user used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or search the folders to files . &quot;
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . afterwards , move the mouse at pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is enabled C@@ ursor under the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows . if so , if three numbers are stored in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&quot; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally , -@@ project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program . &quot;
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in the graph is in &amp; kate ; the graph@@ s are re @-@ calculated and presented in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; open or graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; in one &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems of approximately 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to show more than these k@@ not )
&quot; further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s requires : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; key ) ; &quot;
zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will also be done . if you want to change your decision later , you can configure the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ cally ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or display the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it afterwards with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; during program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later change . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely selected .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page can be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Recovery page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or consult the program each time . &quot;
open the page opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; specify when a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or are asked to be asked for each start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graphical ; layout algorithms . entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
the algorith@@ m puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ l@@ aps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ read graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorith@@ m is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; fd@@ p ; algorith@@ m creates a spr@@ ing@@ spr@@ ing@@ model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid remote trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ ster@@ ous graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ Algorith@@ m arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as parameters , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the graph@@ s with a filter before drawing . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ executed ) and applies the default algorith@@ m for the respective type ( dot ; for forward @-@ looking graph@@ s ) .
&quot; if this setting is checked , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;

the ki@@ pi module reading images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner that supports the S@@ ane project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default duc@@ r@@ oth standard to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before clicking on the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be shown to you in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure the window will be displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . please remember that the type BMP does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image . &quot;
screen shots can be generated after you have selected impor@@ ting and screen@@ shot in the menu . a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , just read the window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box dialog appears with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed in front of upload in size . size is taken from the value registered with Maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the ki@@ pi Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your Picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the ki@@ pi Module Gallery Export does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the ki@@ pi team mailing list below k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the ki@@ pi module for geographical loc@@ alization uses tools to locate images geographical in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width of latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Lok@@ alization cor@@ relation . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and retri@@ eve the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file .
if the file loads an automatic cor@@ relation which displays the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time here .
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and the camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is summari@@ zed . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one location for images you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog itself coordinates the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set by the shown map . select the region and enlarge it . always select the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually between the map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the ki@@ pi module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the ki@@ pi Module Photo Gallery is a tool for expor@@ ting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed &quot;
the Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all the corresponding images . select a folder where you want to write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album rider for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are shown in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program settings to determine if errors occur during creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press close to close the module . &quot;
the ki@@ pi image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the ki@@ pi image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a wind@@ owed mode . &quot;
the ki@@ pi JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to store images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no comp@@ ress of color information takes place . for example , this can be found in PNG format . &quot;
the ki@@ pi Module Digital Camera Client is a tool so you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the ki@@ pi Module digital camera client has not yet documented documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the ki@@ pi team mailing list below k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ki@@ pi module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the ki@@ pi team .
&quot; with the import function of metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work in all picture formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any destination format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the ki@@ pi MPEG Enco@@ der Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that you can create the module via Tools MPEG slide show .
the pictures you selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you &apos;re happy with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under Name of the MPEG output file . keep the same mp@@ g as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button code . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages using the button settings right below . &quot;
the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print it with the Gim@@ p module for a direct print@@ out .
&quot; with this ki@@ pi module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes , you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will appear in mode for a single image . with the preview preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion output . the filename is the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a lossy algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently or later , you should not select the JPEG format because there are only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in a format format , the metadata included in the raw file are saved in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt , but a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion progress has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
proportional ( 1 Dim . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 Dim . ) : res@@ ize in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to the screen format .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : non @-@ proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepare the image for the photographic print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this ki@@ pi module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent earlier .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images you select . using the button Add Images you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them in order to add the list of the images to be sent .
&quot; with the button , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures , you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are already attached as attachment . &quot;
don &apos;t be sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
&quot; choose your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format from the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the sending pictures . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the closing button , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears asking questions about how to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation enables very elegant graphical transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the filename option will show that the filename of the images in the lower left corner will appear during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually start with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option pictures random@@ ly select to show that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; between the images , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect in each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename , the position of the current image and the whole number of images in your presentation . &quot;

&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following each section is described more accurately . &quot;
first enter the title of the survi@@ vor and a description containing the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings .
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . see more information about export files in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information showing the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are displayed by a party . note that all images are exported by a party . therefore , you can not use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically discussed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . therefore , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images that , for example , have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , it can search your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission period . if it wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL that you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . thus , the import function , look correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting at the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time for viewing the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even do once . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a two @-@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you created when creating the HTML files are searched . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting images is described , which you can access via the File Export ... menu . &quot;
&quot; the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , and the following three choices are available : &quot;
&quot; on the Manual button near the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy the option Automati@@ cally to the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images are automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu item ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then in which folder the import pictures should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the file to be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can synchron@@ ize the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it just has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps of ( 1 ) Setting up the information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the index@@ .@@ xml file in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal Backup Tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in C@@ VS . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another database tree with pictures , you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index@@ .@@ xml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu item settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can move to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings are explained . &quot;
&quot; on the left , you can see six different symbols with which you can preview the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available that you can call the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each picture . &quot;
&quot; view the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group set up instead of all groups of one centre as explained in . &quot;
&quot; with the selection list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the page you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called ki@@ pi and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . more information can be found on the website of ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call through the module itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules of multiple applications are used together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over ki@@ pi together are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that are using ki@@ pi , is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums : there &apos;s an album just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ates the order by albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; the current album , which is simply the current view , simul@@ ates all the pictures you see at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , each entry in this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category of people , you will be able to do so , so whether you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules that are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you and photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , see a menu and toolbar . at the moment , you will see the window with which you have entered your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information on the persons depicted on the picture , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view of three lists with a text field by defining people , places and keywords , they are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images in the list : if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , by moving the names used upwards , find and assign the people more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to see an alphabetical list of sorted lists , click on the sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected pictures and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail of the picture to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the note dialogue context menu you can add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it an sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by drag@@ ging the bar , which form the top of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the look of the window so to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and click here . &quot;
&quot; if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . for example , you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you dropped an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the image viewer . if you do not have a window with a thumb@@ nail viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and either click the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit menu from the Edit menu . now , the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use a solution for this problem . you can also use the images anywhere , without saving you on your hard disk . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere , so that you can record the images anywhere . in the picture you see the view of your photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this can be seen in pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for images 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can also view these images with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and then copy it back . &quot;
&quot; in the menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures so that at the end ones you want to make for others un@@ available and click on current view in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , control and block the menu item All except current view . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in case of the case . if you want to lock the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , so that all the pictures you have locked up will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very secure . on the one hand , all images can be accessed on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file index@@ .@@ xml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them some@@ time . for this reason , you have photo@@ album ; over a picture and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in view . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer . you can see the right context menu below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this page . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the Buttons image high and image below . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be checked by pressing Ctr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer you can move into the picture and zoom out . to zoom in , you can easily move a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the minus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ om@@ ed . with the Equ@@ al key the zo@@ oms set , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , that are in and out with the plus and minus key . &quot;
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can comment on the current image with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to preview the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and select them as good or bad , while you watch one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to indicate images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by setting the corresponding letters . in view , see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have features placed on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so you can see them in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD , or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can view categories in the thumb@@ nail , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you can use photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your mixture later . &quot;
&quot; in view of the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all the objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu . &quot;
&quot; if possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly to App@@ ly or Cancel the changes . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the View View . &quot;
&quot; click Preview in the View and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( e.g. texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can move these control points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse over the entire window . &quot;
each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility stage smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar .
the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also save several window orders and easily switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a available view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the new@@ bie in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card leader at the top of your views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to remove a view from anch@@ oring , drag the new@@ asser to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left at the top left of the bar . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the wall bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can paste additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with view window view ... Save . a dialog will be displayed in which you can save the window listing using an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , it was &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of rendering modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu of render Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step @-@ effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property are better . &quot;
when you switch Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is distributed over and over and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam per pixel . if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold , both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 pixels , a grid of 4 will be charged additional points , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch to J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er does not yet support &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if error messages or war@@ nings occur when impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the high level of detail for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further separated when the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you indicate wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you indicate the floor , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you tick edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window Reg@@ ulations section it explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the default window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views using the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with new column , you can create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ ors the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compla@@ in that as a result , you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu item Edit . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see for more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points to change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button App@@ ly or press Enter , the wire model views and the object tree are immediately changing according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example insert a rect@@ angle ( insert infinite body , fa@@ der ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : choose the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button App@@ ly or Enter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also indicates the level , even if at the moment only as limited fin@@ ite plane . when you render the scene , the plane exp@@ ands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment you choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you will see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you need to enter settings for the pigment again . therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview . also , there are many possibilities again , but now take the simpl@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and sphere in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then enter the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set right now . if you render your picture now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Ein@@ colored . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose each time in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; you should already be able to perform this step , as you should have understood the basic method of work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere can be created just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the button or the button user ) , so the ball would lift contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , since you have shi@@ fted the ground for one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material to you . as already with the floor , give the sphere a pigment as colour : &quot;
&quot; first select sub @-@ object and change the name for example in bul@@ let pig@@ ments . click on sphere pig@@ ments , then select one @-@ tone and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection result already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ting a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you will see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and re@@ places the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
you can only select this menu item if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ o command . this menu item can only be selected if you have used Edit Re@@ vert .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the key short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a b@@ ump map as well as for texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geometric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a image file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in your own window , or if all pictures should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the filename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching filename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Configuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display face is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when termin@@ ating the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
with this option the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large pictures . this option is turned on as default .
determine whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
click here to change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display case and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the digi@@ tization ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes its part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to report issues and wishes . all required information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to encourage you to answer other users &quot; users . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages , and you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure Indi@@ c@@ ators you can select the color chosen when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you should indicate , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ supply a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . you can also view them in image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning pictures that no longer makes it possible to scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning pictures , which no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner is opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel , &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options especially .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ preview and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when you preview a preview in the settings selected , then the image appears in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and s@@ ly leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; image saves them . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog in front of each captured image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you will need to select it without asking for a filename . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved on the Save button without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE via dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of this abbrevi@@ ation and their function . &quot;
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts work , making your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could &amp; z@@ b ; look like this : &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script doesn &apos;t run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialogue --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should contain any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings should be sent to the default input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; track@@ Change Sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the length ) . &quot;
volume Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ es a change in volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; to add an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to e.g. store data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such pack@@ ets are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can optionally be comp@@ ress with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cap@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can store it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag the music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ tive Browser and Quick Search will you find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is just the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; if you encounter problems , please report this to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok , like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met to allow them to be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help you develop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without trouble using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is turned off , only the playlist window will be displayed ( sh@@ own@@ 345 ) . &quot;
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ usable . the option turns on the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ usable . this alters the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; create mood files for music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ usable . if this setting is enabled , the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; saved ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ oo@@ combus@@ tible / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok , should be started when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
&quot; save playlist when performing , saves the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok , and activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist during the quit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ eping up @-@ to @-@ date piece of play shows that the play@@ lists windows are up / down , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection activated for for@@ eg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playback causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece at the place , with which it stopped at the last exit . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen display enables you to set up the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , preview the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas will open the dialog for color selection . if colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
the display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can set the screen of a multi monitor environment to appear in the O@@ SD . &quot;
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable even further adjustment options in this card card .
the card card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . it includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
search sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ folders search for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the play@@ lists automatically appear later in the playlist browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another device in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql facility is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on machine : will the host enter where the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is at@@ tain@@ able . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the loading card last@@ .@@ f@@ m uses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m a . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send broken pieces to update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the pieces played to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs thus installed ( including the programs contained therein , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files brings a bug in the Tag@@ lib library to days . you can locate the file by typ@@ ing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib @-@ developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , it is because tag@@ lib is cr@@ ashes when reading the Meta information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib @-@ developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if Z. B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to cr@@ ashes when editing the Meta information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send the back@@ trace by email ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open when crashing down ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the Meta information , but do not mark this as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &apos; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag / amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / Dynamic Pla@@ ylist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can see the status De@@ activate on Gray and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
&quot; there are several ways . most installation problems are most likely to be solved by the help of an expert , your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel . &quot;
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do you get music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start -@@ sub@@ window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Tools statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to rate pieces , the list column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop them there exactly as you would like to do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , next to the addition kno@@ b , the playlist is saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question is supporting g@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . g@@ stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , thus setting no MP3 de@@ or ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input box &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and output simultaneously audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; it does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media will need to be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t simply listen to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people when you need a decoder with little over@@ head . g@@ asp@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . g@@ stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s which can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; please use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less straps react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; g@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashed &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run g@@ st regi@@ sters to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download , compile and install it . then run g@@ st regi@@ sters , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ st regi@@ sters again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by Brit@@ a Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run it with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; rest@@ art playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ playing &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa is present .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok window . to do so , click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window . &quot;
the combination of Ctr@@ l + Right Mouse Button puts a piece in the queu@@ e sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the control panel &apos;s system section ? &quot;
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , you instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT @-@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , \ F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this is the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less impact each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for a piece yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by clicking on the item by right mouse button and edit : select the valuation or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want you to dict@@ ate when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not associated with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animated in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Settings Tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance Con@@ text Browser Design , click Add New Design ... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the Logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok , while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . then press Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click on the button Settings ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the pop @-@ up menu . &quot;
audio cro@@ bb@@ ler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine doesn &apos;t have to compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re @-@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ ITI@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the fault There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator g@@ st regi@@ sters . then start Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
&quot; setting Amar@@ ok Settings ... Audio output give you the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot;
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not super@@ vised . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to upgrade your collection , or simply do not like the wiz@@ ard , then you will be able to set up this Quick Start Guide . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist . you can find this button in the playlist of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then you can select different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select the audio CD from the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have here different options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or ap@@ t ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok , a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , including the creation of a collection and playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window you will find a running text display showing the current running piece or the current current stream . directly below is the area , the running time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . a click on this area will change the display of the already ex@@ pi@@ red playing time of the play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window lists a selection of audio analy@@ sers , also under the run text display . you can switch from the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , larger window . &quot;
&quot; under the run text display are also the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to setup equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . playback buttons can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right you find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context browser themes . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ windows startup has fallen away . the information presented there are now in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; distributed . in addition , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performers and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first part in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , the interpreter and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
&quot; under the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation . &quot;
&quot; the file formats .jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gif and .@@ png are supported . the context browser will also view cover images that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recom@@ men@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorites of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Search button opens a search for Google search for the current song ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - group@@ ed only the highest level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are left aside . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - At first , the pieces are arranged according to the interpreter and there will be another division after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list of various artists . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will be sorted by genre and below .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing according to your needs .
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
right under the toolbar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions to use this filter can be found in the playlist section in this manual .
&quot; the search filter is a selection box with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ ases the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to media player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queu@@ e for transfer@@ ring to the media player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player Browser .
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - so the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the selection - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it appears among various artists . &quot;
&quot; the album will then no longer be shown under various performers , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists are easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intelligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created Smart play@@ lists are also possible . click Intelligent Pla@@ ylist to open the dialog to create a new Intelligent playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; launched , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to interpreter sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the songs you want from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with a lot of files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can retri@@ eve music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to add files by simple drop down . in that case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : that way , dropped files can be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries using the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separated search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , complete the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not have the comment bad . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctr@@ l key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to click the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow reverse and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the center of the tool bar there is a unique , magni@@ fiable analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as shown in the player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example ren@@ ditions and volume control . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and de@@ activate the Status bar option in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . via this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
clicking on this entry will open the visu@@ alization plugin window . you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ e administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . using this feature you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queu@@ e , the playlist will appear in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; when you want to add a piece to the playlist , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist , or use the context menu in the playlist . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already present ( the details of the setup of these are later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your complete collection and add more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist is working .
&quot; double click on the playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select loading . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pres@@ et modes of random@@ ized mix and playlist mix will immediately fill out your playlist and you can add the playback directly . the Pla@@ ylist Number starts with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will be added at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : setting dynam@@ ical mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu item , the dynamic mode can be disabled again . &quot;
&quot; the New Pla@@ ylist button fil@@ ls the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
enter any name for the playlist here . however the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear any dup@@ licate in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the settings . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you stop here more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Configuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts to install by clicking on script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script for no longer , you can delete it . then click Un@@ install the script to delete . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please check in the Writ@@ ing Script section . &quot;

&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to follow the steps , you need to install &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and have a folder containing audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other lossy formats , remember that when re@@ encoding to MP3 you will receive a bad quality , no matter how high the bit rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a lossy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process . &quot;

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and handling audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 Enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a tool that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .

&quot; VC@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully featured author system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating Mix@@ ed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . click on an entry to open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filename . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed with which you can choose folders and file names for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file saving .
&quot; if a project changes and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ saved project that should be done exactly as if you were called for each project file closing .
includes all opened projects and end &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what to happen as if you had called the closing file .
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you drop the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you to see even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create an image of a CD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the converting / decre@@ asing a DVD with the help of copying dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog box asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ nr@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog box asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the table and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of toolbar equivalent of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is checked , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is enabled to select and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a nar@@ rower area , which is only visible if the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment at the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wiz@@ ard . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine @-@ tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the accompanying programs you give preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; run . then type something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ting DVD and other functions to create new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Movie CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Game@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Game@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Game@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Game@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void disk@@ s@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( Cur@@ l ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( cur@@ l ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Size e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then insert files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt
&quot; &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it easy audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files . also other formats are possible , depending on Enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files ( compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files are compressed to MP3 or OGG format or other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pr@@ to ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle protection , it is not possible to handle any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily way to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; retri@@ eve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without network , and everything is manually collected . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the step by step , for example , more information on how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab cards for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD data is started in accordance with the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - when an enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings in the Settings dialog - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read as the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings in the Setup dialog .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; ex@@ pi@@ red ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audio @-@ creator ; with different card cards ( like Enco@@ der , to setup the enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes tone quality , thi@@ cker and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may today have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important since both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is provided free of charge with most distri@@ butions but there are open license issues &quot;
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play@@ devices exists .
&quot; MP3 - when music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good allowance for music by young people , portable devices and car oster@@ e@@ o@@ anlagen . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ S@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolute highest quality without considering the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information which is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio @-@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio @-@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( referring to the translator ) is not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be hurt . any information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address when retri@@ eving the data is not used by the server ( this can only know the programmer who reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio Creator , which is set up for fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and res@@ embles the load between the computers . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates the database . &quot;
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save into WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; wh@@ os@@ oever wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . further information on enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
&quot; after installing a code , further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reader real on it and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; read . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame must already be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; try to copy it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio @-@ creator ; , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used as well as audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , the effective device name can also be used . if the drive can be accessed with other programs , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device design@@ ations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card general settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is as bel@@ ated / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; just select for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
&quot; note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name is changed with con@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , if you want to download the database beforehand , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server via the internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls support the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to send &amp; CD data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is one reason why more than one is at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , please tick this in to disc@@ ard the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folders for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files themselves . &quot;
&quot; the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances something must be pu@@ zz@@ led to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of WAV files at once : with a dual core or Quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is running . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b needs to pick up . the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for any read @-@ in &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look somewhat different from the data obtained for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of getting them out of the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , check the questions and answers in the Help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you did not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; and the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current Title &apos; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to obtain more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the read CD ; in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece . the title of the piece is in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title dates of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the unit list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the button All items select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button Select selection of the read @-@ out process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
click on the tab &apos;s orders to switch to the job window . it is located in the left upper half of the window directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully deco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting found to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . at performance weak machines , the result is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queu@@ e of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with C@@ VS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio @-@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many options for settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot keep this manual up . it &apos;s the first version for a guide to &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange when you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting the lyrics also have some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
&quot; session support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start again with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button depar@@ ting in the toolbar , select the item from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played in succession . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , playing a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the speed display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu item , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while not playing , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be represented and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song so you don &apos;t need to manually set the entry Autom@@ atic text selection , but you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify a type of event type , choose from the menu Settings menu items or song events . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summari@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy , and then specify the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones . &quot;
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can select the one in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not stored . consider this when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by button Ad@@ ding . it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automati@@ cally adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when adding Automati@@ cally to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then add the further opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to continue to jump a song , select the button Next Song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to turn around a song back , select the Previous piece , the preceding piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map is translat@@ ing General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all occur@@ ren@@ ces of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and can always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM ( including AW@@ E and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so , you must edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary translations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , however , that each occurrence has different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; An additional key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
please send me your map file as an email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument uses to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( Gun ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that with the term Drum Patch the patch means that each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ al instrument ( drums , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds can be m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to depic@@ t sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . look for example the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name is used for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use Patch x . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is given in which ratio Pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , this will be converted using the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM is suggest@@ ing that a keyboard is supposed to play a pitch benchmark event with the value 40@@ 96 , playing a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are trying to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the Channel View : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc , you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop , a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or h@@ acked ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file into the &amp; k@@ mid window . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ V . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play b@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to program , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I studied mathemati@@ cs at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathemati@@ cs at the university of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m not much free for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove to pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want anyone to get money for it . I want to stress that I am only going to program@@ mi@@ ere because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the bug that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ us support , Ign@@ aci@@ o Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use an FM unit or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ CR@@ U@@ AL parameter . it will run as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send error noti@@ fications directly to me . &quot;
&quot; a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so called do@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will be displayed only when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; after modi@@ fying XML files , you have to select from the menu Rem@@ ove with playlist and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost if you leave the editing mode or select another group without matching the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; S@@ ME players , some functions can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation of startup and termin@@ ating can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; S@@ ME@@ Player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying with the end animation but the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ MB ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this play@@ device in the Configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ ME ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , such as setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ ME players ; it can even add the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in playlist .
&quot; to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; S@@ ME player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ ME@@ Player ; can be started in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ ME player ; ( View , Con@@ sole , or Con@@ sole from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual alter@@ ing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ o should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; S@@ ME@@ s ; can be played by TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be installed , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( video recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of S@@ ME@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( pres@@ um@@ ably this type of playback of Video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ linux expansion for the X server needs to be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by S@@ ME@@ s for sources . at the time of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , tv@@ Scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not by the VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to be done as user root after plug@@ ging the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine slowly starts up and why does each time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ ght@@ . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; kill .
latex ; : a professional writing application . on Unix @-@ like systems probably the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users don &apos;t need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the K@@ ile ; -@@ website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or compile &amp; K@@ ile ; on or if extensions would be desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , immediate and custom access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to experience its options , the book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter Works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; latex ; is the correct pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ ered layout can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ begin { document } command . &quot;
the quick start @-@ up wiz@@ ard of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . some settings can also be done on the document .
&quot; document classes : here@@ with the type of document to be created is defined : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Projek@@ tor &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
coding : hereby the encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X is increasingly used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; latex ; for inclusion they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Articles ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t need to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides - as well as other sources of source Edi@@ tors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; K@@ ile ; it is likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic execution of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically generates an empty line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu Mode . set up ... La@@ TeX commands disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; latex . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; regulated file ) &#93; was created , j@@ umps &amp; K@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and other information as the font and is beside PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the search function , the elements of the DVI ; file is linked with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is . once on a section in the &amp; latex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding point is displayed in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project project preferences . &quot;
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( unless errors occur in source code ) .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit toolbar , you should see the three large selection fields . the selection fields were designed for fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for fast structuring of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for the division are : &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box possible ) .
&quot; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection box with the name GrÃ ¼ Ã en@@ e is used for the definition of written texts . it enables the written texts to be specified for the main text , the joints , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document can be written with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code is entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen und Kn@@ op@@ f Schnell@@ bau . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically stores the storage .
&quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in logging . if it is used for quick @-@ mounting &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with written number 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different written form . &quot;
changes are only visible within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands are either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the sive printing and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : create a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; nam@@ ing language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wiz@@ ard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be executed . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ View or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ ape ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; post@@ script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed out ( if the printer is properly set ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar enables conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the kno@@ ck in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries .
&quot; to carry out the search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicks on preference search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer takes place immediately . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; open and open to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as a text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; should a mistake occur when using Schnell@@ bau the &amp; DVI ; if an error occurs , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file displays the error source in the source code . in the editor , there is always a line where the error appears . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the error in the log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; K@@ ile ; j@@ umps to the wrong line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the respective button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when choosing blank document , a document may either be re@@ written or the wiz@@ ard can be used for quick creation of a new document . more information about this can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; member users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; K@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or create a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selection of file template from document ... Cre@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings General settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in the document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way the following steps must be executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , the template can then be selected instead of the default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created . in a simple way to create a template , one should search for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be searched . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; uses &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and impor@@ ting from many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for and can be made directly from &amp; K@@ ile ;
&quot; for more about &amp; kate ; and to experience its possibilities , the book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter Works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the Men@@ Ã ¼ Hilfe La@@ TeX reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; word . that means that if you click \ \ par \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par will be selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the various types of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can add additional jumping marks . this is a very own type of book@@ marks within the text . the volume items Do not exceed the jump to the next or last jump stamp . in this case , the jump stamp is highlighted , so that when entering a character , it is automatically deleted . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; although , though &amp; kate ; already outstanding possibilities , were added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; quot ; source code added . &amp; K@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; a paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning exclu@@ des tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only beu@@ tiful thing in &amp; K@@ ile ; is that the distances are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; commands with a stir@@ rer ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to solve a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers with its own commands for qui@@ cker possibility . under Edi@@ ting Rem@@ ove , the following commands are included in the text : &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit out@@ sole paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for additional commands in the Edit environment for a simple work with &amp; latex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { surrounding } , it will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the above @-@ mentioned environment can be lost . this command will close the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit TeX group , a few important commands that match those from editing environments . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
&quot; if the cursor occurs before or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted shi@@ fted groups brackets can be lost quickly , the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be broken . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign is used for two simple calls . also for the completion of the application , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and lead to two closing call@@ sign for &amp; latex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double connection marks can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX can be switched on and off .
there are also many other languages available .
&quot; if the current position is within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; K@@ ile ; not just a new@@ line but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table setting , the current line with \ \ \ \ with an anti @-@ as@@ leep line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; K@@ ile ; tries to achieve this . while pressing Shift , Alt ; amp ; search &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the current row . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already a good source code completion offers , this was added in &amp; K@@ ile ; to add special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . it is possible to set up specific commands ( usually for &amp; latex ; ) . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings K@@ ile ... ampli@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , unfortunately , the complete list can be enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command . alternatively by &amp; K@@ ile ; also ho@@ cks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible by editing jumping marks . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; you can make adjustments to these lists . you can select different types of wine lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands , as well as alarm parameters of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . it must always have a few characters to be entered with \ \ begin . on the other hand , the environment will have a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the exp@@ ander mode over the menu item or the key Alt + Shift key Spac@@ ebar , the command to open the environment automatically and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient ampli@@ fication can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key will be completed . &quot;
&quot; after this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; K@@ ile ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be filled with . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile ; Setup ... K@@ ile ; exp@@ and@@ able settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the alarm list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; however , it has been found that many guards are written in a document more than once . thus , it offers &amp; wed@@ ges ; the completion for all already written guards . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the K@@ ile menu Mode ... K@@ ile can be broken down . here , the threshold value can also be set for the display of the completion . &quot;
&quot; the encryption files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the Graphics dialog is designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics on the graphic formats , the sections should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all the building tools are group@@ ed together in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ate Comp@@ iling , Cre@@ ate Shift and Cre@@ ate View . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used with Alt ; 2 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the Project Project New Project ....
&quot; when running the filename window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the extraction environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&amp; latex ; is a quite limited system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents , including documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; commands are included and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; K@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the Find of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or keyword . by &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space button opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ op@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; -@@ source code editor , which can be installed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ similar systems . &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; K@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the progress of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project , and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all under observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU , license . &quot;

output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time pro@@ c starts .
&quot; as I said before , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for that . &quot;
&quot; if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then you simply leave the current file . if not , delete the check@@ box at current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check selection . &quot;

&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then leave the current file simply . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file cho@@ oser . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result is named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the f@@ ake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin editing with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the included plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location it uses qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several persons in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for un@@ am@@ big@@ uous identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Set button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) will appear bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important with regard to news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage through the gathering of the team members : it can be an event for information about team leaders when something is happening . see for more detailed information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone has worked on or sending a message when a file is backed up to the C@@ VS once they are added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the Event Configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an e @-@ mail is sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
you can enter comments from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a permanent member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the team leader sub @-@ project leaders should be given the respective area or sub @-@ project leaders , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of large or small caps but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers a number of pages that are treated after each other .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion , it can be changed . entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / Small writing of tags : large / small writing of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / small writing means , the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small attri@@ bution of attributes : large / small writing of automatically inserted attributes . normal case sensitive , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; automatically Update start and finish tag : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters to the corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files .
standard Trans@@ coding : the encoding of newly created or in other way than with File Open opened files ( where encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . but this setting here will be st@@ amped by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created perio@@ dic@@ ally backup copies so that during a power failure or crash during the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in one &apos;s own View ( or the documentation in a tab bar ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come across by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning messages section provides taxes of the possibility to disable the display of war@@ nings by hooks of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in its divided mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser ver@@ tices in the document , can be adjusted in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action makes it possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such as no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin during startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin does not deny charging . only @-@ read @-@ k@@ PAR@@ T@@ s usually refuse the loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ designed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implement@@ ations of plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert . &quot;
&quot; using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all post@@ ures , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view showing the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally it does not have to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start running the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , the execution will be continued . if this is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without giving information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution starts . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the instruction and go to the next , as if there were not the current ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set .

&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day . the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow fast inser@@ tion of tags into a document without a risk of writing errors . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders apply the name of the writing language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users can gain a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a daily XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the Tag Editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only happen once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type .
indicates a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration starts : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will disappear , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog box is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ M@@ L. . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filename for this tag should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the filename of this tag should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as fairly simple and there is an editor for re@@ achable via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = U@@ sing 1 for &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action for the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User Language button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the controlled settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way to find : global script folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we replace the current document &apos;s URL . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can take input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the selection box input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; in accordance with the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages sent to the default output output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . in any given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar .
&quot; complete all and , in case the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that input when using the action is possible . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us replace it , before we have trouble . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Visual other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green usually appears as loose , sti@@ ff , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ alized a message to the user that clicking this icon will be inserted ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
press the button and continue with other tags as there are or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups .
&quot; after selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note how separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new toolbar must be tested by exam@@ ining all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; when new e@@ XML does not exist , it will create im@@ root folders , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc , language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the Docum@@ entation Tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so somewhat : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = introduc@@ tion@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the content directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but watch &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files are replaced .
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing Ctr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are certain that these are well and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you won &apos;t be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an email sending menu item such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , sending tool bars toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download it . the contributions will be checked and only available if our team needs them to be correct and useful for publication . to make a real contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for our team as well as for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start upload . &quot;
&quot; upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D File menus ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , exam@@ ining &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems war@@ ns it and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
doc@@ type definition : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to use the full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; thus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is selected as globally , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; stored . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development funds for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that only this user can use it personally . &quot;
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool bars with special promotions especially for the files of a particular project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ Window , the building man@@ hood , the boards with information and the tool bars . please strike in , and for more detailed information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the card leader with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , like closing the current , other or all card riders , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area lead to another context menu for the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( copy / paste / paste ) , edit the file under the mouse po@@ inter , or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the toolbar can be found . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional is shown as standard for which a set of tool bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and the associated user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields . &quot;
&quot; building man@@ sions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with tab@@ s are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation building views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; providing this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ e@@ tion of files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refres@@ h of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , some can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented application system enables the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot; &quot; Docum@@ entation site &quot; , &quot; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tra@@ ilers at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command . the chocolate width of the tool bars is the possibility of defining your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to define .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive by e @-@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other one ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf gives a number of options to be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems in starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid Web development and combines an mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while stri@@ ving to create the best &amp; HTML code editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what has already developed someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool bars , it is possible to extend the automation of almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and super@@ vised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list will be changed every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest item is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters included in the &amp; HTML ; case , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
enables or off block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script reports error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of script actions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
activation and activation of the problem @-@ repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as one changes to the structural tree .
displays the column column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; managed by the project . in chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find details . &quot;
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in Project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . that only creates the name . actions must be saved by settings actions ... added to the toolbar , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; removing a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment . &quot;
&quot; enables up@@ loading of tool bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own label format .
&quot; load / refres@@ h entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug is disabled . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available emphasis schem@@ ata depends on the posters ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; inst@@ ant@@ aneous switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching time may need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
align@@ s the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or which can be added and the sequences can be changed . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the context of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with each open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out best from top to bottom , as for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file is automatically filled out . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ amp@@ le.com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote machine , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set rather than the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard . &quot;
this allows you to add files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in ser@@ vers@@ y scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the project &apos;s main folder , if a project is started from scratch . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection according to Gut@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the key short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) which will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this way , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed will be supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , holding its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window you can switch event actions and add or delete events , modify or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at present . &quot;
to open another project select Project Open Project ... from the menu project or icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog Project will open up and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; modified files will be . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are opened and open with ... in the right mouse button context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; enables the removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be cut off to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ afe password on the disk will not be available . &quot;
&quot; this will stop the transfer , or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them after your discretion . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply swa@@ p the view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar , accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which you can do most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are toolbar bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to customize the toolbar . use and add are different . adding tool@@ bars is handled at the bottom of the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which other actions can be removed , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and set the settings actions ... set .
&quot; templates are basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations that one imag@@ ines for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template prior to usage .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with img src = / src / ur@@ l ) .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole sites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As a template to save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As a template to store selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary template is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files tree view and create site template , secure a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can present head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically integrate with &amp; PHP ; shape , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of them corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click on the folder in the template folder with the right mouse button and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ inded as soon as the parent attributes are inher@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so , it would de@@ activate templates in this path , except they would appear explicitly . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text tag . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this might be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( click on it , press right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor , which can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode re@@ places the source text editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second editor will divide the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML , page and a cursor . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . in order to edit &amp; PHP , there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes both in the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is activated in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , pressing the button the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be adjusted via Settings Qu@@ anta ... After selecting V@@ PL ; View can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the title of the web page , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click in the list allows the change of the content e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of shaping pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is as usual . the cursor works as usual . the text can be inserted through typ@@ ing , and removed by button @-@ key or remot@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is done in the same way via the tool bars , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other bo@@ iled anchor tag must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool bars like the table wiz@@ ard or the lists wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for checking style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ iling &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to successfully compile , need apart &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml which are already present at a typical install of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new to x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , wa@@ i@@ est stops can be set in a specific file and line number and be activated later . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a filename without path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded Stil@@ vor@@ lage file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl is possible the following entry :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ diction called my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a given mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP NAS containing the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL code file . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a sought @-@ after holding point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a program for de@@ bug@@ ging ( de@@ bug@@ ging ) in X@@ SL style templates ( X@@ SL = e@@ X@@ ten@@ sible Styl@@ es@@ he@@ et Language ) . &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; has similar commands like Unix / Linux Deb@@ ug@@ ger g@@ db . there are three ways to execute a style template :
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g --@@ shell --@@ cd &amp; lt ; PAT@@ H@@ gt ; --@@ par@@ am &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; : lt ; VAL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; --@@ long &amp; lt ; --@@ length --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ timing --@@ verb@@ ose --@@ profile --@@ g@@ db --@@ auto@@ en@@ code --@@ ut@@ f@@ 8@@ input --@@ revision _ --@@ st@@ d@@ out --@@ Auth@@ est@@ art + X@@ SL@@ Source + X@@ ML@@ Data
start a shell . then type the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; -@@ command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of help .
adds the parameter to the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; VAL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL ambient variables . see also the documentation on the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
&quot; if the conversion takes 20 times , if --@@ repeat is two times a@@ indicated , the conversion will be executed 100 times &quot;
the input documents are treated as HTML files when the support has been enabled in lib@@ xml
activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document when the support has been activated in lib@@ xml . it is turned on as default .
&quot; on systems with the Re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can scroll down / down with the arrow keys on / off by the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the executed commands . &quot;
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is set a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as x@@ sl : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name .
&quot; filename : a valid local filename on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems , other environment variables are allowed . &quot;
path : a path to changing the working folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML @-@ data or the XML _ document which is edited by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and &amp; lt ; U@@ RI@@ gt ;

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ ing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of modern color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can ease your typ@@ ing by writing only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; &lt; div &gt; c &apos;t u@@ pl@@ ink 14.@@ 4 : Smart@@ watches , Schn@@ ü@@ ffel @-@ Add @-@ ons , PS@@ 4 Pro , Nintendo Classic Mini &lt; / div &gt; &quot;
&quot; open dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with compar@@ ing / mer@@ ging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active compar@@ ative window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , insert them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , insert and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as ej@@ ection and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small relief window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see the color which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good to see . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separ@@ ating the composition column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the filename and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to the nearest solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be highlighted in all windows , and the first line of the group will be shown . &quot;
&quot; sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or manually editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line is displayed in the queu@@ e ; this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; when you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , high , down , page on , side , start , end , Ctr@@ l beginning and Ctr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert key , you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( default is insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous difference ( Ctr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start . ( setting Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Setup ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays scripts with variable width to choose , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ o@@ unded . on these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences will automatically display an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , the number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press Enter or Return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the manual into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when compar@@ ing files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a &apos; \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only one character slot . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is activated by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow on very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the auto @-@ ski@@ p mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then you can better use the choice of choices in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ es C / C + + comments are enabled . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see documentation for the folder comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be added to the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if there is already such backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and rest@@ art so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center . )
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; through the selection fields for coding , a short notice appears what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and mer@@ ged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are enabled . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color enco@@ ded over@@ si@@ fier column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C is displayed next to the normal or a second column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider differences and then choose to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art mer@@ ging again , then the name of the last used file is maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first commit to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword = \ \ $ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for new@@ line . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit .
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ icol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions . example :
&quot; where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for the display and mer@@ ging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorith@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally detect certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and displays the simul@@ ated changes without really performing them ;
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog .
&quot; if three folders are mer@@ ged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , folder @-@ 3 is used as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window on the current progress . if you cancel the folder scanning , only the files will be listed which have been compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub @-@ directories open and all sub@@ directories open with which you can expand or fold all folders .
&quot; double @-@ clicking on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the mer@@ ging action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; however , for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then folders have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the sync mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to ensure that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; when two folders are mer@@ ged and select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors will not be removed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging , a file will be processed after the other . you status column shows Fer@@ tig when the mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected happened . if the mer@@ ging is complete , you should check out a last check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file compar@@ ative method is selected full @-@ time analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is displayed only when three folders are compared or mer@@ ged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all mer@@ ging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the Three Folder Mer@@ ge mode C is used as the target , when two folders merge , B is selected as target and when synchron@@ izing a B and / or B is used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to ski@@ p certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current item : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears which indicates the defective element . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with options , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes , then you will receive a detailed list of all the actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work with the next entry will continue . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the item or solve the problem in a different way before you proceed with mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were mer@@ ged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not go together again . even if the mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be mer@@ ged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by C@@ VS . the great advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a prec@@ ated point marks a file than hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links are shown . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is turned on , the links will be compared as normal folders . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and check recur@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; the full analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower when applied to files containing no text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed limit will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date is lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure as it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ original If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge views will be visible to merge individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der using the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can disable the Options Directory &amp; Text window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is a corresponding menu item in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : list menu : read new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters need to be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of trust of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP starts with the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the file &apos;s file is a patch file in the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports compar@@ ing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or compar@@ ing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is called compact ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge with the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs very long and learned a lot by listening to the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or going to go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from sources and probably not know the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical . if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort was so far too big . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text should be used to use another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src has been left , and the text cannot be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system that K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it . &quot;
cut ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or re@@ places the current selection .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Ref@@ res@@ h function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed showing the differences . this also causes identical files when mer@@ ging not to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior is probably changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ chi@@ ede in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , exit or move it . this works both inside a desktop as well as several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops , as well as the applications running it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background von &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager setup ... and Finish . if , however , the symbol and name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . the commands effect the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; mark this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ inal Numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as the background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default icon and pixel display shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally adjustable &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N file , as known from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row appear in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch of switch ... the dialog settings can be displayed .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings .@@ You can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : including artists , web designers and people with visual im@@ pair@@ ments . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ like ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the picture shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , the area around the mouse po@@ inter looks like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can show &amp; k@@ like ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that it is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; Mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you are using the &amp; Shift , push or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to add it to other applications later ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
stop or stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your default short commands to save files , open a new window , print , new@@ line ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Zoom &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( type either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .
magni@@ fier ; was developed by Olaf Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are Sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ sf@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster for@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter per@@ si@@ sts for a while at the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is waiting for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and which each mouse click creates pain . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you break the movement .
&quot; the smart move is activated , power &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . this way you can run the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this wei@@ ghting time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on a mouse click .
&quot; this is the time set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , the time of the mouse button is waiting , before moving the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function is activated in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ ders sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , will &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already press the button App@@ ly , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of users . &quot;
&quot; first use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart post@@ p@@ one . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not link any link , does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore use the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse j@@ ump@@ ed , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can scra@@ pe you easily with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click yourself . this will be the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor at another point . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor here where you want to have it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ cker . secure zones for mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with smart shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to select text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you are just starting to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus each time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button controls a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test Extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and are correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is short , this program was developed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome and which prepar@@ es pain of the Mau@@ sta@@ sten pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a drag @-@ down process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be performed using the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the stup@@ id user can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , stup@@ id users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text pass@@ wd @-@ book . from the text pass@@ able books you can select often used text passages without having to typ@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org Dictionary so that only properly spoken words can be included in the words of words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a default memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have set the mouth ; you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . each set is attached to the exp@@ iry memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the side of the words and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as a default input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ on language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first sel@@ ective field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text pass@@ code book , or in the bar for text pass@@ codes . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant contact , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the memory memory . by selecting into the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box closing the editing window for text pass@@ code log , you can specify whether the text@@ book code should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ code book , the book will be saved . if you choose to reject changes , the text password log will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be saved . &quot;
in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary .
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.org &apos;s dictionary to insert correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks what dic@@ tion@@ aries are mer@@ ged , and how to wei@@ gh them . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you insert a new empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically inserts into the dictionary , in the course of time you generate a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main pane of the window for editing text pass@@ codes is divided into two . in the upper part the text pass@@ able sheets are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key short@@ cut . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; to add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the sequence of text pass@@ codes or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a sliding toolbar can be displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by clicking on the left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a sliding bar is displayed for text pass@@ able sheets with entries . by clicking on the left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably you did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not fully entered . open Settings sh@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card card speech output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ overs @-@ system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ aks folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax enjoys the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ Manual / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option data will be switched on as default input .
&quot; the voice @-@ overs from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ tp@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth installation dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , leave text by calcul@@ ator . a list of spoken phrases is stored , which the user can always re @-@ spend . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer you have to install a voice syn@@ thesizer .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service consisting of modules , which enables any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers ready to be equipped with T@@ TS abilities with which their applications also offer interesting possibilities .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
&quot; speech output is based on the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the generation of voice outputs to the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
&quot; in ZU@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ overs from &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list above https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use , you need to install and set speech speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card card spokes@@ person will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card will be displayed in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . &quot;
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printer @-@ printers for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the card leader spokes@@ person in kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr , the card card spokes@@ person will appear . &quot;
all speakers that are already arranged appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application has no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; t@@ art system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and female voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card card spokes@@ person . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &amp; k@@ de Language Registration System . click on the card tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will keep K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS System from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the preview window in the control panel , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can start , stop , pause and record text applications . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card tab General and tick language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time the speech output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ ten@@ ders and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; out ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , noti@@ fying you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel , where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu Settings menu . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , which is part of the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it remo@@ ves tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ umed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filtering , text is edited before it is sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace mis@@ pronounced words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is read , the stopped orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read more . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you want from the card card , is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text requests are meant for the output of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters work the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be more types of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined character strings like : - ) by text , or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; ct@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice for example on the card card spokes@@ man , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter states that its rules are not applicable , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a notice ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters , which have been set up on the page . editing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and the following list dialog@@ s will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; to set up strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . &quot;
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and re@@ places it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you will receive the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you are allowed to enter only copies . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; by compar@@ ing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( space ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translat@@ es &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such formats . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c also extends to x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; with the voice selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card card spokes@@ person , or to a speaker with certain attributes . you can , for example , specify that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; Skip a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it with one click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to get faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the above mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialogue selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your spokes@@ person settings or delete all settings .
the selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , which can be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice syn@@ thesizer , so that you can use these syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the Voice Output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand speech output via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text to read and select a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you can specify

none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; remo@@ ver filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE does not work at all . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or just ch@@ ew@@ ing cat@@ fish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be solved by using a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ accessibility with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code from k@@ de@@ accessibility at ftp : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; KT@@ TS also works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . hence , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; to use another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile &amp; t@@ ts , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including package k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility , or downloaded the tar@@ ball you currently created , install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g program should be developed so that the set up of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sets . the user can go back to sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if you pass text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a spokes@@ man , the language of English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click Add to add a spokes@@ person on the list , and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card card will display Spe@@ aker Setup . for example , you will find below the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . please refer to the modules below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text that will be passed to Festival . in the case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you can adjust volume , speech and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this gray , the voice you selected does not allow you to select these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices , such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require multiple seconds to load . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory usage ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a spokes@@ person ( or click App@@ ly to App@@ ly to App@@ ly ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr symbol in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are performed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the job , the current state of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or go back in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be reduced and kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de instead , click on the card card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . output of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the types of messages of &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to . &quot;
&quot; here , select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use g@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if there are no output modules in the list , you must install at least one module . if you choose AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is equivalent to half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt select standard .
&quot; on this map card , you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech messages : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader is read , the stopped orders will be res@@ umed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as eg ; processor gets too hot reserved . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pronoun@@ ces news . if you let &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card pass only apply to normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read aler@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event meets , you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you select Custom Text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker that will appear in the list on the card card spokes@@ person as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , this is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All noti@@ fications for the default application ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the following noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events will be mer@@ ged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries besides All Noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , sex , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations exist :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the default voice used for the SS@@ ML output . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C &quot; - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ synthesis / synthesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ synthesis / syn@@ thes@@ is.@@ dt@@ d ? &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds sign text into single sentences . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire text order . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters will be set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other del@@ im@@ itation filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the selection of spokes@@ person sel@@ ects by trying . switch off the selection of words and select text to read . if you select the voice selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then start reading faster , because only the first pro@@ position must be processed and not the entire block of text , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter will automatically set up when you start kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , just be removed . don &apos;t change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ lat@@ ator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter maintains the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal del@@ im@@ itation filter from mistake , you can insert it again by load the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the interface selection , you can over@@ write the Speech settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if you want &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card card spokes@@ man ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is closest to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired Speech Properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; choose the characteristics of the speaker you want . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when issu@@ ing the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is preferred if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the specified in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all properties in the speaker area , which is closest to the following , click the standard speaker , and then use Spe@@ aker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ m@@ gr falls down immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command g@@ st @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have loaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in Festival , but kt@@ om@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ t@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices . as a guide , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you found the voice , to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the card card audio , there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ mod@@ ul@@ s like Festival Interactive are offering a setting for speed depending on the selected voice . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are fully cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML forming filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag does not seem to function . so that festival doesn &apos;t produce any errors , the x@@ sl file will re@@ vert to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tag . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate string replacement filter and now I am able to go to &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more starting or going back . on the board tra@@ ys jobs will be shown , the order only consist of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ icol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ality detection . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
&quot; g@@ stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts , the command g@@ st regi@@ sters . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start reading a text . if you want to start a text job and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the intercom speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the ap@@ t @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
&quot; if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least just created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . for example &quot;
on Deb@@ ian systems / usr / local is the correct folder for programs compiled from sources .

&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with a festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . so look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then takes over the lexi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German lyrics . more information can be found here .
&quot; with this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder will be installed , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS English Festival is a modified version of the Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the file RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 you don &apos;t need to re @-@ play the bug@@ fixes , you just need to re @-@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; ) ( voice @-@ location &quot; german _ de@@ 2 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you must edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . currently , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 votes will not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this procedure uses special code to express the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; first hand , and install the festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure they both work . &quot;
un@@ pack the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PAT@@ H .
load the CZ@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; Festival Lite is a freel@@ ance language syn@@ thesizer , which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . search fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer , which works with Di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o translat@@ es text in Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language syn@@ thesizer makes it sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
load at least one german language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the filename . &quot;
choose a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; Epo@@ s is a freel@@ ance language syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS voice syn@@ thesizer . if the Epo@@ s programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the board . enter in a &amp; console ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ oted voice syn@@ thesizer , written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; java you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console , on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; shown . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ conf allows you to set the device at all and enable the setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option Network Settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release . by selecting non @-@ recur@@ ring queries , the setting can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can be viewed only , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the network interfaces tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... set up in the device dialog .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to open the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server in automatic mode . DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the drop @-@ down list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP you can set the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface for bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or turned off depending on your needs . switching of a switched network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking of interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off depending on your needs . activ@@ ating an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
&quot; speci@@ fies the host IP address in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support re@@ places a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the machine requests http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS releases its name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution of the name resolution part of the registered name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Ad@@ ding ... from the group computer to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will appear the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There will display the dialog box . &quot;
the list by name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting if there is no DNS server available . in small closed networks it is possible to replace DNS servers .
&quot; normally , the list contains some known calcul@@ ators some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP is intended to replace in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar host and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar host and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press the button Add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a particular known computer from the list and select Edit .... Edit your dialog box will be displayed .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to enable the changes , you need to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a GUI can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are required . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users , but it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never been widely spread . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is attri@@ but@@ able . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a reserved area dedicated to this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , so their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses usually are used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ privilege ; .0@@ .0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 The first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section you will find the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file sometimes dynam@@ ically changes in DSL connections , so it is not surprising to find another content as specified in case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is acci@@ dentally group@@ ed by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .
&quot; all the others who have been forgotten to lead here , you know who they are you @ foo@@ .t@@ ld &quot;

print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the sched@@ ules of users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , sel@@ ective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you backup ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ res@@ sing information of the band . if you don &apos;t know the band , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ann , it looks for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the band has been resolved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be form@@ atted before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DAT drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity , the band continues . all the data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured , which can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only save this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the Backup dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item Test ....
&quot; once the test is started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ produce the restore , the files that should be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the File menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Rest@@ ore will appear . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re@@ build the band index file on the basis of the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
&quot; in this way , a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be found separately in the backup files . each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; co@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command loads load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the option is turned on and tries to block the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . it may not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , it will automatically be disc@@ ar@@ ded if the band is inserted ; do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , you are trying to change the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ghty block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the band has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a locking tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables users to access information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer does in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system stores the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some extended functions , with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among other things include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , you are trying to open the system protocol , first of all , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not show you , and it opens instead of its a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you usually do not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log folder for normal users . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected crit@@ erion , or by typ@@ ed strings . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter @-@ search term will then only be compared with entries in the corresponding column . select for example in the log file system log the column process , and also apply in the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level Error are shown with a more striking color as protocol lines of level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled in the setting dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command like e.g. for the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the pop @-@ up context menu of the main window , to display all new added minutes lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol for displaying in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the System V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start using the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when doing the boot . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a little confused , then you can repair it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts manually from the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the start argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to configure machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here , you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between running level@@ n or change the position within one level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are shi@@ fted if you move them into a new area . to only copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the Sor@@ ti@@ ght@@ number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore records thrown in the tr@@ ash . be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to enable the different work@@ spaces ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , drag it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired running level with Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting code or the name of an entry manually , press Enter key to open the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ners , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press Enter key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE , or del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears to the user / group properties dialog . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space constra@@ ints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other card cards appear if Shadow Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the password management card appears , if Shadow Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card card appears only if it is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one built @-@ in file system constra@@ int ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the limited space constra@@ ints are in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space constra@@ int
&quot; the card card groups inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ rose group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the group dialog properties contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user on the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot the standard operating system , remove , remove , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , and more . &quot;
