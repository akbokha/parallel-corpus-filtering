<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; is to visualize nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. tree-maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the TreeMap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color alignment and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched via View Color Mode, can either display depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or mapping of any other file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (hence representation errors can be set by restrictions on the sign of TreeMap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of display algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the TreeMap in & FSView, this target is not always maintained."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is possible for the labeling and avoiding space losses through frames always advantageous to divide the rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive divisions."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may be used to connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras that supported an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communicating with your computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers across the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images using gPhoto2. you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to have been created with libexif support to be able to read the thumbnails of digiKam.

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-administered workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a coloradministered workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those from your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with more information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow fulfils all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color administration."</seg>

<seg id="381">"your only other image outputs are via email or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you then use another colour space and thus have to worry about color administration?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calliate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you have to calliate your monitor since sRGB is leaving the circle. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, synchronize, automatic synchronization and contrast expand from the menu correcting Automatic correction try automatically to make the most of your colors the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminosity values across the whole picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"in this way, nearly every brightness range achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces a very powerful operation which causes miracles in an image or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic synchronization: this method maximizes the range of colours in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a re-jiaded of all values in between. this is only visible in full-washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-levelling correction is a bit limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Color White balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image and the preview of the tool can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original copy right again, then click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top, a histogram is shown that dynamically changes once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The Overexposure Indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Save as and load exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance that you have set you can save to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences tab returns all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, processing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw pictures. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color tone mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use it for more photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the correction correction you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digicone; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects, a solar vibration effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar polarization was also called sabatians, an effect was created by placing a partially developed pressure from the additional light. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper by the additional light. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar polarization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia features very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The NeonFilter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the valve repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large pictures the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can view the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be seen in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool plays sound correction for the improvement of exposure."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the knob and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side you can view the original and preview the image. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic layout is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma-values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pinpens can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to interactively change the output values as in the input values. for example, compression of the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and store: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later. for this, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a picture. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere Canal: this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module:</seg>

<seg id="479">& digicone; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it's very fast and easy, but it produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was removed from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photographs without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process of colors with minimal differences must be summarized. thus, the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner addresses a focal depth already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening keener. you can call it with the menu entry Corrigating sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should be careful because the results are not very natural: sharpening increases sharpness of edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, you can refocus the tool to sharpen an image. you can refocus on the menu entry. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Corrigate plasticizing and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents one how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference to be applied to a edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpening and therefore avoid beauty mistakes in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). fuzzy masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocussing a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular fission works much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel that is far from the original source pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels. the causes undesirable results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this is the radius of the circular fold. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, the filter can accept values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"palate's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate 's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness is palate. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrizensize: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the palate's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocussing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to do all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave uncomfortable artefacts later."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masking produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking use a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, Unsharp masking must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter you can show that it is the optimum linear filter."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp picture image must be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of field correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator smoothes the sharpness of the area of the darkened area, in order to create a more natural pupil."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour tincture allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unparalleled speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inaugural algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details."</seg>
<seg id="520">"orientation Depth alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes uniformly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-gritt or CCD-noise, a high value will create wavy pattern. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated stepwidth in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation use: the increase in quality that you receive by choosing this option is only minor. however, it doubles the running time. we recommend it to leave it."</seg>
<seg id="527">Save as and load exactly this. any setting of picture errors can be saved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">"errors can be corrected comparatively very fast in the work. however, it can take very long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors were removed with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>

<seg id="535">"the radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing at the front of the filter to determine the brightness changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls edge accuracy for the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise cannot be removed or cracks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Brightness: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which controls the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma tolerances of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly smoked, but also destroys the shadow areas too."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of phase absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove smokes and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and Load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is labeled with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction has been applied to the default settings.</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">"square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square bends (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="569">"with the large exposure ranges of today's film and color or grey stage depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a picture. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of absorption of light at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture adjustment of 1, or randomly to compensate the density in order to compensate a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a finer re-adjustment of exposure to the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use gradation from the & digicard; image processing from the Color Gradation menu."</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you bubbles a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the size you want with the tool size."</seg>
<seg id="632">"changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, try the tool to bubbles."</seg>
<seg id="633">The underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures."</seg>

<seg id="643">"in the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners using the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool to cut to aspect ratio, you can indicate the orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format."</seg>
<seg id="645">"cut the tool to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog box, there are two buttons to set the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the dialog box, you can use the Max ratio button to cut the area to cut to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the altered frame dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the settings of the assembly help make it possible to blend with aids, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangles are based on the principle of similarity.</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden middle is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blades of flowers of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides more liquid help lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition takes the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river on this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles also derive from the above-mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not an equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be seen a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic Symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">Mirroring options horizontally and vertically can be used to mirror the harmonic divides.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Colour you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera out vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees again. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transforming Zutrimming from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the function Automatically cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivical transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:"</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you missed the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cropping out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the shading tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left."</seg>
<seg id="679">"create your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can shears horizontally and vertically. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown to the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shading tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have performed the shear, the picture is wiped a little. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two shearings generating twice as much blurp and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after shearing, the picture has triangular perforations in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transforming cropping out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"it requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiliated."</seg>
<seg id="684">"due to this dependency on other libraries, it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below."</seg>
<seg id="685">"this is done by file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can modify this list of file extensions that came and digitized; you can modify this list of file extensions that have come and digitised; you can find more information in the configuration section."</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digitization; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">"image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. in this way, redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way."</seg>
<seg id="688">"JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free when specified in the settings."</seg>

<seg id="919">First enter the title of the survivor and a description containing the HTML file later. on photoalbum; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">"next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. see more information about export files in."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information showing the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are displayed by a party. note that all images are exported by a party. therefore, you can not use this setting to hide specific images from certain viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically discussed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images. therefore, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images that, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, it can search your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission period. if it wants to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first you need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible for viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created. otherwise, the URL that you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. thus, the import function, look correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings described above have all three related to base folders or URLs. in these settings, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting at the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time for viewing the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not even do once."</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file directly from the File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this is an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kim file searches the images in a two-fold way. first, it searches the images that are in the file of the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you created when creating the HTML files are searched."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Export... menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">"the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files, and the following three choices are available:"</seg>
<seg id="938">"on the Manual button near the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy the option Automatically to the vicinity of the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the images are automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">".kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size since the .kim file would be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu item... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import, then in which folder the import pictures should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category of persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the file to be imported and which categories they match in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can synchronize the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it just has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>
<seg id="947">"in this manual, you will find the various steps of (1) Setting up the information about your images, through (2) searching and viewing, through to (3) advanced themes and customization options."</seg>
<seg id="948">"KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures, but often this also includes videos."</seg>
<seg id="949">"& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal Backup Tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS."</seg>

<seg id="960">"the applications that use the modules over kipi together are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that are using kipi, is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums: there's an album just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, simulates the order by albums so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step-effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property are better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch Anti-Aliasing and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighbouring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is distributed over and over and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam per pixel. if the difference between color values exceeds the given threshold, both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4 pixels, a grid of 4 will be charged additional points, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels which are individually followed and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch to Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument uses to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (Gun), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that with the term Drum Patch the patch means that each sound represents another percussional instrument (drums, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how sounds can be mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to depict sounds on the percussions channel. look for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap with the name name is used for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use Patch x."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio is given in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, this will be converted using the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM is suggesting that a keyboard is supposed to play a pitch benchmark event with the value 4096, playing a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a little bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD shows the speed with which one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can't force anybody, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc, you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2056">"when new eXML does not exist, it will create imroot folders, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, whether someone has already done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc, language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, the second we treat here."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"if you want to send us a question about this product, simply complete all the fields marked * and click" "Send". ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the Documentation Tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so somewhat:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = introduction.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the content directory is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but watch & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are certain that these are well and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you won't be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an email sending menu item such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, sending tool bars toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download it. the contributions will be checked and only available if our team needs them to be correct and useful for publication. to make a real contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for our team as well as for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the New Resource dialog you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start upload."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD File menus (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, examining & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signification. in case of problems warns it and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; but it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is selected as globally, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; stored. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"local elements represent a personal collection of web development funds for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that only this user can use it personally."</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to tool bars with special promotions especially for the files of a particular project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the EditorWindow, the building manhood, the boards with information and the tool bars. please strike in, and for more detailed information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the card leader with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, like closing the current, other or all card riders, recharge, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; pgt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box different fields."</seg>

<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"so this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3, could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" speech dispatcher "works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of screen readers has the highest priority. it will be withdrawn to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the Screen Reader is read, the stopped orders will be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>

<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. each order you want from the card card, is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text requests are meant for the output of longer texts that have no special urgency."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this output is stopped and terminated."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with predefined character strings like: -) by text, or for reformatting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form."</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to voice output. if the filter states that its rules are not applicable, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"when a text order, a message, warning or a notice; -notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters, which have been set up on the page. editing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to rebuild the band index file on the basis of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">"in this way, a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:"</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be found separately in the backup files. each entry is viewed from tar regardless of the others."</seg>

<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; gt; and lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted & codat; before the tape is integrated, the command loads load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed."</seg>

<seg id="2933">"if the option is turned on, it will automatically be discarded if the band is inserted; do not use this option with floppy Streamers."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"if the option is turned on, you are trying to change the hardwareseighty block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to share the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog enables users to access information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer does in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system stores the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"moreover, & ksystemlog enables users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some extended functions, with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, provides & ksystemlog; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, you are trying to open the system protocol, first of all, the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not show you, and it opens instead of its a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; you usually do not have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log folder for normal users."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion, or by typed strings."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter-search term will then only be compared with entries in the corresponding column. select for example in the log file system log the column process, and also apply in the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level Error are shown with a more striking color as protocol lines of level indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled in the setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display only a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command like e.g. for the start of the samba server. in this case, you can use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the pop-up context menu of the main window, to display all new added minutes lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol for displaying in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"to select the location of your project, just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location."</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; im & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the System V Init is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program start when running the system in the world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is below / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start using the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when doing the boot."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a little confused, then you can repair it by restarting the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will be invoked with the start argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to configure machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here, you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between running leveln or change the position within one level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are shifted if you move them into a new area. to only copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the Sortightnumber of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore records thrown in the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to enable the different workspaces (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, drag it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired running level with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting code or the name of an entry manually, press Enter key to open the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be saved by & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard runners, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press Enter key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for running Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE, or delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
