&quot; although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exce@@ ed@@ ingly great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , dancing American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Roberts , who wanted to occupy the su@@ preme court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he is dealing with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his view , he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women publicly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in crowds for him . &quot;
the 13 million votes he won at the Republi@@ can pres@@ idential election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic program that takes people from all over the world , a deep g@@ utter person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Tr@@ umps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung was not translated by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ umps In@@ tolerance is also contrary to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for their lives , and their husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
&quot; she still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bo@@ died by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump deci@@ ph@@ ered his way to nominated Republi@@ can pres@@ idential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ see these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as raci@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these vot@@ ers , most of them know , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comment@@ ates on the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( meaning of the Wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word game from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much as s@@ ling@@ shot ) , as it was the great Van Jones , did exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white America this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , say they . &quot;
&quot; in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; bro@@ o@@ ded the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a coher@@ ent and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

&quot; what happened to the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of Cat@@ eur@@ a ? &quot;
&quot; that music , which is played in both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among the tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) plays in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with gl@@ it@@ tering eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you will learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pani , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from ru@@ bb@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ vit@@ alized instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the Recy@@ c@@ ler began to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local environ@@ ment@@ alist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , reminds us of the early times : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something , which he had never seen before : a violin made of waste . &quot;
today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tonnes of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est , as the people in Cat@@ ail@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational acting from tr@@ ash music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ender of this species on their co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles swi@@ ft@@ ly mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ bours and refused to grant him a fishing licence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pl@@ under@@ ing fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa was founded : a network of countries to stop 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( illegal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like the same and work together . they exchange information and stand out where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is tra@@ pped is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while action against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the s@@ nail speed , with the information between individual countries , the actions now happen in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds very atten@@ tively the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , such suspic@@ ious driving routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship will charge its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay off punishment , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the so @-@ called platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishing , which penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive Th@@ un @-@ fish fish@@ eries which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also some illegal fishing fishermen .
&quot; their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license documents , stat@@ ing fantasy names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ completely organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You don &apos;t dar@@ ed to run my harbor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole , F@@ ISH @-@ i tries to close . &quot;
&quot; so far , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has exposed criminal networks that had spread f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found refuge ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing for long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which can no longer be ordered by satell@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really can influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened Oce@@ ana &apos;s Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine World Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able vessel can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project where a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that used to be fis@@ cated without a license and hardly expected to have consequences now know they are being observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after the help of F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , the insp@@ ectors were on board the tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually van@@ ish through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined forces to go to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . now they fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with certainty , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent Member State Somalia announced its first great triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still penet@@ rated into prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protect the oc@@ eans is actually working in the whole world of the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to spread to : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of conqu@@ ering the country &quot;

they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void , proce@@ eding on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central North @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country has deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the administration of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and profits are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on a large scale was considered the only way to give the country a chance to recon@@ quer its institutional structures and close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :

&quot; on Twitter pictures , which tell about arguments , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves beat the news about police re@@ pression in the central @-@ northern city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement . &quot;
&quot; hours later they left the cathedral safe , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear coats , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic map shows the magn@@ itude of re@@ pression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a term of administration , which was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road . &quot;

&quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis from its point of view , and has preferred to leave critical voices . &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches increasingly take on frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of C@@ ór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now told Qui@@ j@@ ano as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated crimes perpet@@ rated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of his family secret .
in the situation at that time I believed that this was OK .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ tur@@ er and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor who was accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who before a Federal Court pronounced against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
they all called it &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass only on , that they will not take you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would become a secret agent .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation , I thought that would be fine . &quot;
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prison@@ er . &quot;
&quot; all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance of the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little pack wrapped in a blank@@ et and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were abandoned and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; since then , the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &quot;
I saw in and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
&quot; later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable , and the other end was fixed to the body of the person who was tied up there . &quot;
&quot; they rarely le@@ ak a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ase him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one person can do so much suffering to another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied and tied with cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance guar@@ ded people sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prison@@ er , he said , &quot; &quot; Why do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; Why did you otherwise bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survi@@ vors of the civilian is Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the leader of La Per@@ la Memorial , goes through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you entered here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be transferred . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &quot; war@@ ri@@ ors &quot;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ nings &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , - I was in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military badge , which one takes against an enemy that has been fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war @-@ yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the head of the security forces , could contribute to this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; You , who sa@@ iled cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we do not need anyone else !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ out pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ scientious obj@@ ector in this crime . I rep@@ lied , not a problem , they can put my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testi@@ fy .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
why kid@@ n@@ apping children ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could simply have put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families to whom one could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crus@@ hed and somewhere dispos@@ ed - no idea where . &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked me what the whole ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he only rep@@ lied &quot; &quot; Na then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 2010 I replaced the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I finally said against my own father .

the jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in the Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 581 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and in 28 cases the court suspended sentences of sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ Rating : murder , torture and ra@@ pe by officers . # Es@@ War@@ state terrorism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kid@@ n@@ apped with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the judgment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were mur@@ dered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government transferred the country to La Per@@ la so that there was a memorial to be erected there , which is now run by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Ky@@ oto &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation mistake at a center in Ky@@ oto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was circul@@ ated in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s license , witnessed a very un@@ successful translation last month . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word was written on a shield , which means &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; , &quot; mistakenly - but also with malicious back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to read electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
&quot; adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n &apos;s daily newspaper Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto just un@@ acceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; V drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto was ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast news spread somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved in the country far in accidents , is quite a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Ky@@ oto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents caused by sen@@ iors were caused by a total of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the author , which was not named , brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently do against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a true translation mistake . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate them , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ckr users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ any staff with English as a native language , which might produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translat@@ ing , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have foreign employees , can make translations available in the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English language is considered to be the best , is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ckr users Karl Baron .
automated translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the pro@@ voc@@ ative and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique can still not replace human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints which often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for stylis@@ tic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ckr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government which have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Ky@@ oto will hopefully use a serious source of translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protest and protest actions on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded the protests of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by op@@ position@@ ist groups , who contra@@ dict the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was ti@@ pped , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it appears that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again closed .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant since 2014 when reporting protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and lo@@ ckers if they would continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond correctly to certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will reply to errors or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; you might want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , was dis@@ closed on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ a@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in police cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
he was released eight hours later and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making access to multimedia reports on current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an appren@@ tic@@ eship . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies of other cri@@ adi@@ tas , which were the same as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a review by Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one who has become something &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her minor son or her minor daughter to another , more prosper@@ ous family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that you can &apos;t lift up . &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ o@@ bis - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ c@@ ta is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that she can ab@@ stain from her education , improve her position in society , and can &quot; &quot; make something out of himself &quot; &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with her , justi@@ fies the exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never get out of them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which occurs in secret in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed tracks of violent blow@@ s . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply involved in the practice of the crimes committed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta sentenced to 30 years in prison .
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be ground@@ breaking - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ c@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when her father worked in her father to sign up bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and lost her father &apos;s work .
&quot; their brothers had to work now and began selling cand@@ y on the street or on the market , in order to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as a cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn . &quot;
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she was finished with learning , the more leisure she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get an unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the household library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ bel , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the Ste@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read articles of opposition articles such as &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade her to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator regime . &quot;
&quot; he held them intellig@@ ently , but did not inter@@ rupt with her . &quot; &quot; the ste@@ ward had found someone who listened as he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would be &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose , explains . &quot;
&quot; however , she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ bbing and the chic@@ anes , which are exposed to cri@@ adi@@ tas , when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertis@@ ements for clean@@ ers and children in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please register .
starting from Monday if possible .
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a five @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by also offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad shi@@ fted again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I just look if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ log to the report of Cri@@ o@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ c@@ ta , for how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish con@@ quer@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , were ens@@ la@@ ved by the Spanish con@@ quer@@ ors and their &quot; wives &quot; ) . &quot;

bill stipul@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
six@@ ty Egyptian parliament members recently voted on a bill to &quot; regulate the regulations concerning the use and utility of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up in order to use citizens &apos; permission to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ ph@@ s and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running and used over the internet to communicate with others by voice , video chess and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is assumed , as the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , member of parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications agency , to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to it , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not so far known that such plans exist .
experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control both physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to supply them to a court case . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with legislative elections and constitutional committees before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y legislat@@ ing proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the veter@@ an H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub @-@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ icol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on the fact that a large pre@@ dat@@ or exists . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see an Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera field , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , which was responsible for the Nor@@ theast Japan , has been reporting the progress made in the last six years in order to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple cat@@ astrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to attack , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared entire coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture already experienced a nuclear accident , already alone for that reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from the local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years after , in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , one still tries to settle for six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of dwelling @-@ homes ( bar@@ gains , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to final spare @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people living in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ ac@@ uation in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had been more successful . more than 75 percent of ev@@ ac@@ uation in homes were moved into final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent here .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have res@@ umed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of ag@@ r@@ arian land , have been sever@@ ely affected . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 ac@@ res of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear block@@ age zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , however , can only have 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of those ques@@ tioned that still not enough has been done in disaster prevention . &quot;
as it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused their attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replac@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; after the stand of 2017 , still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation companies , who are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ Accomodation hausen , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . this is part of the Olympics which are part of the Olympic Games that are scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey A@@ you@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana had struck him with a bat@@ on against the head . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered to be critical .
&quot; the local artist journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the completion of the investigation into the incident . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officer , as he suggests going to Go@@ i@@ ana with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be watching television for six months and the entire re@@ pression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , distributed the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several hospitals shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10.000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;

separ@@ ati@@ sts
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was brutal police force against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber sho@@ ots and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ un@@ ce viol@@ ators on violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media stre@@ aked street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paolo were specifically reported about a broken glass window in order to illustrate their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journalist reason to report more about a broken window plate than over the protests of thousands of people , who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
you also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ induced Vill@@ ages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane producers in all Cuba joined the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane producers .
&quot; after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region and the factory lost after and after its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ ign and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls precisely that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced volumes . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest is no more news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane producers were technically de@@ prec@@ ated , and hardly competitive were they un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
&quot; however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per po@@ und , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane producers , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most often is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was an official written document , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ lis@@ es Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was ex@@ or@@ ted and the letters became more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job generator has been eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ places and services that the plants generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut Speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar cane producers
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich lear@@ nt that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to inter@@ fere , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ es other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they have been delivered to spare parts .
&quot; without a perspective of the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve to supply the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine crops give the old soldiers a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month , to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ vers@@ ing person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that you told him not . &quot;
they have been tor@@ ting him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes back with 65 years in pensions , not because it l@@ acks strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

first Nations young@@ sters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do they by hip @-@ hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , a workshop leader has been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres for youth groups to bring song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and collabor@@ ated in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop increases with the fact that the young participants in conversation issues like &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ math First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a section in West Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chorus is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
that is the day you will consume our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and likewise advance our youth
&quot; thus , they can do what they intended for the Creator . &quot;
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he to Sil@@ verb@@ ank ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; table tennis courts ( in @-@ house , in @-@ house ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers are looking at these plastic courts and then decide whether to enter or pass the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic meals .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that produce even those plastic courts that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually so common that they do not even attract them anymore . however , a new trend is turned into striking mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in the special sale : new with plastic cards decorated cell@@ phone bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of food orders is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an Kais@@ a @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl we found a good use as a cell phone stand .
also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some handy and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , I@@ K@@ UR@@ A or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts may also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example colleagues or family members to surprise un@@ pleas@@ antly . &quot;
our latest phone @-@ stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; we also offer rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;

&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry , for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;

a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ i@@ ckers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ i@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico the mis@@ er@@ ci@@ sts and killed are regularly reflected in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human trage@@ dy that this struggle brings with itself . &quot;
&quot; the report on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every skel@@ eton in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; learning with drug traff@@ i@@ cking &quot; &quot; ) that is to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were killed in the battle between criminal prosec@@ ution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ i@@ ckers , and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ j@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for every weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today to seek out and to search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but it does not get them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we come from ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures that can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is contra@@ sting or sad . it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent to this or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year c@@ ous@@ in thinks that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ i@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who fear that they have happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ action of people is unbeliev@@ able for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village justified them that they were &quot; shallow . &quot; &quot;
I think they try to persu@@ ade that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies unless they are stir@@ ring and still .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ Distri@@ cts , &quot; as a family with threats has been pill@@ aged . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never goes wrong , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kid@@ n@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I wonder@@ ed whether wines would dis@@ solve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , pot@@ ted potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , saw the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the number of mur@@ ders for public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average of 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate them into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those that we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ i@@ cking in the last four decades . &quot;

the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a f@@ ake .
&quot; but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copy of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample di@@ ligent coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ car crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the lor@@ ries fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; representatives of the authorities described a Fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses wrapped up including a cinema in the vicinity that was full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and carbon@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ ably .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the img@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ated bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly w@@ ron@@ ged real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a people to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be shown figur@@ atively .
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting orders for Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example fal@@ sely w@@ ron@@ ged the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were blow@@ s , ra@@ pe and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following ones reported these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an acid Arab news page , which mistakenly claimed that President Burma &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein had said , mon@@ k and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to survey this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but did not imp@@ ly the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of this false coupling extend back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; revers@@ ed picture search , &quot; you can see how far information limits can be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the pic@@ tured image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mass of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered some examples of mis@@ use and linked them with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the listed countries ( which were also linked together in some cases ) , several examples of mis@@ use can come from . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be completely flus@@ hed ( on the card in orange ) :

&quot; this news page w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was admitted in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; the article has been updated in 2014 and , at the time of publication , the picture is still included in it . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture does not origin@@ ate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation in the context of the massac@@ re of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the massac@@ re of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam in the name of Islam .
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence for the massac@@ re of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massac@@ re , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it fal@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; from the emb@@ assy in which the image from the DR Congo was contained , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye points out but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Musli@@ u . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regards to major discussions about silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are ambitious people who acci@@ dentally have a share of drinking water around a trage@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; the mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the actual horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been discussed in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that with@@ holding images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the trage@@ dy . sometimes , these pictures are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and give them the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( for example , this study which examined how violent media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; f@@ ake news . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from the context or in a completely ab@@ ble way . &quot;
&quot; however , each study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; blog un@@ vei@@ ls the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ translat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) endeav@@ ours to offer language inspired a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; &quot; un@@ translat@@ able &quot; &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu like : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k - Get your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having heated up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal different thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish even more of these &quot; &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are greatly appreciated by translat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding cat@@ astrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ d@@ water and earthquake disaster in this decade .
&quot; the mon@@ soon , which normally sett@@ les at the end of May , has entered the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disa@@ stro@@ us centre of Sri Lanka dated 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud law@@ n@@ ines . &quot;
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 secure places of residence . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
&quot; high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7,5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to flood @-@ water situation . &quot;
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever , war@@ ns Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today tomorrow the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water peg@@ s of Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force made five planes for rescue operations and another five are made for transpor@@ ting emergency supplies for the inhabitants of their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and food @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ ore centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the Trop@@ en@@ crash Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwar@@ ded free to the Sri R@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue activities for people with floo@@ ds and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and civilian population Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of safety and provide relief measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , and the Sri L@@ ank@@ as population is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March 21st January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she confi@@ ded to me her children ; she is my rock in br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next draft we apply per@@ missions to trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ ill@@ fully explo@@ de slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in their conception . &quot;
they com@@ mis@@ ses me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim @-@ drawer . &quot;
&quot; in our collective conception , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are mis@@ led . &quot;
un@@ com@@ mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this is even happening to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim minister and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Kor@@ an , and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images also rise further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female pres@@ idential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forced Saudi women to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exer@@ ts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong N@@ arr@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has so profound and fla@@ w@@ ed our collective imagination , that often Si@@ kh &apos;s men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
1.7 billion are part of the
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives which help us to understand the world .
and my industry is fab@@ ul@@ ously pushed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed to see where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America at the highest level . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ sto@@ y Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
approved .
&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then when Khan was re@@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were uns@@ killed Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ circum@@ cised Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chiefs who wear all Muslims - &quot; &quot; Resp@@ ect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ ok@@ er , we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widely spread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who runs the head@@ scarf to a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the US , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ liest forms reaches our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and multi@@ fac@@ eted that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;
the author 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
approved .
I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but being a Muslim , was born into my imagination only when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I hold her in my arms and whis@@ pers the Arabic verses for protection that seal the Kor@@ an and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
the grand@@ mother of the author when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal with their sisters ; like decades ago they won a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that at this moment I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers she had said to me when I have a bad day .
&quot; being Muslims , as they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ He , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that - over the centuries - has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable British East In@@ dies , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grand@@ father .
approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ pt s@@ ore around his family in India dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , family , whom he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all to be &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first F@@ LI@@ E@@ GER@@ BO@@ MB@@ E of history was rejected by a Muslim country over a century ago .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ aching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ finished history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops deployed across every continent apart from Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the su@@ icide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a trage@@ dy bears the USA and the susp@@ ect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into that country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple lines , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a cube , but is represented in the reducing second &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and exp@@ elled under President Obama . &quot;
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries which bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; that largely refers to Arab@@ s and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we are leading , and the bom@@ bs we throw at Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those that we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University demonstrated a scienti@@ fically correct picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with respect to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the sli@@ ght@@ est score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image of expression that we present in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multip@@ ly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global date in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for con@@ spiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they grew expon@@ enti@@ ally because they did Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history that I wasn &apos;t aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but that made me an un@@ changing Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread cr@@ umb track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections which our humanity makes , there may be a story where one is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation took place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islamic Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be brought and people were enth@@ r@@ alled by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago even scientific by Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to give ourselves un@@ comfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girl@@ friend and I put in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , as he already vom@@ ited a new future in which we have no president who bom@@ bs the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; stor@@ yt@@ elling , by Fli@@ ckr users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the lingu@@ istic diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project applies :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces , in which residents must not forget who they are , to belong . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with understanding , these events &quot; instead &quot; listen to &quot; the listening to appreciate , to make sense . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers presented their story first in their own language and then translate them into English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devot@@ ion and their presentation will cause the audience to listen to it . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the speech of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of stor@@ yt@@ elling for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after expla@@ ining the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ elling performances . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re@@ define state debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Ang@@ li@@ can Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
&quot; it was proclaimed by the group &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( ci@@ vic front for the re @-@ examination of the deb@@ ts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of re@@ affir@@ mation of the debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , banks and government agencies responsible for deb@@ ts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without any personal interest in public deb@@ ts , with a fixed , working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that is organised in Berlin , was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , published books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom ) . &quot;
the book published last year and licensed here is a series of articles that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built , and what are the real costs associated with it . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ a@@ ined in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was deleted from the A@@ dra prison &apos;s directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice , who push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in det@@ ention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; b@@ ass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and brought it into knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , b@@ ass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry thre@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes was more predic@@ table than the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , em@@ bo@@ dying this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this stri@@ pe into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a newspaper capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , sharing his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he has taught other det@@ a@@ inees to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other det@@ a@@ inees as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
&quot; she s@@ mu@@ g@@ ged the lyrics to him , when she visited him , and he translated it from the Arabic to English . &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
envel@@ ope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that each of the haz@@ ards does not matter to me
&quot; everybody of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards &quot;
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with my passion
when your eyes are f@@ are@@ well
and I want another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ .000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption , director after release returned to previous post &quot;
&quot; with anger , MO@@ TI@@ BI@@ K@@ AN@@ ER re@@ acted with anger for corruption , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funding from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19th . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic which rejected the motion , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to its old post , as the company did not accomplish any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not call the action good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly CIP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the CIP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the re@@ fut@@ ation .
&quot; the company seems to be silent , however , and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had hal@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ lied &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bit@@ on Vi@@ age , young MO@@ TI@@ BI@@ K@@ AN@@ ER and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he offen@@ ded him , I can not believe that one is rewarded in such a way that has already ins@@ ul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za l@@ acks mor@@ ality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only served by the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state when dealing with an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ us preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to recall that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are part of the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , which will not only be remembered for the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans as a first independent president but also as sharp , single @-@ cutting and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed energetic that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he sat down for 10 years and came free .
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
Emil@@ y Sam@@ bo of the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) states that crime in Moz@@ ambi@@ que pays off :

Facebook blocks the ra@@ cial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or duc@@ ts .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attribution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ por@@ ted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ores the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ ject con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly uses Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically invo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts , for purposes of his use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair in Bur@@ m@@ ically is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( column ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Facebook User A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they knew how to rel@@ ieve his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ acks believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needed to be more analy@@ tic before rele@@ asing all posts that were suspected of rac@@ ism in the suspic@@ ion . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ ls the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ e@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words .
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spread the hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply begin using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
&quot; when I was aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
ens@@ hr@@ ing such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
it also seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a huge turnover , it would be great . &quot;
• Fac@@ ebooks Auto c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship provided users with lots of mo@@ ck@@ ery .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat a pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
only to try out whether Facebook is the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says , If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is said to hei@@ gh@@ ten the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of refugees . &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to take control of the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of simply c@@ ens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running rather than focusing on context rather than code concentr@@ ating initiatives and lear@@ nt from them . &quot;

the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country un@@ anim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age of marriage is at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , said to be a group representing the various religious groups of the country that the state should not inter@@ fere , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the Min@@ ors as , , every person under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Central Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married among 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were stri@@ ving to abol@@ ish laws for chil@@ d@@ birth followed at the feet and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the cri@@ tic of the children , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition ensured ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s to@@ e - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law procla@@ im .

Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not a single one against it .
&quot; after he was previously agreed in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws of the pa@@ edi@@ atric ward were finally changed . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was minist@@ ering a minist@@ erial post at the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has used too much time and unnecessary talk that has conce@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago and that is almost every price . &quot;

&quot; the draft plan for the change of the married couple was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
at the House of Represent@@ atives there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 were present at the voting .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were admitted have voted for the law .

&quot; however , a potential h@@ itch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announces his intention to take judicial action , the law should be passed and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wants to proceed against the law , most social media users wish to approach the debate on the subject otherwise . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that can only give rise to panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of the problem , would say that the state , our daughters prevent them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men who are opposed to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws which they under@@ line . &quot;

&quot; for over a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
&quot; although many technology @-@ sealed Internet users are used to use revers@@ ing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has recently blocked articles from Wikipedia , recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 take place after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the inter@@ planetary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which does not support domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult . &quot;

&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to lay snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to look at at least any Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;

one acc@@ esses a different URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; basically , the server runs the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
&quot; Su@@ h@@ len@@ des Nas@@ horn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around himself . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and well @-@ washed colours . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animal world to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , gives it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook like this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the border of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just returned home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that was a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to bend images ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like .
&quot; and he ought to know , for he was standing before face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b himself from the opinion of the sheep by sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ si@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for fo@@ stering N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of ad@@ ders . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;
see below some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands &quot;

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ aa@@ z K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a Content Sh@@ aring Agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands , or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , and the fear of the consequences should uph@@ old the norm in keeping this practice alive . &quot;
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was con@@ vic@@ ted from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having contacted a married relatives .
&quot; the tradition of their wives also is not common in the name , is also widespread among men . however , they have far less embarrass@@ ment to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main focus of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club . &quot;
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion rounds , acted by women who call her hus@@ bands not by name . &quot;
she chose this issue because she wanted to open up the discussion of the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify .
&quot; to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud , is a custom that they all maintain compulsory and have never ques@@ tioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not consider this is considered to be dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband never named her name , wanted to try at home as it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
botan@@ ic represent@@ ations
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the lap Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to take the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does this mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about crus@@ hing a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
botan@@ ic represent@@ ations
&quot; a woman was so timi@@ d that , during the whole exercise , she had only ki@@ cked himself off ; another decided to let out all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in ad@@ ren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try home to name their hus@@ bands in their name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed she got afraid , and said it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead , indicating the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ d point if he did . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women did not quit altogether , but think that they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each point of discussion . &quot;
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out to the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never really talked about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ sa @-@ Kur@@ a , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes choice , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , botan@@ ically linked their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans , and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether something changed in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
so far we have only made little steps .
&quot; some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their foreh@@ ead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rus@@ hing of more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate flow .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reports about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan tour of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans inter@@ changed memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , commented on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language , &quot; Ry@@ ui@@ chi Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese central schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot;
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places connected with the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , you are your 5 places that you must definitely visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry F@@ ields ( memorial in New York )
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&quot; 5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizar@@ re enough :
d@@ Ra@@ CI@@ D@@ 01
today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
&quot; right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year .
&quot; and of course some companies also use the fan base compar@@ atively , like this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; today I &apos;m going to listen to &quot; &quot; Today &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot;
this is how the day will pass .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;

&quot; a new system of the kid@@ n@@ apping of G@@ lat@@ z@@ kö@@ p@@ enden people for organ trading , probably for non @-@ believers , wor@@ ries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were taken out .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a member of a G@@ lat@@ z@@ kö@@ p@@ enden man could bring gold or fortune , explained the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on smo@@ other men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with Al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 to carry out a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice .
&quot; persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya resi@@ des in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are target ritual attacks , the Moz@@ amb@@ ican police warned about the latest kill@@ ings of three G@@ lat@@ z@@ kö@@ p@@ enden men because of their body parts . &quot;
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ek where the kill@@ ings took place .
&quot; Hus@@ torn Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police already follow the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the G@@ lat@@ z@@ kö@@ ping men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of G@@ lat@@ z@@ kö@@ p@@ enden individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power to recover the riches . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were mur@@ dered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE G@@ ERNE E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE SI@@ CH ashamed a country where people would have shame on going to the streets , and other services , a nation in which people would not hurt men or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor car@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted , which aim to achieve rapid wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our . &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn around him and speak our deep sympathy towards his family , friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ tille &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people who were spending himself as an in@@ sider of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; the residence and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we pay tribute to the creation of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of open web @-@ movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations who have been campaign@@ ing for his release over the past five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ .000 people have disappeared , so the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime , or violent , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the fall of the im@@ pris@@ oned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o drew attention in the international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital because of liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he had taken part in the draft of the Ch@@ arta 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and nar@@ rated a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him to treat abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have cri@@ tici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man refused , however , to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told us that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon trip to China , as the exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed its hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision taken by China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift up all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. amb@@ assador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with the fact that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; speaking in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , the news agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities should not only release Li@@ u , but also release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the promp@@ ting of the US Embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry , that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and un@@ answer@@ able comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the following : &quot;
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also instit@@ uted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns , whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called China to provide adequate medical care and to give it the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s attor@@ ney told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room at the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and establish contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um goes on :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including free speech , and to fre@@ eze interven@@ ing rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
French Foreign Ministry demanded China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news transmitter France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France would eventually receive it . &quot;
Tai@@ pei
&quot; the Council of the Embassy in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u , and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislat@@ ure Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be dealt with in Taiwan .
Hol@@ iness the Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 um Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and was sever@@ ely pun@@ ished for which he had been sever@@ ely pun@@ ished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stup@@ id as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports Singapore to be considered as a city .
... no one ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people mistake a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one h@@ ears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of this , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities which are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the nucle@@ us of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the distor@@ ted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final effect the recent weeks of Shan@@ mu@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he also disgu@@ ised relevant questions with Non @-@ Ans@@ wers of rational Art .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng requests Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our town ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the reviews that one should start reading the entire head@@ line of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the co@@ dex .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ even , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these towns saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam as leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he truly believes it is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review ki@@ cks off the weak@@ nesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams reason@@ ing :
did Mr Shan@@ mu@@ gam have committed a mistake ? or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ?
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore pay their military service , but do they not defend their city ? &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to affir@@ m , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .

screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a series of progress , reve@@ aling rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry I am sorry . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; in my clari@@ fication , the default response usually follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook pres@@ um@@ ably against anger if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that diff@@ ers Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le@@ leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it would not matter if you would change me , for example , Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ic@@ acious - like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
be harm@@ less means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that pass around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main characteristic of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just chil@@ ly pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ deau also entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band released in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , which took the power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girl@@ friend makes .
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently followed over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ic section 44 of the provis@@ ional constitution , which gives an absolute decision to the commander of the army on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; change @-@ in &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered to be a cri@@ tic by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors the online content and persons accused of having been accused of having been persec@@ uted , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand establis@@ hes a strict har@@ ming against &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was declared in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the issues that Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into a det@@ ention camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they suppos@@ edly caused &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs became members of the band , who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russi@@ ans , Greeks , de@@ al@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today the biggest part of Russi@@ ans and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; more than 10,000 people lived here in the pre @-@ war period . today there are only a few hundred people in these host@@ ages . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43@@ .000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ty@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately retreat . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us that we let ourselves be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for special needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the l@@ aps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ te &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave from Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial assistance from her daughter , and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead . &quot;
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if vac@@ ations are , we visit . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a recent neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; says T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone ) , they had not had the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; she says rever@@ ently . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation first when many people left the village after the war .
&quot; but over time , she lost her anxiety . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , however , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; every day , I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
&quot; as our conversation en@@ vy the end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then rolls down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the lost buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ ti@@ ght@@ ness in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken has been published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 and is published here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mex@@ ic@@ ans , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ gestell and golden earrings in Teddy B@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , she knows many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
there is a par@@ rots in a cage in the anter@@ oom .
there is no sign for the hotel - there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you from Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she does not want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medications that they cannot pay , she mass@@ ages them with a bal@@ m that drew from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa is a fair nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
Foto : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil already , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans already speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to welcome her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she declar@@ es that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chi@@ ckens like Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken up migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ in@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ mail@@ ed money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ in @-@ one , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , the travelers check their teleph@@ ones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ sters that she made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; at the same time , a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which they instruc@@ ted the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police notified that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terr@@ orists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remote control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers able to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region .
&quot; while noti@@ fying digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and the South , the reality is often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme z@@ ens@@ ers and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ down@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the media outlets based on Twitter , published on Twitter , published the zen@@ ry news in China , showed photos of a checkpoint where polic@@ emen ass@@ aul@@ ted the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected in a Check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be im@@ pris@@ oned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by means of rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ o China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; images from BAU China &quot; &quot; has published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which empha@@ sizes that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus ob@@ tains unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of cy@@ ber security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report from Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued a regulation to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , lap@@ tops and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; Sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experience in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes its name all honor .
one who has kno@@ cked down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality cat@@ ches you again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the play , the beautiful scenes and the performers - transform the characters into being made of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth moves on the axis of evil . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them have built your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of Security Wor@@ ship formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destro@@ ying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
&quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all neighbor@@ hoods were co@@ vet@@ ed , but not my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , un@@ ra@@ iny , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been as@@ leep to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply was stopped in the district . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice heard through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we were united to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you have sh@@ elled them all the way up to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts saying : &quot; &quot; let me hear what you cry &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry out , if we are not near . &quot;
his eyes @-@ filled eyes focused on me .
and you mo@@ urn what to look into my eyes and not on the floor !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my cause when I rep@@ lied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never ce@@ ased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father alike . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed pro@@ position is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months . &quot;
I step@@ ped through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then back through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I give all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one other prison@@ er , and I must immediately sit , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes felt like a whole life , the function@@ ary left the cell , and I walked back to an old proven method of communication : to beat the wall with the f@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ de was a &quot; &quot; help &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a resp@@ ectable middle aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no mark@@ ers can be recognized by me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my voice ?
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will listen immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator assured me , they would leave him if I remain . &quot;
li@@ dd@@ y@@ 1@@ 180
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to exp@@ el all those crow@@ s that refres@@ h themselves in the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear it &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about ten o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the scre@@ ams sound every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th sur@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from acqu@@ iring the tra@@ itors and terr@@ orists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ive him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these days and protest against demonstrations , which will soon come to an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and blow@@ s have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to pun@@ ish myself , or badly , even though I had nothing done to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will look at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ am didn &apos;t get enough to him yet , which is why they inter@@ changed the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector sooner or if it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed four cables in order to present us the great invention of a giant cable , from their point of view . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them altern@@ ate as I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my entire body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours passed , which came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ass@@ fu@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive youth , &quot; &quot; My Lord , my father has to worry about fear@@ ful sorrow . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoking a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indo@@ ors ; sometimes he hin@@ ders to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can leave is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his lips @-@ spot@@ ted lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and asks their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and ra@@ pe music . &quot;
&quot; with his music which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special inc@@ lin@@ ation against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a human being &quot; &quot; while in water dissolved N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sel@@ ess hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the Schl@@ ücke lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the Kent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if you take a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an Water - in order not to land in j@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior of Jord@@ ani@@ ens announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual Fron@@ ts@@ än@@ gers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and the main reason for the concert speech . &quot;
the MP and former spokes@@ person of the Islamic Co@@ alition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ tivis@@ m , which represents the well @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who still op@@ ted for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might not be simply shallow rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact reflected increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b recovered traditional gender nor@@ ms by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently stun@@ ted unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; volunteers &quot; &quot; took place in Jordan - the un@@ official out@@ war@@ dly left . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still more difficult that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder mur@@ ders or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; det@@ a@@ ined inde@@ fin@@ itely in prison , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucr@@ atic effort , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; even H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues , which in his country were long as t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he adm@@ its that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit alle@@ g@@ ations on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attack the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and every one is also . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ ei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were heavily ens@@ ored until in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Ro@@ ya j@@ ord@@ an online program to remember that his comments were torn out of context , distor@@ ted and his views were c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is adverti@@ sed openly for the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ da , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory even today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asked himself : if Abu Nu@@ del , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ es , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ eer not that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian mess@@ enger assumed several former government members and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they have cri@@ tically expressed themselves on comments in social media cri@@ tically related to the problems associated with the deep @-@ rooted corruption . &quot;
&quot; in light of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s , even from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will open up with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , aspir@@ ation and artificial cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the for@@ ts , drums and dancing have been handed over for more than one thousand years , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region that force emissions to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is hard to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drugs are common@@ place . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region feel not safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru experienced - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , which can form these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts meet each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ cent@@ ric looks like you can see in the following video ( further videos to current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in hair art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work . &quot;
dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special educational workshops before the school year commen@@ cing in March and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community for love with the children . &quot;

this is precisely the question of the two young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) that encourages young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; recently her land was a scene of a historical event , and they wanted to help her part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa de@@ fle@@ ction F@@ ARC , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Colum@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ il@@ la@@ k@@ fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carrying their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , who had become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colum@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that is exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - messages sent to former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - who should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an Inspiration for the Camp@@ a@@ ign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the United Nations camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students at Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves as they had previously done to receive the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive instructions , but letters of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbeliev@@ able how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the student assistant Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a colleague of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior carried me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed lay a m@@ gl @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the sleeping bag . &quot;
&quot; and I answered him , saying , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful to me , so I answer &quot; . &quot; I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ es .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry , too , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were joined to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all raised up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in sec@@ rec@@ y .
&quot; so the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magn@@ itude it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never heard their hearing and had no voting right , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their habit@@ ats and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former war@@ ri@@ ors have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colum@@ bian was proof that peace would rule after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to sei@@ ze arms and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hang@@ s like a D@@ amo@@ is compla@@ in@@ ant about the local L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic .
&quot; the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports published which addressed the de@@ preci@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ az@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspic@@ ious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; even since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ung had experienced of the gender settlement of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
she moved out of fear for her life last En@@ des to the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a voluntary hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
&quot; one day , I was told that someone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ wife who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents went through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was there to bring out some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up last end in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : what medical wings have you been put in - in men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neigh@@ bors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I have to prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just evil and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have particle size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a numer@@ ical plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was prosec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ beli@@ vable . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and thre@@ w her into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you are in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know which hotel you are about . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this actually was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , that is a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still carry in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I am actually trying to look like the person to which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had im@@ pris@@ oned in ar@@ cane one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an no man were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; with this I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has been experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says that there were not so many .
&quot; if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to judge Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terr@@ orists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately under@@ went to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote somebody who was im@@ pris@@ oned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself , when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to s@@ have ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people , which belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , took place in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
I had a Bob in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already known in quite Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was true , I had never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me just a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; there is a saying in the Che@@ chen language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
you often say it to children if they make fun of sick people .
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off before you , because they believed you were ill ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov appeared on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television over mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating . &quot;
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the United States .
&quot; apart from that , I still work as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for this .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped the type of refuge .
I am Muslims and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : are you wearing a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know you with foam before mouth , that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the ro@@ dents have what the Cab@@ ard@@ ans have , which Russi@@ ans have ; on the whole planet there are them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it &apos;s the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I &apos;m going to be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in su@@ ici@@ des within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in su@@ ici@@ des . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani Hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all the fathers of the family , who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable of pursuing their families because of persecution on the part of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , located in the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi mon@@ archy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to complete ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population gains only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victim of untreated disease , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arab@@ s systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territory where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish@@ - and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ ks young now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at exter@@ min@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mi , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist , resi@@ ding in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ists emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recru@@ itment process .
&quot; since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at exter@@ min@@ ating the spirit of national resistance by young Arab@@ s , forcing them to make their living outside their hom@@ etown A@@ ha@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be so employed , as even Arab names at the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to end@@ ure , human rights activists see alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

why I do not identify with femin@@ ism even with inter@@ sec@@ tional ?

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the statement , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even think well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I get to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my master &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a two @-@ fold manner . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk with migration background , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuse to consider inj@@ us@@ tices in her thinking , which relate to the sex as well as the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ istic sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human being in a historical sense and is mar@@ gin@@ alised . &quot;
&quot; I allow myself to join groups who also absor@@ b our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to close white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and sex . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different proven@@ ance a home and cut off from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to rid myself of femin@@ ism and to join the movement of wh@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ourselves , says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are totally safe and where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed that the black woman constitutes . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion once they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement from which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can raise black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradig@@ m . &quot;
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life has neither fig@@ ured , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; Nab@@ il Mus@@ a repeatedly travel@@ ed in the past seven years - mostly with surf@@ board or in can@@ oe , with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based document@@ aries and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on persec@@ uted , poor@@ ly noted sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help oppressed churches can tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Violence Aga@@ inst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Elec@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # past@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the people affected .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent to her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time had passed and the police said her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , she also took advantage of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s expert ad . &quot;
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women give advertis@@ ements at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be registered at the prosec@@ ution authorities . &quot;
&quot; Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
the available numbers are al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace . also here , 86 % of the ads of women came . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; on any woman who ref@@ uses Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; explained them at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s commit in Paraguay is not a separate sentence , the prosec@@ ution authorities cannot sufficiently document how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists reported at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men . &quot;

invisible mal@@ treatment and a judicial system that does not accept nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she decided . this should always regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she carried out psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I never thought I would become victims of mi@@ stre@@ atment .
&quot; when I read about it before , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ missive because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ atment of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had dropped the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain amount of inno@@ c@@ ence .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated her . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; ) which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ atment .
&quot; finally , her weal@@ thy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities stayed without any result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was primarily concerned with money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for you ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ dom to an independent off@@ ense and pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighboring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also raise the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is generally prohibited , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill of legislation fores@@ een most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proced@@ ural cost that the victims of violence have to wear at present themselves , if they simply furnis@@ h an indication and would like to receive a secure accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislat@@ ure does not provide sufficient funding for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts , take responsibility and contribute to the perpet@@ r@@ ators of the perpet@@ r@@ ators . &quot;
we must allow such a long indication until mis@@ handling is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims again .
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media held in Oman a year after the ban on a newspaper is still exposed to attacks
&quot; this website was closed on the website of the For@@ bidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later came free again . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dism@@ is@@ sed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the sole sult@@ an , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sult@@ an &apos;s reign is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the sec@@ rec@@ y intelligence , public freedom , including press freedom , including press freedom , to restri@@ ct and im@@ prison human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically advoc@@ ate peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its formation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was b@@ anned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article titled &quot; High Pri@@ ority Groups joining hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the paper on July 26 , 2016 . it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman . &quot;
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking fac@@ tions involve hands of justice . &quot;
Facebook : https : / / www.facebook.com / pages / Ka@@ Blu@@ b@@ ber / 48@@ 37@@ 400@@ 0@@ 169@@ 110@@ 3
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , he was a member of the editorial committee , invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , ISS confirmed the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed inde@@ fin@@ itely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper was prohibited on any road , including online , starting on 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in M@@ ask@@ at in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the paper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , because of distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a publication ban and the s@@ lander . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ an@@ ic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damages deposit of 5000 om@@ ani giant ( 13 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court openly pronounced Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister was once again opposed to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated recently in Oman .
&quot; further violations include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , is calling on the Georgi@@ an authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
&quot; 2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect press freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman are un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ al measures , including judicial har@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent states through the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to assemble , support and shelter them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on @-@ site : there are a lack of medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is undertaken by African scientists , helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Research of Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he even resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the sam@@ bal health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bal national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; I also star@@ ed a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GV : what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain benef@@ ici@@ aries , rather than being makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
Q : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and ac@@ adem@@ ics in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa vis @-@ à @-@ vis Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system means that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the US since the 1980s .
&quot; its company has 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was confin@@ ed only by its own imagination and the question of how many Sal@@ at@@ ines can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
&quot; patents are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red@@ - or green tone or ru@@ ff@@ led leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card varieties . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food safety for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on still bre@@ eds salad , but he now needs longer , because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oulder is lying around which I must treat .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they resist court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very cau@@ tious and stri@@ ves to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the US and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of grade Out@@ red@@ ded in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .
photo : NA@@ SA
it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to be able to freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders do only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow them - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding views
&quot; for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in greater contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty , without sovereignty , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to keep others freely available to others , as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is always available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are not such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Question of View@@ ing
plants are so discipl@@ ined that they have specifically desired characteristics - from such by which their taste or colour improves to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decre@@ asing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more unnecessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ table by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to Spe@@ ech@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto ack@@ now@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property is owned by other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties &quot; innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not in@@ hi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent lasts , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if one has to wait for such a long time to breed plants adapted to the altered environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form themselves and as bre@@ eders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breed a variety , also bre@@ eds its own values into it . &quot;
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures for their cultivation of mas@@ sen@@ ic her@@ b@@ ici@@ des is bre@@ eds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such , which move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create the majority of smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either lean the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the avoid@@ ance of plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than a company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I always need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected against competition for 20 years , with which I think it &apos;s very easy . &quot; worldwide Reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept has now spread rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also helps them to get on &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country where the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is at the Govern@@ ments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from across East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed oil movement and the global trend towards seed production . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official starting signal is expected next year . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hoping that more people will soon recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly focused on where and how something is grown , and seed systems hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock content on the internet .
&quot; this time , it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about that . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are being exploited to overcome the blocking and not giving up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt un@@ available websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; Blog@@ ger , the provider in which also Canada &apos;s blog is given a home , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how police exer@@ cised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; locking blogs is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to convey the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; an arrest , a su@@ icide murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ ts ) , Egyptian authorities blocked websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Eti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ ts also documented the blocking of providers by enabling Internet ship@@ ments and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the locking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offer . &quot;
&quot; such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering information , which could have access to Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian people have no legal basis through which they can proceed against these actions against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

&quot; day after day newspapers in all Brazil report dark head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot at school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is mur@@ dered , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe tigh@@ ten pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio won the highest level for ten years in Rio . &quot;
the Global Justice &apos;s Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization even called on the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the editorial reporting on violence in Rio released the editorial &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; newspaper on August 16 , the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for her decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; it will continue to report about crimes committed in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry : that &apos;s not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security there are 8@@ 43 territories controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discussion , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency of public service . &quot;
&quot; in memory , the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is larger than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia &apos;s most violent place in Brazil , Rio de Jan@@ eiro is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; if we look at the rate of mor@@ ality per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; these safety policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit raised by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to con@@ quer a Fav@@ ela and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux c@@ ited from one of his articles in 2010 , expla@@ ining why the violence in Rio did not meet the criteria established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio is also pulling serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; distor@@ ted bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week now , the police came up with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a police officer . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helic@@ opter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the region East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 caused the life of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massac@@ re has been perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been under si@@ ege controlled by re@@ bel areas outside Damascus , which led people to rely on locally produced or through tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed east of Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ iters . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been strug@@ gling for three years to introduce this project and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Thu . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ing fung@@ i , such as Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Thu until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative depends on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the short@@ age of fuel , locally produced fuel are used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions , &quot; before exam@@ ining their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , they planted a small Pil@@ z@@ hof in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking of si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , box , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were held in the North of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state last week of solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks , spread over the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar trage@@ dy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European for@@ estry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas with satellite images alone , in 2017 alone in Portugal , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the Dis@@ cover@@ able trage@@ dy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to em@@ ulate the extent of the trage@@ dy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they didn &apos;t put this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar trage@@ dy could have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are ques@@ tioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the forest of forest , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was offensive by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees are made of easily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after bre@@ aching of this species . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15th and 16th October , when citizens examined information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was thus crucial that the server did not resist the attack of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan was started by the Tali@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the Eth@@ nic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother did not say so , she knew she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy was supposed to break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the ha@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been mur@@ dered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected . &quot;
&quot; the Tali@@ ban @-@ known Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked for a couple of years in a co@@ h@@ ort . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were shaped by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t fro@@ ze at night .
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
&quot; in the dangerous passage of the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high growth rates , but it is also true that the conditions of asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disa@@ stro@@ us . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an emergency centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - what can be drawn for months after registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who do not have money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
but his innocent li@@ king helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af stuck all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of the Afgh@@ an enterprise , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Orient Experience restaurant where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp Restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim back to the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily if I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development to the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey myself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ edle Report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , vic@@ tories and emerging trends in global internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament veri@@ fies a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
&quot; users must opt @-@ in to use social networks within six months of a successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , stat@@ ing their full name and identity number . &quot;
&quot; who missed this step , could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or the en@@ du@@ ement of a pen@@ al payment . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was promoted by six@@ ty members of Parliament , is currently facing the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the legislat@@ ure filed a law proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for ins@@ ul@@ ting the president or high officials . &quot;
&quot; under the law pro@@ position , such an act would be pun@@ ish@@ able with prison and fin@@ es , legal experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the sentenced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ mine a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he held violence against prot@@ esters held against the military coup that had led to the im@@ pedi@@ ment of the elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in j@@ ail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison leadership failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one so many human rights groups agree , imp@@ licit exposure of e.g. weapons ownership , illegal gathering , murder and su@@ icide murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for reporting on pro @-@ mor@@ si seats on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists to listen to through @-@ backed documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; according to the plan , Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been supported by the President of the Republic , which expressly supports a controversi@@ al bill of action , supported by business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , insofar as they give back all illegal funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April , sheds light on how the pres@@ idential plans to support the legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia den@@ oun@@ ced the nom@@ ination of his sources , stat@@ ing article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Council , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the district court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China intend to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the National Council of People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before writing or sharing news in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that the registration with full real name will be required .
anal@@ ysts believe that this elimin@@ ates the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is un@@ clear up until now how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese net@@ citizens have proposed in social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .

&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make public services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently owned websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ bik@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish Court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia Administr@@ ators refused to delete two English articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication provided that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to address a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs , de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted t@@ elec@@ om companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation will continue until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
