<seg id="1">"although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, dancing American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the supreme court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very fanatical love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he is dealing with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his view, he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women publicly."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in crowds for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won at the Republican presidential election was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic program that takes people from all over the world, a deep gutter person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in addition, Trumps Weltanschauung was not translated by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"trumps Intolerance is also contrary to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for their lives, and their husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump deciphered his way to nominated Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to oversee these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of them know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(meaning of the Whites against all other ethnicities"; word game from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means so much as slingshot), as it was the great Van Jones, did exactly what America has done so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of an Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, say they."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brooded the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a coherent and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">"what happened to the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura?"</seg>
<seg id="70">"that music, which is played in both places, has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among the tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, the La banda de música (music band) plays in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs of violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with glittering eyes and play in the bustle you will learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with revitalized instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler began to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local environmentalist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, reminds us of the early times:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as Favio something, which he had never seen before: a violin made of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tonnes of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest, as the people in Cataila, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational acting from trash music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"accordingly, the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal offender of this species on their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles swiftly mobilized themselves against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbours and refused to grant him a fishing licence."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of plundering fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa was founded: a network of countries to stop 2012 by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like the same and work together. they exchange information and stand out where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, leader of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is trapped is hidden, why it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while action against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail speed, with the information between individual countries, the actions now happen in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also attends very attentively the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship will charge its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay off punishment, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then a considerable financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the so-called platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishing, which penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive Thun-fish fisheries which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also some illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license documents, stating fantasy names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-completely organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could say" You don't dared to run my harbor. ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loophole, FISH-i tries to close."</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found refuge ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing for long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations really can influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened Oceana's Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine World Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each individual traceable vessel can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project where a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fiscated without a license and hardly expected to have consequences now know they are being observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now recorded a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after the help of FISH-i Somalia, the inspectors were on board the towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually vanish through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined forces to go to the so-called West Africa Task Force. now they fight against illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "with certainty, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's most recent Member State Somalia announced its first great triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship running under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing nets, which are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still penetrated into prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working in the whole world of the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to spread to: demonstrations in several cities with the goal of conquering the country"</seg>

<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and profits are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on a large scale was considered the only way to give the country a chance to reconquer its institutional structures and close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="199">"when he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba."</seg>
<seg id="200">"as a grown-up man, Quijano now told Quijano as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father."</seg>
<seg id="201">"the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigated crimes perpetrated during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of his family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that this was OK.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">"at that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison."</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="231">"during the first and last time, he let me wait at the entrance of the car."</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were abandoned and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">"since then, the prisoners are tortured."</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">"later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable, and the other end was fixed to the body of the person who was tied up there."</seg>

<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that one person can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>

<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance guarded people silently on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner, he said," "Why do you think so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied" "Why did you otherwise bring me down?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man there and killed.</seg>

<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into cuadra until the order from above came that they were to be transferred."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The "warriors"</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things home.</seg>

<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why do their bodies disappear?"</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driver's license, witnessed a very unsuccessful translation last month."</seg>

<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apologies:</seg>
<seg id="359">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast news spread somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of "fearful" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" terrible "was denounced as an inadequate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, who are involved in the country far in accidents, is quite a cause of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents caused by seniors were caused by a total of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, their share rose to 17.7%."</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the author, which was not named, brought comments to the light published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese apparently do against older drivers:"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate them, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate into French for example - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies don't employ any staff with English as a native language, which might produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have foreign employees, can make translations available in the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English language is considered to be the best, is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the provocative and enigmatic sentences, which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique can still not replace human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government which have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source of translations."</seg>

<seg id="394">"other online broadcasters also recorded the protests of the protests in Caracas, organised by oppositionist groups, who contradict the government Nicolás Maduros."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was tipped, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet."</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before she graduated from the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her." she's like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one who has become something", "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began working as a criadita for the family. as a criadita, in Paraguay, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her minor son or her minor daughter to another, more prosperous family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that you can't lift up."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to its involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criobis - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the criadazgo - gathered testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude which is vaccinated by the Cricta is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that she can abstain from her education, improve her position in society, and can" "make something out of himself" "can be handed over to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family, who takes up the girl with her, justifies the exploitation with faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criminazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it only many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never get out of them.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which occurs in secret in Paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín entered the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed tracks of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was criadita in the household of the former military member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked Marín as long as she suffered lethal injury."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply involved in the practice of the crimes committed in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criminazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to infringe the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her criadita sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="457">"their brothers had to work now and began selling candy on the street or on the market, in order to make money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a criadita to the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she was finished with learning, the more leisure she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get an unlimited food." I was allowed to bring more books from the household library as food from the fridge, "she remembers."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image by Pixabay altered by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliament members recently voted on a bill to "regulate the regulations concerning the use and utility of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is adopted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up in order to use citizens' permission to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and circulated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as a" jedwede application that is running and used over the internet to communicate with others by voice, video chess and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed, as the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, member of parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications agency, to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall on a national level around Facebook. due to it, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not so far known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they can control both physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to supply them to a court case."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with legislative elections and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in accordance with a pro-military mindset in parliament in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no different narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predator exists."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see an Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera field, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a state prefecture in Japan Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and Fukushima and Iwate were forced to attack, because the tsunami had disappeared entire coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima prefecture already experienced a nuclear accident, already alone for that reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from the local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, one still tries to settle for six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of dwelling-homes (bargains, casetsu juutaku) to final spare-houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelter shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people living in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of Fukushima evacuation in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi had been more successful. more than 75 percent of evacuation in homes were moved into final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have been severely affected."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 acres of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the" nuclear blockage zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far away."</seg>

<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation."</seg>

<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of those questioned that still not enough has been done in disaster prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused their attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacements."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the stand of 2017, still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuation companies, who are still in BehelfsAccomodation hausen, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is part of the Olympics which are part of the Olympic Games that are scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane producers.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region and the factory lost after and after its facilities until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resign and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive time because they were preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene recalls precisely that in Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016 production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced volumes."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvest is no more news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane producers were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive were they unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"however, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" "agricultural perspectives" "published by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do they by hip-hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, a workshop leader has been bringing mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres for youth groups to bring song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and collaborated in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Gruppe The Northstar."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop increases with the fact that the young participants in conversation issues like" cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsummath First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a section in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a rophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will consume our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "plastic models of the dishes" ") of any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers are looking at these plastic courts and then decide whether to enter or pass the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies that produce even those plastic courts that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually so common that they do not even attract them anymore. however, a new trend is turned into striking mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in the special sale: new with plastic cards decorated cellphone bands, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitsch collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food orders is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an Kaisa-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl we found a good use as a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some handy and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, IKURA or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic courts may also take a less appetizing form, for example colleagues or family members to surprise unpleasantly."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest phone-stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"we also offer rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico the misercists and killed are regularly reflected in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every skeleton in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "learning with drug trafficking" ") that is to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were killed in the battle between criminal prosecution authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers, and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vijque Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for every weekend secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" like every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today to seek out and to search for graves, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>

<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but it does not get them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we come from?" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with pictures that can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is contrasting or sad. it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks that he wants Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is not normal that people listen to songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone, and those who fear that they have happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of people is unbelievable for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village justified them that they were" shallow. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to persuade that they remain spared from such tragedies unless they are stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months of blackmail in the HauptstadtDistricts, "as a family with threats has been pillaged."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never goes wrong, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are removed from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I wondered whether wines would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potted potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, saw the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed with the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the number of murders for public security and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average of 8,5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave organised crime in Mexico and penetrate them into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those that we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank-car crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths filled with holes that were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the lorries fell victim to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"representatives of the authorities described a Fireball, the dozens of houses wrapped up including a cinema in the vicinity that was full of people watching the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and carbonated corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>

<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from the imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonated bodies that are strung on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly wronged real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Witnesses reported drastic of atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one left to count corpses," "said a people to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were smashed, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be shown figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris. "</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has been documenting orders for Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments, such as this example falsely wronged the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following ones reported these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an acid Arab news page, which mistakenly claimed that President Burma's Thein Sein had said, monk and politicians have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to survey this information."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regards to major discussions about silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are ambitious people who accidentally have a share of drinking water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and does the actual horror of what happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been discussed in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"an argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and give them the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study which examined how violent media work on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from the context or in a completely abble way."</seg>

<seg id="944">"a blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) endeavours to offer language inspired a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate at all."</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these confusing words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes somewhat context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist chose" "untranslatable" "Steven Bird to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu like:"</seg>
<seg id="952">Vakasteglok - Get your parents in recognition of how they have strived for you in your younger years.</seg>

<seg id="1018">"but in the Western conception, Rumis was deleted, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>

<seg id="1028">A powerful group exerts its "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong Narrative weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on American soil by Africans who were brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this narrative has so profound and flawed our collective imagination, that often Sikh's men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassings."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the Anglican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the Old Town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"it was proclaimed by the group" "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" "(civic front for the re-examination of the debts) and the ecumenical assembly of Puerto Ricos."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of reaffirmation of the debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, banks and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without any personal interest in public debts, with a fixed, working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favour of the economy."</seg>

<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, published books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and licensed here is a series of articles that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built, and what are the real costs associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the Adra prison's directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice, who push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own fate, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military facility."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police "bassel had taken part in Adra as a" strictly secret "command of the military court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and brought it into knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more predictable than the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, embodying this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this stripe into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a newspaper capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, sharing his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he has taught other detainees to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other detainees as they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prosabuch that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: due to corruption, director after release returned to previous post"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"with anger, MOTIBIKANER reacted with anger for corruption, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funding from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-setting to the company, which happened on April 19th."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic which rejected the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to its old post, as the company did not accomplish any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not call the action good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the refutation.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the company seems to be silent, however, and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" contradictory ":"</seg>

<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1271">"Biton Viage, young MOTIBIKANER and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he offended him, I can not believe that one is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only served by the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state when dealing with an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeus preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to recall that a thief is in prison:"</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar PAE" means chickpeas or ducts.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censores the word" "Kalar" "or" "Kalar" "as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abject connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that mostly uses Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts, for purposes of his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burial words with fundamental meanings that have the same character sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair in Burmically is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (column), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebook User Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hacks believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needed to be more analytic before releasing all posts that were suspected of racism in the suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It fills the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar PAE". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, spread the hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply begin using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was told the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook Community Standards failed". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Enshring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a huge turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">• Facebooks Auto censorship provided users with lots of mockery.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the grid."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat a pea curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>

<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is said to heighten the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine territory, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to take control of the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running rather than focusing on context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learnt from them."</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for over a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technology-sealed Internet users are used to use reversing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has recently blocked articles from Wikipedia, recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet since 2007 take place after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the interplanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which does not support domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is irrevocable in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to lay snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to look at at least any Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Foto von Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around himself. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and well-washed colours."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese animal world to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, gives it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook like this first-class location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the border of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just returned home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that was a leopard on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to bend images!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know, for he was standing before face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb himself from the opinion of the sheep by sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the busik appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for fostering Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at Bardia National Park recordings of adders. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a Content Sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care, the name of their husbands, or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, and the fear of the consequences should uphold the norm in keeping this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted from the Indian state Odisha by a false court and expelled from her family and the village community after having contacted a married relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also is not common in the name, is also widespread among men. however, they have far less embarrassment to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main focus of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with her videocamera for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in her discussion rounds, acted by women who call her husbands not by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open up the discussion of the patriarchy with a problem with which women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud, is a custom that they all maintain compulsory and have never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not consider this is considered to be deceitful, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband never named her name, wanted to try at home as it works."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Botanic representations</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to take the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does this mean that they don't respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about crushing a centuries-old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Botanic representations</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so timid that, during the whole exercise, she had only kicked himself off; another decided to let out all the accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try home to name their husbands in their name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared she got afraid, and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini thought I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, indicating the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnod point if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not quit altogether, but think that they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at each point of discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out to the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never really talked about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it is okay, but some wanted to wear a salsa-Kura, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes choice, morals associated with the Saris and much more, botanically linked their own pair of Kurtas (upper hemden) into a discussion, so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans, and Rohini is sure they will manage it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question of whether something changed in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made little steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women rehearsed it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot at any time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rushing of more freedom of movement or their own clothes choice - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate flow.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reports about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers Community come from excluded groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and some of the organs were taken out.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that was probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the fall of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo drew attention in the international community, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital because of liver cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" "Subversion" "(state endangerment) after he had taken part in the draft of the Charta 08, a manifesto that demanded the democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Lius case as an" "internal affair" "and narrated a spokesman, he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him to treat abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"a spokesman refused, however, to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to make Liu a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government told us that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"the diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trip to China, as the exports were largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed its hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on July 6, the European Parliament adopted a decision taken by China to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as stated in an explanation on June 30:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to lift up all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"they should meet and receive all the visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world."</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">"U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad shared with the fact that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad, in so far as he can help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"speaking in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, the news agency AFP announced on 27 June that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities should not only release Liu, but also release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the prompting of the US Embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Foreign Ministry, that" no country has the right to interfere and unanswerable comments on Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">"" "Polley told us that China should offer the following:"</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system and international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also instituted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1660">"German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on 3 July, Berlin hopes Liu" gets all the medical support he needs "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">"previously, diplomatic sources reported in Peking of the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns, whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg."</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called China to provide adequate medical care and to give it the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Liu's attorney told AFP previously that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always watched the room at the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and establish contact."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum goes on:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including free speech, and to freeze intervening rights for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">French Foreign Ministry demanded China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">"all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"although the news transmitter France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information out whether France would eventually receive it."</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taipei</seg>
<seg id="1673">"the Council of the Embassy in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu, and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be dealt with in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Holiness the Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">"the spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 um Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and was severely punished for which he had been severely punished, led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, with most people mistake a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a mandatory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of this, it inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities which are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once one reaches the nucleus of the subject, the good old lyre appears from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final effect the recent weeks of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He also disguised relevant questions with Non-Answers of rational Art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our town..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the reviews that one should start reading the entire headline of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the codex.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these towns saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore was not a country," he obviously did not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam as leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he truly believes it is properly associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review kicks off the weaknesses of Shanmugams reasoning:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam have committed a mistake? or was it a Freudian spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"when Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is both land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore pay their military service, but do they not defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the journal Journey of a Decade tends to affirm, Singapore is and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defence of the country above all "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defense of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1736">The Myth of the "nice Canadian"</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">"your answers will be published here as part of a series of progress, revealing rumors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another facet."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the most recent part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I asked most in Japan is: "are you American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry I am sorry." I am from Canada. "since 1994 I live in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered courteous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"in my clarification, the default response usually follows:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians may cook presumably against anger if they are kept for Americans, but I don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that differs Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small mapleleaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everybody seems to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it would not matter if you would change me, for example, Johnny from Dallas."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" "nice" "is basically to be spicacious - like the benign, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nice" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Be harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that pass around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a main characteristic of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders call" "nice" "is perhaps just chilly politeness."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness, which I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau also entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada downright sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parody Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">"a pop band released in Thailand has released a music video that parodies the Junta, which took the power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not expressly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1,254 times and received 8.800 Likes."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month even the Charlie Chaplin video" "The Dictator" "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, especially as it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently followed over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconic section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives an absolute decision to the commander of the army on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the infamous program for the" change-in "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered to be a critic by the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which monitors the online content and persons accused of having been accused of having been persecuted, prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand establishes a strict harming against "" Lese Majest "." "</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, the war was declared in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the issues that Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into a detention camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they supposedly caused" "confusion" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment, they should insult the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the songs became members of the band, who imitated the Salut out of" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by putsch opponents during the 2014 protests."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez is a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken has been published on the website of our partner PRI.org on April 19, 2017 and is published here with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year old Mexicans, a small woman with a corals-pink Brillengestell and golden earrings in Teddy Bears."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, she knows many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">There is a parrots in a cage in the anteroom.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - there are hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medications that they cannot pay, she massages them with a balm that drew from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil already, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that the Africans already speak at Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go," he answers smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they are gone to welcome her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chickens like Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken up migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapinula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackmailed money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-in-one, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, the travelers check their telephones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair plasters that she made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"at the same time, a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which they instructed the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app" "prevents access to terrorist information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police notified that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remote control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "state actors or even hackers able to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while notifying digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and the South, the reality is often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme zensers and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlets based on Twitter, published on Twitter, published the zenry news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen assaulted the inhabitants indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected in a Checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by means of rest technology.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"" "images from BAU China" "has published a Jingwang product description, which emphasizes that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtains unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and the party related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of cyber security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report from Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>

<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation, "he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so because I am a human being" "while in water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senseless hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the Schlücke lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if you take a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink in the public during Ramadan Water - in order not to land in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior of Jordaniens announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsängers Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert speech."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesperson of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the band's commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism, which represents the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as a" progressive supporter of human rights, "who still opted for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflected increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib recovered traditional gender norms by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently stunted unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of" "volunteers" "took place in Jordan - the unofficial outwardly left."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still more difficult that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder murders or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can" "detained indefinitely in prison," and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"even Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues, which in his country were long as taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allegations on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib attack the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every one is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were heavily ensored until in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Roya jordan online program to remember that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and his views were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is advertised openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuda, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory even today thanks to his homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asked himself: if Abu Nudel, who later should work on behalf of the caliphes, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordaneer not that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctifies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian messenger assumed several former government members and members of the teacher association, with the reason that they have critically expressed themselves on comments in social media critically related to the problems associated with the deep-rooted corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in light of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, even from an Arab world without any intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will open up with the help of music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, aspiration and artificial cracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origins of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the forts, drums and dancing have been handed over for more than one thousand years, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region that force emissions to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the barber."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drugs are commonplace."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region feel not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru experienced - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers, which can form these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts meet each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks like you can see in the following video (further videos to current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and receive training in hair art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">Dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special educational workshops before the school year commencing in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community for love with the children."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Foto: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" Liebesmessenger to Guerillakfighters, "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"isn't it much more important, people who feel expelled, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Columbian activists Leonardo Párraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation) that encourages young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently her land was a scene of a historical event, and they wanted to help her part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla deflection FARC, which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Columbians, however, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillakfighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take up their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that is exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - messages sent to former guerrilla warriors to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - who should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the United Nations camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves as they had previously done to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive instructions, but letters of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "said the student assistant Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a colleague of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior carried me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed lay a mgl-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the sleeping bag."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I answered him, saying," "Hello, what do you do right now?" "he answered," "I reply to a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful to me, so I answer". "I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranes.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry, too, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC were joined to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as already war and the FARC already acted in secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"so the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "one of them said."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never heard their hearing and had no voting right, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their habitats and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Columbian was proof that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to seize arms and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a Damois complainant about the local LGBTQ community is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago, after reports published which addressed the depreciation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milazina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who captured suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"even since childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechnung had experienced of the gender settlement of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear for her life last Endes to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a voluntary helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"one day, I was told that someone needed my help."</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a transwife who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents went through the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was there to bring out some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you Schandfleck? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last end in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what medical wings have you been put in - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to return to Chechnya, to prove that all was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said to me, I have to prove it by walking up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just evil and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have particle size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the whole republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window panes and a numerical plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something unbelivable."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without identification, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe that you are in security just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are about. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This actually was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, that is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I am actually trying to look like the person to which she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had imprisoned in arcane one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no man were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so-called" "honor" "has been experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to judge Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately underwent to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote somebody who was imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself, when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, which belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, took place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">I had a Bob in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003 I was already known in quite Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was true, I had never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to" "civilisation", "but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never hurt me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"there is a saying in the Chechen language: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't worry about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off before you, because they believed you were ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never hunted and never defeated."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on television over morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled and laughed before, looked at you once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still work as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teetreffs, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clapped the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: are you wearing a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know you with foam before mouth, that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the rodents have what the Cabardans have, which Russians have; on the whole planet there are them - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transitions to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it's the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I'm going to be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in suicides."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to erase the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani Hospital in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: they were all the fathers of the family, who felt helpless and incapable of pursuing their families because of persecution on the part of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, located in the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to complete ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population gains only little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victim of untreated disease, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian territory where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish- and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawks young now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at exterminating the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist, residing in London, said Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicides among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic percussionists emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process.</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at exterminating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs, forcing them to make their living outside their hometown Ahawaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be so employed, as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists see alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I do not identify with feminism even with intersectional?</seg>
<seg id="2434">Added by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the statement, written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on Afroféminas website."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even think well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I get to speak on skin color, on racism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention the way we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and" "Kumbaya, my master" "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in a two-fold manner."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk with migration background, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuse to consider injustices in her thinking, which relate to the sex as well as the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feministic sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human being in a historical sense and is marginalised."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I allow myself to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different provenance a home and cut off from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to rid myself of feminism and to join the movement of whomanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves, says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are totally safe and where the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that the black woman constitutes."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion once they read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanist environment, I can raise black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life has neither figured, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2469">"Nabil Musa repeatedly traveled in the past seven years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe, with a special concern through the Kurdistan region. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterman Alliance, which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work on a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentaries and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on persecuted, poorly noted subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with whose help oppressed churches can tell their stories in their way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article" The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay "by Electural. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# pastlicheinefraubin), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had become violent to her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time had passed and the police said her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena because of abuse, she also took advantage of Ada Báez's expert ad."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women give advertisements at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be registered at the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than" "Medium" "(default setting)."</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay." there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads went to the District Attorney Office for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace. also here, 86% of the ads of women came."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "on any woman who refuses Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"two women who do not do this," explained them at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's commit in Paraguay is not a separate sentence, the prosecution authorities cannot sufficiently document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"until August 2016, journalists reported at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible maltreatment and a judicial system that does not accept nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she decided. this should always regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she carried out psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it before, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had dropped the so long of Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain amount of innocence.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner mistreated her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo (" "I believe you" ") which consists of women who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"finally, her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's ads with the authorities stayed without any result and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable juridical struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was primarily concerned with money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay's laws: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems with the application of laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# for you)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-EineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law foresees to explain Femdom to an independent offense and punish harsher as it is already in the neighboring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the legislative text was changed in some points in order to also raise the deputies for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is generally prohibited, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill of legislation foreseen most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural cost that the victims of violence have to wear at present themselves, if they simply furnish an indication and would like to receive a secure accommodation to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funding for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relations."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"those who are silent in the face of these facts, take responsibility and contribute to the perpetrators of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must allow such a long indication until mishandling is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate."</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victims again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"however, the cancellation of the words" gender, "" political violence "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law is regarded as a great setback."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on-site: there are a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is undertaken by African scientists, helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Research of Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic first showed serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he even researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the sambal health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. I support the sambal national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"I also stared a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiaries, rather than being makers."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">Q: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and academics in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa vis-à-vis Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the US since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company has 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was confined only by its own imagination and the question of how many Salatines can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red- or green tone or ruffled leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food safety for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but he now needs longer, because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I must treat.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they resist court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and strives to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the US and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Römersalat of grade Outredded in the "Greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to be able to freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders do only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow them - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffolding views</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereignty, without sovereignty, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to keep others freely available to others, as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is always available."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are not such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants like wheat in even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Viewing</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so disciplined that they have specifically desired characteristics - from such by which their taste or colour improves to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more unnecessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are much worse predictable by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto Speechin Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties "innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent lasts, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if one has to wait for such a long time to breed plants adapted to the altered environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">Morton interfered with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breed a variety, also breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures for their cultivation of massenic herbicides is breeds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is exactly opposite." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such, which move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, they create the majority of smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either lean the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be innovative by the avoidance of plant patents:" "it looks like I with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than a company that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I always need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years," he says. "with a patent, one is protected against competition for 20 years, with which I think it's very easy." worldwide Resonance "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept has now spread rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to get on "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country where the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; now it is at the Governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from across East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed oil movement and the global trend towards seed production."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for the Hivos' programme for" open source "seed systems, explains that the organization currently building a global alliance for" open source "seed systems for which the official starting signal is expected next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of Ossi hoping that more people will soon recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly focused on where and how something is grown, and seed systems hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers in all Brazil report dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Diebe tighten pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Airwafee to Rio."</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Global Justice's Brazilian non-governmental organization even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were held in the North of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state last week of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks, spread over the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas with satellite images alone, in 2017 alone in Portugal, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon."</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the forest of forest, which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was offensive by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall, if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open rear door, so that everything could be built," João Sorval continues in the same article of the paper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees are made of easily combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, after breaching of this species."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15th and 16th October, when citizens examined information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was thus crucial that the server did not resist the attack of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a cohort. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran were shaped by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't froze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"in the dangerous passage of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid in need twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high growth rates, but it is also true that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an emergency centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - what can be drawn for months after registration of the asylum application."</seg>

<seg id="2903">But his innocent liking helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf stuck all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
