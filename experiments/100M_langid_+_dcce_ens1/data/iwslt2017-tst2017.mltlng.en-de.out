this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally sur@@ rendered to Iran for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not fall into the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been det@@ a@@ ined against cra@@ cks and ur@@ ged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condem@@ n whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to sp@@ y journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ age@@ ous they claim . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had been necessary for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and springs can always hide less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of fail@@ ing and bringing cra@@ cks to the statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secre@@ tly concerned about his telephone conversation , &quot;
&quot; as well as its email data , financial and bank information , its loans , and even real@@ ms with the list of flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ y out all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology by the government allows users to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet been written when cra@@ cks written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source umbrella system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ y technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to apply mis@@ set@@ ates . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; or the next environmental worker who sends alarm to contam@@ inated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street Insider , who warned us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
publication of these documents gives a glimp@@ se into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ aic Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has resign@@ ed .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has lob@@ b@@ ying companies in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ pt away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not paying all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret control o@@ ases of some few are used to hide their wealth and disgu@@ ise -- something that we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who &apos;s behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , because there were no prominent Americans who were present in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data collection from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to set up less information to create a firm than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to ch@@ ase school children .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator came out as an African minister , who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really sho@@ cked us that all of us made suggestions as to how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers were accepted as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our conce@@ aled inquiry .
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very glo@@ omy , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a secure optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen progress towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU records in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need exec@@ utives in the economy that rise and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency that is now enabling this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost escaped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made an outlet . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ trip across the country . after that he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep t@@ onight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the blank@@ et and thought &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a game alien sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , embarrass@@ ed on to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hang@@ s today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
&quot; perhaps the people , who were sold to me as a stranger in childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time lea@@ p , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ready , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
publisher * click here
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite other people to stay overnight . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
&quot; no one who is still at Tro@@ st would invest in a business , allowing foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children have lear@@ nt that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things you can do well . we could dis@@ solve . &quot;
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make something like this ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree we trust .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ umbs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this quiet flight of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
&quot; because the only thing more personal than your mobile phone is , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel like holding the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
the majority feel the responsibility .
most of the guests feel like staying elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; so , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please tell us on Twitter that he is can@@ ised for the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had imag@@ ined himself with his name , if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 convi@@ ctions that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked hands !
how would you feel when you need to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system strength@@ ens confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to aband@@ on negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stands out for simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much you can buy . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can we create it with design to establish this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds upon the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
&quot; with what we did not expect , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the un@@ ti@@ ring work of our team . &quot;
thir@@ dly : a need not previously been covered .
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate or have apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment , which one h@@ ears in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays were only a fra@@ ction of a problem . &quot;
for men trusted one another to the right .
&quot; if trust is functioning , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they are not really familiar with them . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books . &quot;
they leave one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay runs off . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure financial transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled on this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but now it is simply a &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; to call it , the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel these days , you can compare with Fast Food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what would be , if at any place you were visiting , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a Knei@@ pent@@ ine neighborhood of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , homes are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would shape apartments from ground to clas@@ sm@@ ate ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take thought of the common part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already started . many parking spaces belonging to the government &quot;
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a residence were
&quot; were taught to people whose children had gone out , inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there were also some warm hospitality before .
there were already similar sites prior to us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think that is amazing
absolutely overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes to me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , under@@ going bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only accept pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
&quot; I read it , thought , thought , dou@@ b@@ ted and eventually believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understand and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Break@@ ing News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes fle@@ w in buildings , people j@@ ump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock was quickly turned into rebel@@ lion .
why should I do this ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and listened : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terr@@ orists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in N@@ u the actions of others turned from a citizen to susp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went in silence -- as we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time fear@@ ing to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; do not meet you . &quot;
I stayed there all week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings said : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were believed to be free and defeated . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because the people who attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I grab@@ bed the anger of the people on the terr@@ orists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the USA &apos;s body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , assist@@ ants and Olympics . &quot;
is the closure of mos@@ ques US safer to make ?
&quot; there might be some parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people in other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC said recently , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process it has found that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group thinks that the terr@@ orists are the true Muslims , and anyone who det@@ ests their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still say that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establis@@ hes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an . &quot;
&quot; as Muslims , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
&quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity . &quot;
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; sacred book . &quot;
&quot; but when looking at them , they do not drive on what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had planned to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of inj@@ us@@ tice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m establis@@ hes the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does normal Americans look like ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims up@@ stairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts to all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the allocation of collective debt , it is not only about having to explain oneself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the Faculty of Denti@@ stry , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has become such an accomplished young man from my little brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has mur@@ dered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visited in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also deadly .
&quot; so , back to the beginning . &quot;
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and put off my shoes , and went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m gave an announcement , thank@@ ed himself and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .

&quot; Helen Walker : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with dr@@ au@@ ght , working in a class@@ y mind factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive me . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually do as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no way , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for industrial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air pa@@ iring into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
connecting flights reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces .
you can also build self @-@ destruc@@ tible structures .
&quot; they learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it has to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we are using a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
an air@@ plane trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other Star@@ r @-@ flies , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most star@@ ters , it can fluctu@@ ate , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of hed@@ ge@@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind @-@ ar@@ ches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ plane does not matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions which advance at the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pil@@ ots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ d@@ der . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote @-@ operated flight machine . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ d@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the stern mounting . to get it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it right when all of them watch is low , so I show you a video fil@@ med last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in in@@ genu@@ ity , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the &quot; &quot; external capability &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive streams of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is available in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at it .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they have to be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction .
&quot; when one builds them together , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if also restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ squares -- every single weigh@@ s less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the very safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y . they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big bang .
but they did not set off their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in a tempor@@ al way .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ zel@@ liges lives were created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ age@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as mad gen@@ ies so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased considerably , which greatly improved the recognition rate . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ de black holes smo@@ ked through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well to my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ru@@ ff@@ ling in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other one . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lectur@@ ers in cur@@ ses lead to rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a properly al@@ gebra@@ ic dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ amped by us at the occurrence of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than one eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
this is quite practical . for this way you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
&quot; in tones , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice says . &quot;
&quot; and Bob canc@@ els her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; dear Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make any simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to grav@@ itation can tell us about the col@@ lision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just about : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same circulation with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , embos@@ sed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listen to Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what he has to hear can recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold s@@ uns@@ creen that revol@@ ves around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : we are thinking about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , re@@ or@@ bit one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all we can &apos;t see -- handy or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through as they are opa@@ que .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big Bang is hidden by its own light . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see and from which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are an enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the sour cher@@ ries for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o enables us to create a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I ta@@ sted an experiment .
for one year I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; before which I was afraid .
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , spe@@ eches to hold , my social anxiety -- bu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; but there was a certain &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; that changed my life to an unexpected item . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; pussy , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked her once , if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from there I swe@@ ar to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently , I really understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m author . I think things out I aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce television .
&quot; I am making television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; five epis@@ odes : grey &apos;s , 21 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
&quot; across the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around bon@@ fires and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who does that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I do not want to im@@ press you with it .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you are now running a company , a country or a class@@ room , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not about dreams when a dream job is . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is as if I put up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so you can carry a high sound , deliver a mar@@ athon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and sensible . and the best thing about it is sum@@ ming . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a sum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sum@@ s that I &apos;m writing over writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and to work and to work , build , create and work together , I discovered that matter , this sum@@ s , this energy . &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s are action and activity . the sum@@ s are a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can do not want anything other than the size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not able to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is called gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the mar@@ athon I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burnt out . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single work tan .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , there is not , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think , &quot; how@@ l , stup@@ id author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you &apos;re working , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; South @-@ states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say No when two things are aware of me :
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan , and my bu@@ zz will be@@ have , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ s , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out . &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I create , the mar@@ athon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it comes loose , or whatever the girl lets go in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost enters .
&quot; and that does not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s slowly comes back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let us stick to the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forget what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum@@ s are no strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum is dependent on love .
sum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be experienced , the expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; true sum@@ s are God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any gu@@ ilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not so much like working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person would rather work to be a home ? &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ attle around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bu@@ bb@@ les .
&quot; I mainly feel sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfilled me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to the games ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most than 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie will replace me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ y daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it . &quot;
everyone can get 15 minutes on the track even in a bad mood tag !
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no de@@ fle@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner for children to get ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is important to feel the sum@@ s , to have a place for their peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
&quot; to &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I will triumph . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to beat myself more and more .
15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fil@@ ls me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bu@@ bb@@ les and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but just one part . I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s me s@@ nap that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who is playing to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , asp@@ iring , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I &apos;m author . I think things out I aw@@ aken you to life .
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;

I am neuro@@ surgical .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
that &apos;s probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor attemp@@ ting to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; for sure they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe cit@@ rus and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ al is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure rises .
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there was Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology lesson , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; they were slowly divided , and after a few weeks they even died . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the cle@@ av@@ age of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells . &quot;
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then select color to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we went on to the un@@ loading table of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ plant these cells in normal cer@@ ebral tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and im@@ planted just the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we color in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take feed p@@ ellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured in the motor cor@@ tex the hand mot@@ oric area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they recovered spont@@ an@@ eously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree as well as the monkeys .
&quot; as we were sure that the mon@@ key had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
on the left side you see the mon@@ key which relax@@ es spont@@ an@@ eously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we planted the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can fre@@ eze them and later use them .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson &apos;s . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill out about two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms to under@@ go these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can get to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ti@@ ght@@ ness .
we believe capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ less that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect austerity programs realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sin@@ cere friends who repeatedly said to me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are bl@@ amed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies wa@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all see the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but only a few realize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the weal@@ thy as@@ par@@ agus and corporations , which are too timi@@ d to invest where it would be productive and produce income with which one could wear the debt level and also produce all the things that humanity urg@@ ently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3,4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial installations , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low demand for the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who claim that their son would kill him if he will grow , &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally causing the circumstances that lead him to k@@ ills him .
this is my rowing with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital ought to be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it was depri@@ ved of the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but it is more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting weight in questions of state matters . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy has not lasted for a long time --
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on policy , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradu@@ ating the economy gradually and em@@ powers them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like it before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because you can nowadays be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that are so sustainable the animals from which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized politics itself , that it grows through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations increases , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falls , the general economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the Twin Summit , and the greater the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union ought to be that the working arms gain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that such a long economy and politics are separated areas , automation lets the twin @-@ summit exceed the waste , and the social conflicts deeply , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and take care that we will democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a dise@@ ased surveillance hyp@@ er @-@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has brought forth -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that is similar to human society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it look like , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the business sector : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income derived from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and savings , and ultimately no raising twin apples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please note that our national currencies would have a freely swa@@ yed exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woo@@ ds Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time no technical means had to be implemented .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is also liberal in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
CH@@ EC@@ K.@@ point @-@ el@@ earning ?
you write yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls for &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transfer@@ ring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Ha@@ ye@@ k , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfectly t@@ win@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you aren &apos;t , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein , who said it . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you consider from the West &apos;s point of view . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is res@@ em@@ bling the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
it was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ elling to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about their experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say goo@@ dbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant den@@ ial that a massive deteri@@ oration line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try an economic system that is not viable to susta@@ in life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destruc@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its construction . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anybody who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the don@@ ors , who imposed upon us this policy , stood : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the fre@@ ed cent@@ ri@@ ors will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have disa@@ stro@@ us consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; of Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19th , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ gehog and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can not select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the valuation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows will receive this review .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ ted to where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he has more thoughts about the mean pron@@ u@@ cle@@ us , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he requires guaranteed success , so he has a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows by evalu@@ ating eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and when Amazon comes out for free things , one acc@@ esses , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators watch these epis@@ odes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are being watched by Roy and his team that record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show you should produce .
&quot; in fact they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com above four repub@@ li@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7,5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they went into a carriage and decided not to make a sit@@ com above four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what &apos;s that ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work in everything .
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work in such a way , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an dism@@ iss@@ al occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deci@@ ding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data of the most rever@@ sible firms are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predic@@ ted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the simple way -- by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in publishing in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this once again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these mistakes , data flows clearly into decisions of life -- at work , in case of law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use in@@ concei@@ vable many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy . &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into his parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces back together , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what else they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all of these parts , re@@ assemble and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show .
&quot; Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV @-@ ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ime or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- just here at this moment .
I will f@@ encing it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off , make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
