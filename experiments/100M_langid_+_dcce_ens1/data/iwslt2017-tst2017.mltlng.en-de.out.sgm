<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA had illegally heard telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally surrendered to Iran for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not fall into the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been detained against cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they claim."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something unusual happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had been necessary for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and springs can always hide less and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and bringing cracks to the statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly concerned about his telephone conversation,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its email data, financial and bank information, its loans, and even realms with the list of flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology by the government allows users to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet been written when cracks written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source umbrella system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology denominators such as Edward Snowden have a way to apply missetates. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or the next environmental worker who sends alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall street Insider, who warned us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">Publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosaic Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has lobbying companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not paying all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret control oases of some few are used to hide their wealth and disguise -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who's behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data collection from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to set up less information to create a firm than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees of school districts to chase school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator came out as an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all of us made suggestions as to how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers were accepted as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our concealed inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very gloomy, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a secure optimist, I see that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen progress towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU records in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change."</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy that rise and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the intransparency that is now enabling this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost escaped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made an outlet."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a roadtrip across the country. after that he would go to the corps of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought" Oh man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A game alien sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, embarrassed on toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people, who were sold to me as a stranger in childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ready, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Publisher * click here</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite other people to stay overnight."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at Trost would invest in a business, allowing foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learnt that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you are contemplating the things you can do well. we could dissolve."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree we trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing more personal than your mobile phone is, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel like holding the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of the guests feel like staying elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"so, who has actually Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he is canised for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had imagined himself with his name, if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 convictions that all say: "he can really hold on very well unlocked hands!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you need to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to abandon negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that confidence depends on how much you can buy."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, such as:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Great works of art in your home! I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to establish this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds upon the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we did not expect, the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the untiring work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need not previously been covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate or have apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which one hears in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays were only a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trusted one another to the right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust is functioning, miracles can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they are not really familiar with them."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay runs off."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure financial transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is simply a" "rental industry" "to call it, the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel these days, you can compare with Fast Food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at any place you were visiting, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a Kneipentine neighborhood of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, homes are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from ground to classmate?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take thought of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us society and relations, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already started. many parking spaces belonging to the government"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a residence were</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children had gone out, incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There were also some warm hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites prior to us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that is amazing</seg>
<seg id="251">Absolutely overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, undergoing brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness-fanatiker,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified:" "why are you oppressed yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only accept passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, thought, doubted and eventually believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever feeling that someone you perceives you fully understand and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had a child later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" "Egyptian-American Dream." ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and listened:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in Nu the actions of others turned from a citizen to suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate course."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I went in silence -- as we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time fearing to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" do not meet you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed there all week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings said:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were believed to be free and defeated."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I grabbed the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays we can actually hear people say," There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the USA's body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, assistants and Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="330">Is the closure of mosques US safer to make?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be some parking spaces, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people in other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC said recently, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process it has found that it starts online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who detests their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still say that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslims, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">"the IS has so much to do with Islam, such as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity."</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "sacred book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when looking at them, they do not drive on what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had planned to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that made sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam establishes the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans look like?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts to all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the allocation of collective debt, it is not only about having to explain oneself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the Faculty of Dentistry, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has become such an accomplished young man from my little brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, has murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visited in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">"so, back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silent, with high pressure to mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and put off my shoes, and went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam gave an announcement, thanked himself and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="395">"Helen Walker: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>

<seg id="401">I usually do as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">"looking at Muslims around the world and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things."</seg>
<seg id="403">"they want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace."</seg>
<seg id="404">"so, in no way, I am an exception."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for Bastler, is about to become a billionaire business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for industrial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air pairing into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting flights reach high speed and acceleration in tight spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-destructible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we are using a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">An airplane trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starr-flies, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starters, it can fluctuate, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedgestarters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind-arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airplane does not matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask basic abstract questions which advance at the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote-operated flight machine. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern mounting. to get it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right when all of them watch is low, so I show you a video filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in ingenuity, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the" "external capability", ""</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive streams of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is available in models, the rest is learned directly by flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they have to be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-squares -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The very safe machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy. they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit more brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set off their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in a temporal way.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, multi-zelliges lives were created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands at -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as mad genies so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be increased considerably, which greatly improved the recognition rate."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collide black holes smoked through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ruffling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other one."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers in curses lead to relativity-theory often a properly algebraic dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stamped by us at the occurrence of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for this way you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">"in tones, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice says."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob cancels her." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dear Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make any simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just about: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circulation with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, embossed into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listen to Ligo: [Surrender's noise] Someone who knows what he has to hear can recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sunscreen that revolves around as fast as the rods of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are thinking about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, reorbit one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can't see -- handy or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is hidden by its own light."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we will never see and from which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are an enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sour cherries for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo enables us to create a completely different angle of view of the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tasted an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would say "Yes!" before which I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "Yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to hold, my social anxiety -- buff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes" "has changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain" "yes" "that changed my life to an unexpected item. it started with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"pussy, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked her once, if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there I swear to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a startling side effect: only recently, I really understood that the" "yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm author. I think things out I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I am making television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"five episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"across the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not only produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around bonfires and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, if the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you are now running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so that you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreams when a dream job is."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is as if I put up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so you can carry a high sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is summing."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a summing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums that I'm writing over writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work and to work and to work, build, create and work together, I discovered that matter, this sums, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you can do not want anything other than the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not able to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single work tan.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land." ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a titanium doesn't sleep, there is not, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think," howl, stupid author-Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do, you're working, you're working to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you know the sums when you stop the sums, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says:" mum, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say No when two things are aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" estimation. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"she calls no more" "estimating". ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan, and my buzz will behave, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it's outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of sums, I can't do anything except watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it comes loose, or whatever the girl lets go in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost enters.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that does not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stick to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forget what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are no strength and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Summing is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be experienced, the expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums are God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not so much like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person would rather work to be a home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rattle around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfilled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever listen to the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think for naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most than 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or cookie will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teeny daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no need for it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes on the track even in a bad mood tag!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no deflection."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner for children to get ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it is not necessary to be the children. it is important to feel the sums, to have a place for their peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"to" "Play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I will triumph. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">Want to play? "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to beat myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sums is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of the work is part of me, but just one part. I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me snap that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan who is playing to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my camp fire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, aspiring, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide."</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm author. I think things out I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That's probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor attempting to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"for sure they have heard of one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "thereby, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe citrus and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeal is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-brain traumata the brain is swollen and the cranial pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, you sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology lesson, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">"they were slowly divided, and after a few weeks they even died."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the cleavage of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then select color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we went on to the unloading table of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells in normal cerebral tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and implanted just the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we color in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured in the motor cortex the hand motoric area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree as well as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">"as we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey which relaxes spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the Reimplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to undergo these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look further into the future, how many years it takes until someone can get to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable tightness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved doubtless that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect austerity programs realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said to me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Euro group are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are blamed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all see the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few realize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy asparagus and corporations, which are too timid to invest where it would be productive and produce income with which one could wear the debt level and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial installations, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low demand for the pessimism of investors who claim that their son would kill him if he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causing the circumstances that lead him to kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my rowing with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital ought to be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, Athenian democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy because of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in Athenian democracy was and is that it was deprived of the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech, but it is more important and decisive that they grant them the right to political co-determination with equal voting weight in questions of state matters."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy has not lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on policy, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by graduating the economy gradually and empowers them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like it before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you can nowadays be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is immigrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's like a herd of predators that are so sustainable the animals from which they are nourished, decimated, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has so far cannibalized politics itself, that it grows through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations increases, political goods are devalued, the inequality falls, the general economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism expels the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the Twin Summit, and the greater the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy back together, and it would be better if the" demos "retains the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the deacon of the Soviet Union ought to be that the working arms gain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that such a long economy and politics are separated areas, automation lets the twin-summit exceed the waste, and the social conflicts deeply, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to redesign the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and take care that we will democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a diseased surveillance hyper-autocracy that makes the film" "Matrix" "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"therefore, the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has brought forth --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or by something that is similar to human society in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like, how could it look like to have this" Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" Matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the business sector: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no raising twin apples."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please note that our national currencies would have a freely swayed exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time no technical means had to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunited policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is also liberal in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">CHECK.point-elearning?</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography itself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand that Larry Summers calls for" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfectly twined."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you aren't, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said it. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you consider from the West's point of view."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I may say that provocative, China is resembling the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">It was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smelling to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to complacency, and the constant denial that a massive deterioration line went through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to denounce the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try an economic system that is not viable to sustain life through political will and authoritarianism, it might be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its construction."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anybody who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that went through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika of the donors, who imposed upon us this policy, stood:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the freed centriors will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"of Roy Price most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19th, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes itself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for watching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted to where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he has more thoughts about the mean pronucleus, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he requires guaranteed success, so he has a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight Candidates for TV shows by evaluating eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and when Amazon comes out for free things, one accesses, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show you should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom above four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House ends at 7,5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they went into a carriage and decided not to make a sitcom above four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go."</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data-sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What's that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work in such a way, this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an dismissal occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, it can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of the most reversible firms are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the simple way -- by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in publishing in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this once again was a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these mistakes, data flows clearly into decisions of life -- at work, in case of law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use inconceivable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, you disassemble this problem into his parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what else they wouldn't have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all of these parts, reassemble and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV-ideas, then when they chose" "Alpha House". ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start controlling our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Jaime or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly probable" -- just here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fencing it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know when you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is wiser and smarter and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off, make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
