Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution where young people are to meet today .
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is du@@ g . &quot;
Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner cultiv@@ ate the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows everyone who had to get exciting because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place on a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when compar@@ ing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet that one does not recognize equally .
&quot; in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , called ur@@ posi@@ tional leaves , were worked for cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the data from the Bay@@ erische Publisher , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and origin@@ ate from the first survey of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria for military purposes .
&quot; even though the French troops ended up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Prince Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph prop@@ elled the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey management . &quot;
the Munich Ur@@ posi@@ tional Journal of Munich origin@@ ates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ) .
the comparison early / today is most impressive on the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is a rest@@ art which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , thus in 1877 , as the Munich @-@ based district . &quot;
today Unter@@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the u@@ prising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the west @-@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the beginning zo@@ oming a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ writing numbered flags from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urn &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots today no longer prove farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 location of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; On the Venti@@ lation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ma@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and for example ended the Ank@@ le of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor centre in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric hospitals . &quot;
young people meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; West lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residen@@ ces from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural style according to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during World War II in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger lane was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where this day prepar@@ es the preparations and on 5 April 2017 of the ground breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn strain route . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich card can be compared with the a@@ erial picture of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
citizen group publis@@ hes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state and to prevent extreme caution . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the criminal prosec@@ ution authorities of the state which disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people pass through .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US .
&quot; the group c@@ ited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during the trip and was taken cu@@ sto@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are more pre@@ valent than wh@@ ites in the state . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready whether to bring Cau@@ tion money or let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in the year 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos; hate crime report , which ranks the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws that ob@@ lige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lat@@ ely interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the sub@@ project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Hof project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U parliament members Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac got a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the grave yard of the Sch@@ wen@@ demann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U town association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann initially granted insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accom@@ o@@ dates in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative market@@ able way for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only region@@ ales .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ HV President of Fischer@@ bach , he described the sub@@ project as an &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green gro@@ o@@ ves care for a lot of work , much has to be processed with the brush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical pesti@@ cides and fertili@@ zers , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the significance of the electric project and is happy about the leaders of the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
one hope that the for@@ estation of the surfaces could be drawn up for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants . &quot;
the disclosure space thus amounts to 40 hectares which may not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
&quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by half of the leaders , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of soft @-@ grain . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and ma@@ iden@@ s .
&quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg provides the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of soft @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is the holding of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the prerequisite is the presence of a convey@@ ance recorded by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be trac@@ table ( slope inc@@ lin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the challenge . &quot;
&quot; for the Fisher bacher Project 2018 currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;

now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Sad@@ dam Hussein at the Fir@@ gen square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took their meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is literally right , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your ru@@ bb@@ les , your arms , / your displac@@ ed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the el@@ event@@ h waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ event@@ h apost@@ asy &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps US .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confron@@ tation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
&quot; Laz@@ arus - and her friends , who committed themselves to place their words on the basis of their death , knew very well that they did a high political action . &quot;
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic illustration .
&quot; Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus , the importance of the statue changed , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writing h@@ itch R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ con@@ serv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
&quot; at this point , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here . &quot;
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often aw@@ ful journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not shine the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ res &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland there is something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her chapter speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in was great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver@@ meda@@ ill@@ en@@ gew@@ inner , who will compete in their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 m barrier , says it is &quot; unbeliev@@ able &quot; that 16 ball@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Schot@@ t@@ lands so far best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the medium @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads this way and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man that one should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell team .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; very proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being special about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates chose me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who are part of the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as an established ath@@ l@@ ete , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech as a captain is concerned ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to put on this home support and profit from it that we are back in the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on again .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking Cri@@ tics About Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the heating of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers killed him because of everything , from domestic politics to political principles . &quot;
&quot; he cho@@ os@@ ed in the criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not put his cri@@ tic into silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ ckey &apos;s staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the Gover@@ nor dism@@ is@@ sed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like h@@ og@@ an .
this is a repub@@ li@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reac@@ tionary war@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rig@@ orous compliance with the principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and playing his hair @-@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or braces or h@@ asser@@ ted people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ ckey &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not br@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the governor was designated as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; , &quot; would probably call others &quot; inter@@ ces@@ sion . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a cri@@ tic or a negative comment is deleted .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als , or to arrest or to silence prot@@ esters . &quot;
but this is exactly what happened digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise that he compla@@ ins Facebook and other social media .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County was the last A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er on their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ ly between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ers hit his lead . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; the peti@@ tions that critic@@ ised the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have it to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Ra@@ ffer@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organis@@ es the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who took links to the end of the last year at the Ar@@ cher@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament amb@@ assador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Ra@@ ffer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is an eager advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Englis@@ h@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to def@@ ending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I won &apos;t be able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on home soil . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it went so far .
&quot; the trio in the field are the former master winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior major champ@@ ions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup Captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Schot@@ ten in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Drum@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary canc@@ elling through passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) have come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking , &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;

hous@@ ings turn out to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ ing@@ strasse are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in the times &quot; , &quot; thus the head of the court Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of hous@@ ings , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noticed in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which continuously hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the company &apos;s rep@@ utable . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses were allowed to drive through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ ore from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; Mar@@ vin Kost@@ ore tells . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
&quot; when B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , it does not use a cook@@ er . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai County in the uns@@ ett@@ led Indones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the carbon@@ ized tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with drinking water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless area serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which was stir@@ red for the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta that maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ di@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent portion of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that were transformed by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ian have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no aliens . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skir@@ t . &quot;
&quot; before we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is a poor@@ est province in Indonesia , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has declined in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua also boasts wood resources valued at 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; according to the number of activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua had been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and im@@ pris@@ oned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tri@@ bal countries in the 1970 @-@ s were genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we value everything &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - ra@@ pe and electro@@ cr@@ ashes are particularly popular according to another report - and brutal supp@@ ression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week happen inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bolts have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but demo@@ graphic developments are changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the population @-@ rich islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p cant@@ e@@ ens sell ro@@ asted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to take part in this .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , moved to the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market .
&quot; the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and inf@@ rin@@ gements of Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 District of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the pres@@ idential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols off a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch their spot@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers gave rise to their sound , and later returned to four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ asing and struck the group with their ri@@ bs , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission was set alight and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center in order to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial j@@ ou@@ ghts and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - im@@ i@@ tising in the circle and im@@ i@@ tising a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent a command of an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TIME document that has not been released to local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the por@@ ch of his colorful be@@ aming wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indones@@ ian , bears only one name , the TIME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the police insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the kill@@ ings news came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Security Wir@@ anto , in October 2016 , said that he instit@@ uted an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the closure of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be under@@ going , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke in Jak@@ arta with TIME on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Tar@@ anto , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed over 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been laid aside , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led to such asser@@ tions with fier@@ ce un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear later years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ce@@ ased .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he fis@@ cated in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company headquarters .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers thre@@ w stones on officers , re@@ acting on them by def@@ ying warning shots . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injuries were quickly arrived here , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police bri@@ gade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strength@@ ens the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( op@@ m ) , the re@@ bel army , cla@@ iming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by cont@@ acting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ op@@ m leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into cu@@ sto@@ dy , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive back again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tra@@ gic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot;
the few work@@ places that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and weal@@ thier immigrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no job or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tri@@ bal Council . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , international media coverage restrictions remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were depor@@ ted for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s elec@@ toral campaign , the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal , and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neigh@@ bors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting . &quot;
the same countries have historically regarded the op@@ m .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right mess@@ enger K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and ur@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the meeting , but wanting to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another pres@@ idential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not be voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ victims led to the last symbolic act of the de@@ fi@@ ance : the victims of an sacrifice were buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they will never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire which , in just two years , swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) acci@@ dentally . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the alarm alarm and scre@@ aming of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; told an inhabit@@ ant who called his name George Ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units were ext@@ ingu@@ ished at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said that it is working on providing accommodation for those concerned .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des in June , where about 80 people died . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his great Davis Cup coup at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup single was only supported by two winning sets for this sport , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so highly este@@ emed five @-@ pack classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the job .
&quot; at all , not until the vote , after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to place the final in a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host @-@ right in the next round in the next round .
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be reli@@ eved and the players will have to do less official media dead@@ lines before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 passengers sends forbidden objects to the aircraft , finding out a pol@@ l &quot;
&quot; a survey among air passengers concluded that more than 20 percent were aware of or un@@ consciously prohibited items on the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore b@@ anned kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had been late discovered that they had travel@@ ed with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted with more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet @-@ charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travelers are more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents who admitted that they were know@@ ingly trying to fly with something that was b@@ anned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
the most common items that have been deliberately caused by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent gave up to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the women respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought pro@@ hibited drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was asking travelers across the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods had brought through the airport safety , and how many would have been inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people , the most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly wear - by safety , those who are most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids you are allowed to take with or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids con@@ fis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; flu@@ ids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la model 3 .
&quot; so far , he has under@@ gone that part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ umph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less brilliant figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , sp@@ ati@@ fied mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders could be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ 0,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500,000 be , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to the mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a model 3 today may anticip@@ ate delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum load capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to larger delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt draws from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules for reducing emissions
&quot; a day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air@@ borne poll@@ ut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a German occupation court .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran for states on October 1 , to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulation , which opp@@ ose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the withdrawal of regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Labour Court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply increased the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ l@@ ment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for the execution and then waited to be charged by activists and others in an agreement , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who de@@ pl@@ agu@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA stated that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ outs &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive version of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft bill approved in the last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet implemented in the Senate yet .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states accused the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil Oz@@ on arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on p@@ opping surprising course changes .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government , to turn to environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;

&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubil@@ ee of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery @-@ site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and suppor@@ ter of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique rural jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the present parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the former parish church , the wording of the document was also a glorious farm belonging to the church or patron and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as described in the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village picture of Tum@@ bling , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement core of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 confirm these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ al law arose from the early medieval property law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , stat@@ ing and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church . &quot;
this connected the right to use a priest or propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two b@@ ells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ater of the two crus@@ hed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was first heard in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bell units were stolen .
the roof was le@@ ak@@ y .
17@@ 96 French troops enc@@ amped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche has broken off .
only the church tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm out@@ dated the church tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken down . &quot;
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still existing today remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .

association wants to appro@@ ve the approval of wind wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned towards the land council . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to appro@@ ve its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the time in Vier@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , a few days before , but the district government in Düsseldorf was not authorized because of a form@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval of approval remains un@@ lawful and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : the City Council again decided to break the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permission of the district government is still pending .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the call .
&quot; the corresponding letter entered the circle of Vier@@ sen for past week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argument of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four per 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , where the town of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this is equivalent to approximately one fifth of the power requirement of all four @-@ year households . &quot;
the new re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ hagen gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ nich near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashed : woman dies in a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded fat@@ ally .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the provin@@ cial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich , with her car in the context of the accompanying driver , drove the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot;
city and tra@@ ders are planning &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ Week@@ end
bad Langen@@ feld and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract locals to the shopping tour .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will raise the customers for what offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; consequently , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their appren@@ tic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite to the &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; thus , the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive city centre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers , such as the first &quot; Leisure Day , &quot; for the well @-@ held Sunday , discussions with all the tra@@ des and hosts , in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for satur@@ day and rel@@ oc@@ ating on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be new or more developed . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end everyone would have to contribute to anim@@ ate the city centre , to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; managed to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly spread , was told King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; &quot; Heimat @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , take part in five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; promote the este@@ em of local trade and make its meaning stronger for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment even with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump used over @-@ backed tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned mar@@ ginal wall .
&quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he had publicly den@@ oun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his pres@@ idential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to allow Mexico to pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was adopted by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : milit@@ ants , rac@@ ist act act as a call for justice &quot;
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , shr@@ inking onto the Ford Bridge by Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a needle @-@ suit @-@ suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the prisoners ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n ---- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
&quot; luck@@ ily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience cast very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizen rights to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - came from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 year old former congress dep@@ uty of the Georgia State and a life @-@ long civil rights .
&quot; for him , the post@@ ure serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an inj@@ us@@ tice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosec@@ ution , we want completion , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court medi@@ ator puts a blank@@ et on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades , Ci@@ tiz@@ ens say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always well @-@ known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia enabled the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time , at the pres@@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black farmer ten@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore , did not come from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they went away from prison and closer to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; conclu@@ des an F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a con@@ spiracy between state and local criminal prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage massac@@ re , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual review of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , gri@@ pping and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many believe that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and even harder to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to listen to what I have gone through . &quot;
&quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of bl@@ acks - entered a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well rehear@@ sed summary of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and ur@@ ges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona said the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time said &apos; n --- er &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black actors &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly then the energy shi@@ fts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship re@@ places the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy trying to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene once again begins .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona said the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cl@@ othed with a mour@@ ning dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays sorry &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is travel@@ ed from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ an overwhelming moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sw@@ inging . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to get closer and inspect the dead name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding bodies and whis@@ pers to each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw out the ly@@ e rope and wi@@ pe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w emb@@ raced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona surro@@ unds two of his fellow players , and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience will sit together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white couple from Atlanta chat about the reproduction with a black couple that they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ g@@ led to find words which feel the performance left behind .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks Hof holds at his table , eating and remin@@ is@@ cent of civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a way inspiring as it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of giant , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;

&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;

and then I wonder@@ ed what are you doing .
&quot; a social year , since there is an insight , you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different sites during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the old home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
do you want to report this message ?
&quot; Hi , of course this post is genu@@ in@@ ely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blog@@ ging . thanks . Od@@ po@@ ve@@ da@@ ť &quot;
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager that has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and did you have no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so is life . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts other 3.000 jobs and shor@@ tens the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut down its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company faces . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , the job market director John Fall@@ on pre@@ mier@@ ed predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction in a third cost reduction programme by another 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House in Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.0@@ 5 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul Con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed by su@@ icide bom@@ bing
&quot; a su@@ icide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were viol@@ ated , declar@@ ing an explanation of NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , there were also three civilians in the Q@@ ab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ bing is the last violent act that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Ira@@ qi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of N@@ ato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing power of the Tali@@ ban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a su@@ icide coach killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack on the country , since the US @-@ led forces pushed the Tali@@ ban on power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; force under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump weigh@@ s the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns to dec@@ eler@@ ation of the smo@@ g rule by lam@@ ents
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of Obama &apos;s government , after which states are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the step of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with us and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA Chef Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which sections of the country must be measured in order to meet stringent air quality standards , in order to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards , in order to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump aims to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and conservation groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants community @-@ space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the local council of Flu@@ orn win@@ egro@@ wers appro@@ ves the establishment of a shared space in the future retirement community . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the estate is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although there will still be the area belonging to the church community until now , there is no planning requirement for the project undertaken by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion with regard to a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the community suspended such a community space not as a meeting place for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ ous living , but openly in the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be disp@@ uted by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal space would be , thus reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the suggestion of the decision to sign@@ alize the investor that in this regard it is not possible to throw any ni@@ p@@ ples between the legs , determining that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the environment - as well as the console roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , &quot; &quot; Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer &quot; &quot; means not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously , it happens to the body . &quot;
this is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t get so right , but now you lean on the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am strug@@ gling with it . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger is essential for the community space , but absolutely opposed to a community involvement . &quot;
it looks behind a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy on weal@@ thy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no allowance , but get a real , in the case of doubt a market@@ able equivalent value , the counter @-@ speech is . &quot;
&quot; at Sta@@ ig@@ s &apos;s request to ple@@ dge the decision , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; it remains with two votes in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
col@@ lision with car : wheel@@ ler is thrown down on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured and seriously injured on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath by car . &quot;
&quot; as the police told , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ feld had been on the road with his bicycle on the cycle path of the Schwar@@ zer road towards Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road on the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch road .
a passenger car driver granted to him in the same direction .
&quot; when the Langen@@ hagen was driving on the road , he obviously did not know about the traffic . &quot;
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought to a hospital with a re@@ tainer car .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first part of the new season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the def@@ ending champion in the Super@@ cup against the winner .
&quot; in front of the super cup of the German Football World Cup , Bayern Munich will always be bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ab@@ stain from David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the confirmed Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory play of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts fans to their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
wander@@ ing in the Harz from Stern to Stern
&quot; in the Harz region , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created throughout Germany . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the information needs of many visitors , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and sporty performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six places &quot; in the upper har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in@@ quiries came to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be comple@@ mented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile telephone reception plays a role in the selection of location . &quot;
accessibility is also a crit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the path is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the club . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star bri@@ ghter than another , even though it is much far@@ ther away . &quot;
&quot; also , in what con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the St. Andre@@ as@@ berg mountain town , which is the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , in the university town , there are something similar to the planned star@@ base - Plan@@ etary Trail since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the Ha@@ in@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ ter@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Gemeinde Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ ems with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the exact 75 meters of the sun measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
&quot; the march to the next Fix@@ ed Star , however , would last half a year . &quot;
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were in a col@@ lision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light weight champion , went down the cor@@ ridor to gre@@ et Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ weight Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through un@@ anim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ com@@ missions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple presented for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I asc@@ ended to Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 po@@ und debut this year in order to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed himself openly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he rated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; a huge fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday combat . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side is very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could sense the moment@@ um , which arose for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top war@@ ri@@ ors , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded to tire bur@@ ners
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously injured in an accident on A7 . &quot;
&quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the passenger fell to the right into the emb@@ ank@@ ment , where he was over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed and then lying on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was closed towards the north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the improvement of the defense formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first race of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was content , with the result as well , would not have been the two opposing players at the 2 : 2 vs. Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ erk@@ ets should be further optimized .
&quot; and a gate after a kick @-@ off , the For@@ tun@@ en will no longer want to catch up . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the tri@@ une chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just been able to build up the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ elmann who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; prerequisite is , but that we do better harmon@@ ize and we do not make so many ab@@ norm@@ alities in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one can speak after a draw from a failed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; the start of the season I first judged after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the play of Sax@@ onia in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a bad weather . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they couldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a promotion favourite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland play a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we have the claim to come amongst the first six is stup@@ id , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is only positive in only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum seek@@ ers published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for Foren@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) has started conducting the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , you should take a closer look at the age of the age after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ rat@@ ory verk@@ et ) has been cri@@ tici@@ zed for errors in jud@@ ging the correct age of some refugees who were at least three years old . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration sales have sent 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; &quot; possibly 18 years or older &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person was &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , of the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steadily improved over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no major difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 581 findings , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson , of the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , however def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is minimal . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , and in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Director at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Reg@@ ulations Committee of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three refur@@ bis@@ hed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a rain@@ bow bridge made of concrete , coated with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other bridges , it is now in the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refur@@ bis@@ hed . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge @-@ cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a border fix@@ ation , which is also used as a way of operation . &quot;
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge cover is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian path should be run out .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge @-@ caps .
particular finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ ing over the project .
fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans first had to be caught .
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated single @-@ lane by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked . &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful Prot@@ est with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties pull at one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the volcanic Eifel Tower ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) are part of a broad alliance that marks a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D invites to a &quot; &quot; great election campaign &quot; &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a bun@@ ny picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forums One World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; original German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did Af@@ D actually arrive on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel says he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listen@@ ers in the hall that await the pres@@ idency of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; more than one hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move away - no special inci@@ dents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; with the Wolf@@ acher trump@@ ets Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there is a series of Has@@ la@@ cher &apos;s mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian tro@@ mp@@ ter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to cross not only the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; thus Johann Sebastian Bach works with the two as in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; combined with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classic , jazz and the free playing to a fascinating overall artwork . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ kirche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart all about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; if I bite once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably best known relation of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who was ultimately bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brunette performer is insured against the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I loved every seriously I have dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I didn &apos;t like it to be taken seriously .
especially among them she suffered from &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but at school time when she rather dressed like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me odd , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia . I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor .
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and has inher@@ ited a carbon store by his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening when it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than working to make our country great again .
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , inspiring message , &quot; said S &amp; D President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of Athletics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ises on Thursday what he described as an apparent exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed . &quot;
&quot; Russian Athletics chief Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yla@@ kh@@ un said during the I@@ A@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said it was sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were taken away in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments , the I@@ A@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e to the Repor@@ ters . &quot;
the entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive tag , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the world champ@@ ionships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the head of the I@@ A@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug testing is still in@@ adequate and prohibited coach is still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; at a fun@@ eral service in the north @-@ Hes@@ sian region of F@@ ritz@@ lar , about 1,000 people of the two soldiers have thought about a helic@@ opter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; for the un@@ resolved issue , Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they described the two pil@@ ots , but as &quot; &quot; benef@@ ici@@ aries of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before this su@@ preme sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Sta@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann in Nord@@ h@@ essen had died a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death test of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the Church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that began the fun@@ eral celebration in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; there were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general insp@@ ector of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the gro@@ mm@@ s laid down ro@@ ses , the members of the family were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann had built the flight operation of the helic@@ opter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pil@@ ots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to whom the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if the crew could not turn down the crash , nobody could have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen said not : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; for a country , of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the fun@@ eral the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any statements . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already produced a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , and she called it further in the message . &quot;
&quot; when Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to reign .
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also re@@ places the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ mahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not have the title and function he wanted , he did not see his wife as equivalent - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the leader of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility family , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always fle@@ w , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the trademark of soci@@ o @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for a night . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Minister @-@ President Wei@@ l aims to swi@@ ft re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is not going to reti@@ re after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country . &quot;
he said on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprise of a Gre@@ ens M@@ EPs from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green Dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ west established their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency district in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire Bj@@ örn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants his faction to pick them up .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ üm@@ el said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether or not they could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l holds it irre@@ plac@@ eable that the Diet resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that Parliament &apos;s parliament with@@ draws trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be checked law@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all the questions will be discussed if they are legally valid . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the dism@@ al de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land mandate .
&quot; as a matter of course , we assume that she has received her country mandate which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; shared the Managing Director Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel &apos;s Green Party said : &quot; &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ thwest extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in the content , we cannot compre@@ hend this step . &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green Members El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as a tre@@ ach@@ ery .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the head of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian , &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in her fru@@ stration , has her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; says SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and tries to hit it political capital .

&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ ison control , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses the contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers be protected ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt : how can the consumer protect himself from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to all we know at the moment , a health haz@@ ard is virtually impossible . &quot;
do Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really noticed by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of federal states .
&quot; in spite of this , my house has switched off immediately and has been in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries since announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; in the same way , the trade has to ensure that the sold @-@ out products are market@@ able and health @-@ harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if the level of resi@@ due is exceeded 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg , these are non @-@ traffic . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current knowledge of knowledge , the production companies do not meet any immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they must count on the alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
as always there is too little controllers in the seri@@ ousness .
is it only lacking in personnel or in conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
&quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is precisely why a consistent enligh@@ tenment of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors , in cases where crimes can occur , are of decisive significance . &quot;
I have already made a clear clari@@ fication of the fact that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to obtain only safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food sector , consumers are ri@@ ghtly indi@@ gn@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; by means of the ar@@ mor@@ ed means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ de Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ giving animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be worked consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football have an impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will be coming to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to bid teams from access to the prestigious champion League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEF@@ A 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point , that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to get the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PSG can make money loose with certainty , to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must be able to counter@@ act the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business with legitimate income sources . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous deb@@ ts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the deb@@ ts of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder affair .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in the United Kingdom in 2015 , his successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to frigh@@ ten from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , leaving the sum of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ board their financial supervision by connecting their income through companies associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ act could sponsor the PSG , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PSG @-@ payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come into Qatar on payments of the Organiz@@ ing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
&quot; however , PSG and Qatar have argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be amb@@ assador and such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easily identified . &quot;
&quot; the former pen@@ alties against PSG indicate that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , every attempt to take into account the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PSG on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG @-@ situation .
the latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey acquis@@ itions . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s displac@@ ement by cla@@ iming that PSG would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial Dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s final ownership . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Butter@@ fly , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new tool supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has produced for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet co @-@ operation is faced with a potential end : the airline re@@ writes the contract . &quot;
Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ scrap confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on request by the news agency .
&quot; according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaging panels of 14 grams are distributed per year before landing on passengers .
Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; the industry in@@ sider evalu@@ ates the volume of the order according to &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achiev@@ es an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a shot maker it is a prestigious job .
&quot; as many applicants are on the new call , the Swiss will not want to be betra@@ yed . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract over spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement . &quot;
cho@@ col@@ ates spread the Swiss on board their flights since 2006 .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets before the Swiss completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as Fran@@ chise , it feels like time would be scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ or ( it contained an original story for an attractive can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ ff@@ ening to the core of the g@@ ags - middle aged actors play cool children who will grow up , they nevertheless managed to gain the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the heat . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point sticks a character through an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able Coop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random ins@@ anity that could he@@ ur this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West W@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , speci@@ alizes in being a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard Scottish Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Cor@@ n@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dialog@@ ues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV how Americans may do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find the voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective is so deeply involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it often plays a single role . &quot;
&quot; there are six long epis@@ odes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited on a lower length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef ever visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a b@@ unch of ham@@ burger . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to hit the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office Con@@ stance lasted on Friday . &quot;
15 complaints were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and were already warran@@ ted to arrest warran@@ ts .
&quot; in addition , the officials ordered large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the promotion .
&quot; overall , over 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Maf@@ ia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has established Con@@ stance against organised drug traff@@ i@@ cking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;

&quot; according to a report , the foreigners regi@@ sters in Germany have significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some grave mal@@ ign@@ ations in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has reported to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register register . &quot;
&quot; defic@@ ien@@ cies in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , warned in an analysis present in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the Register , according to the data , ten million people are recorded with foreign citizenship , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently well maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; er@@ ron@@ eous data input can slow down recur@@ ring processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of tax@@ able people , the EU citizens are seized , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; but such false assign@@ ments led &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with out@@ lining &quot; , &quot; i.e. , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they have travel@@ ed from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rück newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it says that BA@@ MF is conducting such processes &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was on the ground under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees who first reach it . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant is traveling to another EU country , this state can return it to the country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason@@ ing , the Office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ person of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening illegal recording conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donation service for other people .
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were hon@@ oured on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with its now 100 donations , has meanwhile distributed 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community recogni@@ zes multi@@ ples read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the Council of the Council . &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ously how our bodies are created for it and we respect the don@@ ors resp@@ ecting their blood for stran@@ gers , nor to do so un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ hein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the circle of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; in previous years , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ lau@@ ght were among the multi@@ lin@@ ens and were awarded for each 50 performed blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tamar@@ a Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spend ten times each 500 milli@@ liters of her life juice . &quot;
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation about an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying print . &quot;
&quot; the polic@@ y@@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members to raise an increase in this month as the weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that inflation would continue to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation of pre@@ heated inflation , and she said that credit costs could rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut business package , which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that now they will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s predic@@ ted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the po@@ und fell to this news against the dollar and the euro .
the po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations for an interest rate , and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low sal@@ ary increases , as the sharpen@@ ing gets worse at first before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent the income gap in the next few years , &quot; &quot; but she added that wages were &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; to recover at the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumer spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , causing the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the last ruling of the Bank on interest rates , the call for interest rates had increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ displac@@ ed households , whereby three policy makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has decreased from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be attra@@ cting it in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the exce@@ ed@@ ance in proportion to their goal of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ ess , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the len@@ ders are still looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing de@@ als are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages disappear , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;

patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after the High Court in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ posi@@ tional phy@@ la@@ xe ( pre@@ p ) recorded before the sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by some 86 percent , is now supplied by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed the verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional phy@@ lo@@ sis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduced the HIV transmission at risk of infection .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a veter@@ in@@ arian can also register for a possible participation in their local sexu@@ ality clinic .
the programme will be CHF 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence , how it is used on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in which more than three decades lasting progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
pre@@ p when target@@ ing targeted and endanger@@ ed people offers the possibility to alter the English HIV epide@@ mic .
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
&quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly done throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of late delay and rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , turned into a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ ghts@@ bridge . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ ghts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an me@@ zz@@ anine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms together , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the me@@ zz@@ anine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored at both ends to make it work longer .
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kit@@ chens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is mutual , so that when you push the door very easily slide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here they succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and raised squar@@ emet@@ rics of something standard@@ ly in something amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in a debate about one of the largest real estate empire Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation occurs in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Jeans family founded je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 single trade stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Colin - described by Paul as the &quot; Princip@@ al Oper@@ ator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the corporate assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Colin has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Colin have left him behind what I was holding for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Colin ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ ida@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ ida@@ v@@ its , emails and reports of companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick during the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
&quot; Colin says he began West@@ co when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 were hoping to add their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis corporate group , whereas Colin claims that mark of leaving the company paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; said Paul &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation has become bitter . &quot;
Colin has held back very well although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin rep@@ lied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have will@@ ed that Paul and I would end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; he said , added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Colin wrote . &quot;
j@@ umps of new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss at a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first working day with leading employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House that he wanted to repair : poor information getting into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship to television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ad@@ fast praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter &apos;s hab@@ it has ever been under control is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his colleagues managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently hin@@ dered it that tr@@ ump checking out contro@@ vers@@ y .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ maker :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts like a volcan@@ o , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president mal@@ ign@@ ant a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; being the source behind a b@@ unch of le@@ aks &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for chic@@ ane , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ maker added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population is wor@@ shipped and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after crimin@@ als are not well @-@ known , information from the population will be hoped and requested . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from the winter .
&quot; the experience had shown that many cur@@ sory notes were hiding on holiday destinations , was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for wanted crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online convi@@ ctions have been arrested , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the mar@@ ches of mar@@ ches , which have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch from the community to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought up horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense lines and pushed its vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry citizens have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous visitor said , &quot; They are drag@@ ged there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they thre@@ w stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are back again . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my congreg@@ ations if the Council cannot stop it even .
&quot; an inhabit@@ ant who did not want to be named , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our references , it is very important that as many people as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling on 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the Court must examine , when we present our case . &quot;
Birken@@ hof will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
&quot; the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof through the former Ambiente Oper@@ Gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenue was also due to the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rats@@ amt as a collective accommodation , which provided contro@@ vers@@ y discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
&quot; however , above all Freuden@@ stadt Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ en@@ hotels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary au@@ ctions in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you will be Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a longer period of time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is done . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings are partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; very bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery dr@@ aus . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to set itself wide , Sch@@ erer explains . &quot;
&quot; single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Krau@@ se have already led so sha@@ vers .
the ideas of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor installations are also placed on the front , which is clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Mon@@ key : us @-@ Special In@@ spec@@ tor pres@@ upp@@ oses Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the committee recorded the work in the past weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with reference to people who were familiar with the matter . &quot;
the newspaper adverti@@ sed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
CN@@ N reported that there was already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ äl@@ test@@ em son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 pres@@ idential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps elec@@ toral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men should stand who acted as advis@@ er to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also received more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and exam@@ ines the repro@@ ach whether the President possibly hin@@ ders the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys &apos;s main task is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Cham@@ bers .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversi@@ al cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite persons to the hearing under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N transmitter , demonstrations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former Elec@@ toral Committee Paul Man@@ a@@ fort attended the conversation . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , legal experts told us that the enforcement show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening in order to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ or , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement , he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House endor@@ se any action that accelerated the work of the special medi@@ ator in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after fired Com@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; because of this ration@@ ale , alle@@ g@@ ations were made against Tr@@ ump , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump had asked him to set up investigations against the former national security advis@@ or Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and his staff . &quot;
un@@ solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair with the later rec@@ ited President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idency of the pres@@ idency of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of repub@@ li@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented law@@ makers on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ er could no longer be dism@@ is@@ sed so easily . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ice @-@ mountain ranges from the scar@@ let seven @-@ fold size of Berlin . &quot;
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated over a Bil@@ lion metric tons and 58@@ 00 square kilometres to the north and will probably need two , three years until it was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for man does not go out of him .
&quot; according to research data , it is un@@ clear to what extent climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg . &quot;
&quot; however , there have been a series of unusual co@@ qu@@ arri@@ es in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ simile basis . &quot;
according to many researchers this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ file .
&quot; it is s@@ wimm@@ ers in the sea , and is fed by great glaci@@ ers . &quot;
it therefore continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
&quot; to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed some years ago . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ file is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece is cut off at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ eis and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after melting . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the arc causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , writes the British research project to observe Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ file is the fourth largest shelf @-@ file of Ant@@ arc@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; at the passage from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists we argu@@ ed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back and possibly collap@@ sing , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researcher does not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , a lot of ice @-@ animals in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have collap@@ sed over the past few decades . &quot;
this long tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to the data of the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; in the last 50 years , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has been around three degrees warmer and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants front @-@ tari@@ ff at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U demands to come out of the employers &quot; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have been un@@ covered . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
17 appren@@ tices now have their first day of work behind them .
the appren@@ tic@@ es@@ hips at the circle are apparently very popular .
around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places that were in vain for this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle still l@@ acks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies in the district M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG on the working day and face the short@@ age of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented of the application defic@@ it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , to show concrete measures for trans@@ former cli@@ m@@ bers and involve a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that they did not know before .
other towns promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is from a &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service from illness or age . &quot;
so it &apos;s time to act so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Erd@@ og@@ an , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long ago in the circle of work for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly ques@@ tioned the personnel expenses , and the rest of the parties were ast@@ o@@ unding . &quot;
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satis@@ factory solution at short notice , the county government should strive with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a house @-@ ari@@ f , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually sees the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money , if you switch to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ gel@@ e and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Bo@@ ots
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had con@@ fis@@ cated a boat from the German Relief Organisation &quot; &quot; youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; because their crew had worked effectively with traff@@ i@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , refused to express itself to the detailed proposals of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only evaluate all the accus@@ ations currently being collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , super@@ vised since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew takes inf@@ lat@@ able migrants on board , which are delivered directly by human traff@@ i@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go down so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was claimed only 1.3 miles off the Liby@@ an coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of imposing itself over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all , have to have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to remember the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign themselves , Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ates @-@ organization doctors are without limits ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had decreased dramatically in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an Coast Guard and cooperation with the local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further discussions with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
ascent and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin outer post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region , for four days to enjoy trim and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim Valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream layers . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were again and again long asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;

&quot; again , the look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; fle@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days many altitude metres were announced .

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after 173 km and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - met . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equipment@@ t for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer con@@ soles , rather than fighting in wind and weather over the stadium racing ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal state associations , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain , &quot; that there are still a number of clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; on the next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organiz@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Eind@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year @-@ olds , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations tried to con@@ quer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be much more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft to Asia once a year . &quot;
what &apos;s the right thing about ?
&quot; e @-@ Sport will focus on computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in the normal sport , they have long been established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
and in the Asian Games 2022 e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many people the idea is surely getting used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that you also find in the classic sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; rob@@ ber@@ y also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; checks should be heavily fe@@ a@@ sible for online gaming , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ aktive Enter@@ tain@@ software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts rapid growth in E @-@ Sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , that is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers . &quot;
international are many countries already far@@ ther .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the U.S. team N@@ RG e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ cr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football first le@@ ague associations , according to Dut@@ t , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B managing director R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but to al@@ ign the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; there you can &apos;t cling to it , that only when football is all the way it was . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy ur@@ ged to su@@ icide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June for a neg@@ ligent murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and facing down , when she was sentenced . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they regret absolutely .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; &quot; no day , in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will bear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person to have with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ ison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the event attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text announ@@ cements that they encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , pier@@ ce yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the fall by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who def@@ ended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion and help , not j@@ ail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
08.11.2015 &#124; Desperate Housewives
FC Bayern tr@@ umps a big season with the Con@@ fed Cup winner - Extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ mir immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer had to be seen , he stopped his arm at his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the deposit could have been better than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but Kim@@ mir was able to interpret the sign of the coach .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen by youth players , deb@@ unk@@ ers and just out of holiday pro@@ s existing C @-@ el@@ f was chosen as a guide , but he . &quot;
sugar is most prefer@@ able to those with a lot of tru@@ ths that you want to keep in a mood .
those who were chosen to commen@@ ce the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; Kim@@ mir confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fli@@ ck@@ ering over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot;
&quot; right behind , that is now his position , the white bar@@ k on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ mich took part in this formation as the one who can best take the helm in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ cl@@ amped tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
&quot; Vi@@ dal therefore , to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( collap@@ sed little ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches on the devil coming out to the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( fol@@ dable only ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le there@@ with , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot not neg@@ atively fall down . &quot;
date : 06 / 13 / 2009 Size :
&quot; Sü@@ ll ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the rep@@ utable Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ ll tried a few times in the game @-@ building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not what we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the dé@@ but .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Ru@@ dy was not one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goo@@ dbye to some cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you simply have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ eled Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V enquiry about changes in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ els the old minister .
&quot; Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing att@@ aches the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the turn@@ around sees N@@ atus in infrastructure policy : the exit of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um geh@@ ammer in Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Tourist Board . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Foreign Affairs at Cornelia Hol@@ tmann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) of Trier endeav@@ ours to stimulate sales in supermarkets , and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish a company &apos;s own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional inc@@ en@@ tive for young tra@@ inees in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is en@@ vis@@ aged for the passed championship and 2500 Euros , if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains however long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quickly facts to create , at the same time lacking the land on the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to set mobility in state @-@ owned mobility . &quot;
the Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; Christian Bald@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U vice @-@ president refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of provin@@ cial roads . &quot;
Frank N@@ atus also expects a concept of the country to address the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; in addition , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also not@@ ori@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the rating 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ in about additional Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics at the moment and is still in the super@@ visory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she cleared the field after four months because of discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer the software to upgrade in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chair said that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to ensure compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles , also absor@@ b what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of indul@@ ging the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , there is a raft through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go to Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge . &quot;
&quot; and that is not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the part of the project will be clari@@ fied .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a gar@@ bage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True love , &quot; the understanding of the is@@ ar should shar@@ pen as a worthy flow of wild . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft ran over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and actions to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ erns , and laughter against the suffering &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at the time one of the most widely published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the rab@@ bits of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still drawing and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ iller@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he was among other things as dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ul@@ ators - which fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough ended at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
&quot; even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans . &quot;
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , rounded mur@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table today , works nearly ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; calendar , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to be widely distributed worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er as an opponent .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he rather uses the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is decre@@ asing due to conditions remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought and insects that are committed to diseases , which scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil does not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are taken into consideration include better water distribution and slow@@ ing down ev@@ ap@@ oration from soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thuring@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the point of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
&quot; merchants , guil@@ ds , tra@@ ders , vag@@ ants or a land register are to be experienced in the city centre on these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own trage@@ dy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ r@@ als , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings reach . &quot;
&quot; there are drug traff@@ i@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are sk@@ inn@@ ed , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to started his office in December 2012 . 589 stands up for attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss about their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a son@@ der advoc@@ ate was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings have been initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug traff@@ i@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely brought to justice by journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provin@@ cial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated as &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &apos; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , broken with the blame , that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , who pres@@ umed gang@@ members also bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave Val@@ dez for the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper served a reputation for cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard work without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , wherever it took . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ i@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead men ... why did you not tell us what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse as a do@@ ck@@ man , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine of his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced her to question her own assump@@ tions about how best to do her job , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly , keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; sm@@ ells a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative mu@@ g@@ gling rou@@ ghts , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the space where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside looking for two polic@@ emen protected from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the jo@@ ke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers who were not trust@@ worthy of the governor . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are fac@@ to under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce left three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the public spending which concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the public prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local from drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incident in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Kh@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months before , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the Western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become more lou@@ der than they have written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez indic@@ ted the authorities to sp@@ y journalists and to leave them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is once again shared by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , participating government officials and a &quot; &quot; indiffer@@ ent society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blank@@ et with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media guard group &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were placed next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue on how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z spoke publicly to the cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want about us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug traff@@ i@@ cking is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce were sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer when all their phones began to sum@@ mar@@ ise . &quot;
a series of shooting fights with ri@@ bb@@ les and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ en he@@ ul@@ tes near to - a further fo@@ undry in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a look at the polic@@ emen , who kept watch to see if they were in read@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce staff followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; as you can only remember , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day when J@@ avier was mur@@ dered , the tra@@ inees asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have discovered that the first findings of the unbeliev@@ able r@@ hin@@ o horn of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has start@@ led researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you smile only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and res@@ embles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ con@@ dens@@ ation , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed us to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs has made head@@ lines for the first time and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ it@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully . &quot;
the aston@@ ishing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments on his body .
&quot; they discovered counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sur@@ passes by far the animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r of enough pressure was hun@@ ted by meat e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals , who use the sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which indicates that this noise @-@ au@@ rier was subjected to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ ons must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal referring to information about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are likely to be much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , who lived Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ ful ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips hung by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater re@@ funds kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the c@@ logged remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin cr@@ ust still cover up @-@ pri@@ ge tank @-@ plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates carrying the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are moved upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the storm : mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re long st@@ out - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ München ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass Car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first data of the police were at 5 p.m. between the junction boxes Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm about 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no information about the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it is light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re long retreat was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire department noted the signs of the vehicle workers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock another accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a col@@ lision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helic@@ opter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : company test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes one of us or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
credit Card control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available on many other long distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train ticket utilisation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; in order to be able to use this , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
&quot; you also have to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test@@ ers , then a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
&quot; the train companions get a message on their mobile devices , that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y taken . &quot;
&quot; when the train atten@@ d@@ ant arrives at seat Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silence . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train esc@@ ort staff simply check out in the DB Navigator .
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Remote Head of Marketing Management . &quot;
plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by train , know that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket insp@@ ections are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times one has , in any case , one of the fellow travelers , not all the documents necessary for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to assign .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and that is also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not yet released .
how an ac@@ tivis@@ m came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police killed just a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ri@@ vet@@ ed on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns alive body that was stretched out on the street and stayed there four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she turned her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who said a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman told his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; he remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have ac@@ custom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt the ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and res@@ ili@@ ence resulting from the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a rell with her daughter , who carried a cau@@ li@@ flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation that she had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only ac@@ tivis@@ m and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local partner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped them pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly a new type of ac@@ tivis@@ m began to take shape for Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; my ac@@ tivis@@ m changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis president of Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came into mind : &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this sc@@ ep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and res@@ ili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not cent@@ ered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ tivis@@ m rum around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his involvement brought Fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other locals the team led by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that &quot; &quot; movement &quot; &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life as she fell in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , following the killing of black teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Lives@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who poured out this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although it was at the foref@@ ront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the communication cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; she is still cl@@ inging to a chant and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the Bit Gallery moves the people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
&quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say , &quot; &quot; This would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be real great &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need people &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ occupy ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the supporters are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , of which also the other shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
with the start of the construction work it will end .
&quot; the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmers market hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women are always happy again and again . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
but the new project will probably not be very low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping bag in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many stores stand empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , retail stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not tra@@ dable for a re@@ ta@@ iler . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall go there during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or does the gh@@ ost Bit Gallery already manage to sell all stores from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st imposed a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being publicly classified as secret diplomatic reports of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A fitting simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ wife and ground@@ breaking dis@@ si@@ dent , whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which has been extracted from M@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born when he was born in Brad@@ ley Edward but has been openly acqu@@ itted since her pu@@ ber@@ ty on identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 due to 20 charges , including six violations of the sp@@ y law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; in prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wi@@ gs - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette but@@ t and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extra@@ cting the DNA from waste to produce an image of how these people could look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use have become un@@ equal bri@@ bes , which inter@@ changed several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert chel@@ seas judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings dism@@ iss@@ al after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong in the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to further fl@@ aming the rigid divisions he should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning called for M@@ anning with her superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) is an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ acious Mem@@ ories is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is one page of the above @-@ mentioned comic novel . &quot;
&quot; it shows M@@ anning , as it emerg@@ es with a hands @-@ free phone in hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they make your speech cold , then they won . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ eted from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; scanning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be gre@@ eted by the mas@@ ks in the middle of the room , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; it was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nation@@ wide human ch@@ ase is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau .
&quot; the documents say that Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau died 26 , after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a public warning system published by the Chicago Police Department was that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Cor@@ nell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was declared dead on the scene of the event , and Det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that lay@@ them had now been judged and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in touch with the UK police in contact and willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities every possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he ur@@ ged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , rein@@ force themselves , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that were lay@@ men and wareh@@ ouses in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Grand Plaza &apos;s management team released an explanation of the occup@@ ants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will shut the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko &quot;
the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA timet@@ able has been updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA timet@@ able to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ implementation of R@@ USA@@ DA and published recently on the organisation &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the official funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has given up an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the main quarter of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving in the right direction to be deployed again . &quot;

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next hu@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply no consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licens@@ ing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to address special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers permit to handle the C @-@ Suite exec@@ utives and address directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the pursu@@ it of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tool is used by companies to measure employees commitment . &quot;
she said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to s@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low commitments - so that you can drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the job @-@ culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next hu@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken to have been pun@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ allen in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , conver@@ ters lets companies send tailored &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which staff can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has launched converting for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and a simple way to reach their headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company conver@@ ges conver@@ ters , problems that previously were hidden by exec@@ utives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair intern@@ ships can be identified and addressed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that takes the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in finance in February of companies like Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect their jobs more than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s . &quot;
the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors gain y@@ ields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of an enterprise take no measures .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you are asking for more than 4,000 questions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kot@@ ter International , who has seen a lot of information on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you do not follow your employees ask themselves , &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly sales surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better bonding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose your business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the f@@ ry
&quot; it goes on at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ads enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus . &quot;
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a break .
players who are invited to the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed sched@@ ules of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practic@@ ed practical exercises .
&quot; in the course of August 18 , you should keep doing exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the b@@ anding of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many @-@ busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they pl@@ ats up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is over , which is due to the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking place and adjacent Lus@@ kin Centre , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been raised with pe@@ eling , which will be a protective network behind a pe@@ dest@@ al , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I do not worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party fak@@ ers and then show their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ simile verification , which may display results of the invoice verification from the original article . &quot;
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news that many believe that they also influenced the 2016 pres@@ idential elections .
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ ers being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up of the pres@@ idential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be pun@@ ished if they fail to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding what stories are challenged by third parties , people want more contex@@ ts to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his org news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a lock in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and they always smell smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so sm@@ itten with old papers , that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ men on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started to write .
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to worry about the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what possessed , &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all of it ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base into the English story , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ prising that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant insurrection began in this area and I thought , an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher , whom the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years throughout the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell produced from the 18th century , which staged his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making deb@@ ts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying about rich old women - I imagine them as a b@@ unch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise ligh@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write @-@ experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle is vei@@ led in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the wra@@ pping of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ nef started its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want Nelson Art@@ z to keep the logo and slogan at home . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there should be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer &apos;s chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their yesterday un@@ folded web page . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen we know the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
the action is more than just a logo and a slogan .
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able unique selling point . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other commun@@ es . &quot;
in a mean five @-@ digit amount the city of Bad Hon@@ nef will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fears of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on boarding and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine in Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the head of the head of government , the five Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ ers and the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs , took part in the consult@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; thus , civilians in the Y@@ as were in the surplus . &quot;
the government re@@ places the reign@@ s in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the navy were disabled . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of the head Erd@@ og@@ an has fired 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erd@@ og@@ an as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who should have been involved directly in the attempted coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated this week in Ankara . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erd@@ og@@ an had called the fall attempt as &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns due to an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the ab@@ olition of the head@@ scarf ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the great interference in the army and the security forces is at any rate further .
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an ordered another 73@@ 95 Nation@@ als by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ates a targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an especially not @-@ known officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is doubt in the alliance following the pur@@ ges doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump said , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he pre@@ fers to reduce the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries are dealt with Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry aims to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate route for race car shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months , the future of the race car sh@@ utt@@ les had been disp@@ uted - now it should go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is scheduled to be built on the mar@@ ode circuit on which the tourist rail travels . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ steig sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport of the Federal Ministry of Transport , construction works will start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ction the circuit Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ steig , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important connection , &quot; declared Commissioner Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally tuned , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as the operator were already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ steig @-@ Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ steig @-@ Shuttle is a railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ steig .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation in the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested whether the track is used by sufficient many people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the route is also in parts very strong .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t become more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ olls have developed from their inf@@ lat@@ able partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot in accordance with his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ fers have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ rying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine features , the playing on ra@@ pe , when one goes a step to fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah goes , troubled one most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compatible with a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it &apos;s called on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and growing refin@@ ement point to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission to an optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popularity , they remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not stran@@ gely or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has cur@@ tail@@ ed to have sexual ass@@ aults . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the s@@ wollen body and the st@@ ew@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a lea@@ p , but at the moment it does not feel like a great lea@@ p . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with porn star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel in@@ humane that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid
j@@ umps Great Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. elec@@ torate have split up families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ elected relatives .
we are all rep@@ uted to let our filter bags burst .
&quot; less noticed is the power of bringing j@@ umps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ous@@ ins , a left @-@ directed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the repub@@ li@@ can kin@@ ship with which she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is noticeable in another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the imposing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cru@@ el possibility that one day its babies will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear to be an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness at once compared to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ inary version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - both in fact seem to be a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the carousel of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are sk@@ inn@@ y and the animals turn to look full of anxiety over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topics @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magic experience , since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40@@ s and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given it the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my road , it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ use gr@@ inning , while I tired of the experience making her credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain rel@@ oc@@ ated from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he suffered from prison authorities in a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , from which they say they were too cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ ä@@ ss@@ ler from F@@ lange and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and to the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will attend school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus in Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol for the dism@@ iss@@ al , 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle growing in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the hen yard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him broke , and the eagle sp@@ rang up his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank found a p@@ oultry dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders were carrying around the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like chicken .
its purpose is to be free .

&quot; the kitchen time is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only dism@@ iss her students , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ ä@@ ss@@ ler . &quot;

two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were im@@ pris@@ oned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally anch@@ oring people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is running . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have intensi@@ fied the control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
will Diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the emission performance of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
&quot; no , the software updates dealt with are optional . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the che@@ ating software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation over the next few months , but not yet called a precise date . &quot;
Daimler has told you to write every person involved .
&quot; if any inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long should the conversion be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this will depend on manufacturers &apos; commitment as well as political pressure .
&quot; as we have seen , the car manufacturers deliberately do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it can be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do motor@@ cyclists do , who do not car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company ? &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars is threatened now ?
the ACE fears that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving b@@ ans are threatening . &quot;
&quot; in rural areas , there are so far no losses for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the co@@ vet@@ ed awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the scri@@ bes . &quot;
awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced that participation in the g@@ ala will be refra@@ ined from .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ ns me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an under@@ scor@@ ed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify their view .
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life @-@ worth
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the place is already written - suitable applicants are however rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been .
and the work always makes him great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press brief@@ ing .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application needs to be fulfilled with the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , considering the regular periods of termination - there is still enough time for an el@@ aboration . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative community as Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant has to assign corresponding degrees to the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but it is important that the city and its citizens are important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life @-@ worth , &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and his staff . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz are appro@@ ached .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will be be@@ ating with approximately 1.5 million Euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design for a city builder of large play space available .
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and nur@@ sery , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often commen@@ dable by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fit &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the divi@@ ding city builder . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is carrying a great deal of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere but also for the further design of the city .
&quot; according to the city of Has@@ lach , who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should have a completed academic studies as a master engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with the subject of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Municipal Building Department is subject to high and civil engineering , construction management , landsc@@ ap@@ ing , administration of the municipal property , municipal property with building yard and city wall ner@@ ei , as well as the Lower Building Authority , including monuments protection . &quot;
mountain biking is one of the most wonderful outdoor leisure @-@ time activities .
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown valleys had thrown the blue bicycle from the track transfer in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , witnesses had been observed by a pink sco@@ oter and a bicycle rider . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a park in Lausanne , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ators , or the perpet@@ r@@ ators , would have put themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the railway traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delays , and the costs for the rail freight transport , the railway customers could also get to the perpet@@ r@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; sum was said to the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway track could be carried out without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; scar@@ c@@ ely ten people were killed Friday morning , two of them looked at the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , approximately 200 meter of pipes had to be replaced . &quot;
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
&quot; but a new study confirms exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes cr@@ amping and blo@@ ating , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while the suffer@@ ers are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
cells that are able to dis@@ solve inflamm@@ ations are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance stimul@@ ates immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet of toler@@ ant diet toler@@ ates a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el type , if the same system also helps people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study @-@ mice had such cells but another group of the same tribe , which had not had this . &quot;
&quot; it suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component has been puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabol@@ ites known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high levels of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
&quot; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot;
&quot; Manchester United signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of signature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pres@@ e@@ ason game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts on Tuesday , and impressed the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic , however , had been excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia @-@ tour of the blues and only had 45 minutes to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho said . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft maker Bo@@ eing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots fle@@ w from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the US , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new Tief@@ schlag for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD , social democratic prime ministers always looked after elections with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; just no be@@ acon from the party centr@@ alized , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the TR@@ UTH . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were fail@@ ures .
and one after another .
&quot; following the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red green can simply not reliably rule , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction exit of a Gre@@ ens M@@ EPs led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition subsequently lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens Federal Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the dism@@ iss@@ al Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal executive and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true all at all , &quot; &quot; one of the SPD &apos;s TR@@ UTH si@@ gh@@ s , when the new Hi@@ ob message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the emergence of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly sharp defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades settled at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it then became - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te rus@@ hed the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; after that , the comrades looked back in the weeks after that . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just begun new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was coming from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next depression came .
&quot; Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD state head , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in the crisis communication he did so pretty much everything that one can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for his political survival . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; because of the VW @-@ emissions standard and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in the criticism for a long time . &quot;
s@@ ossen@@ damp@@ fer ( 35 )
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l always tried to set acc@@ ents in the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to develop his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the neighbourhood of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; at the same time , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the Party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; for the time being , the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens and above all on the back@@ sliding Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ west .
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ampa puts her own career on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD &apos;s Bundestag faction , the editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jackets is not elected because of her person as a direct candidate , but by the State List of the Lower Saxony Green Party , the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties further . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD @-@ Bundestag faction , compla@@ ins about an &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago the elec@@ torate was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony Social Democratic Party as a candidate to the Bundestag election , to the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ance gels for local nucle@@ us III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives ST@@ EG city development on Wednesday informed them . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 there exist in sens@@ ations of refur@@ bish@@ ment areas .
&quot; at that time , in the Occup@@ ation Zone I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the refur@@ bish@@ ment of previous refur@@ bish@@ ment is a &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; - it is important to also promote interior development and not only to open up new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Karlsruhe government pres@@ idency that there will be a conservation area III . &quot;
&quot; the total amount was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euro came from the country , the rest of the municipality sens@@ ations . &quot;
what is the origin of a refur@@ bish@@ ment area ?
&quot; one will continue to examine Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role in re@@ building interest in the planned area . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area limits could then also be shi@@ fted again . &quot;
&quot; ST@@ eg represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Länder @-@ program &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt , &quot; &quot; in which the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. , per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the ir@@ rig@@ ation period for the funding period has been ongoing until 30 April 20@@ 26 since 1 January 2017 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking would only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill a questionna@@ ire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as soon as possible the order decision should be made , so that the renovation can be started next year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the said preliminary examinations .
it is a matter of evalu@@ ating and deci@@ ding the urban ab@@ norm@@ alities and to decide when to san@@ ction and to what extent .
there will then also be a re@@ mark in the basic book for the respective property .
&quot; once again Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; which deals with the structural condition and the renovation results . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionna@@ ire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; information about size , distribution and occup@@ ants of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if the premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionna@@ ire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , ex@@ h@@ orts first . &quot;
&quot; one could not reserve a subsi@@ dy for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location nucle@@ us II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consulting an@@ aes@@ thes@@ iser in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology res@@ embles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and only takes 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the cost of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers .
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a navy helic@@ opter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , tax@@ pa@@ yers will cost up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter was manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House requested the presence of helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its su@@ peri@@ ors , the dep@@ uty marine man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second squ@@ ad needed for the return flight due to the restriction of the working hours . &quot;
the original air@@ plane was during the event at the helic@@ opter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground .
&quot; from the records made available , it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act pro@@ hi@@ bits federal public ownership for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the atch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the dep@@ uty commander . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impulse to reform the health reform that was under@@ way in the Senate and promoted the efforts to con@@ tainment of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advan@@ tage@@ ous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation into February when the pres@@ idential aircraft was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ unternehmen , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the pres@@ idential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequent training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter sentences .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercises in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
helic@@ opter units additionally fle@@ w 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ pres@@ idential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved to exhibit the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not keep any bud@@ get@@ ing records for the pres@@ idential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement of the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; determining the costs for tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to an R@@ AND study from 2015 , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at that time the former White House press spokes@@ man , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things produced in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is reasonable to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helic@@ opter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga begins at the Tab@@ ellen@@ 3rd Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss tomorrow starts at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite five games still fla@@ w@@ less , the top leader of the Second Tennis League Bundes@@ liga has gained a sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation .
especially on the rear positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV above all the imports from the high north are concerned .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this will be as always difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er crew for the trip to the high north stands practical .
Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier could give his debut for blue @-@ white .
&quot; if the French Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is not currently active in the Italian Bi@@ ella team , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) plays in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first action in this season . &quot;
the un@@ conquered Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ ano @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the white rus@@ her An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; but he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two vic@@ tories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ pac@@ z could again move into the team again . &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his har@@ ass@@ ment to allow the law to be issued , the Congress packed into a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moscow &apos;s reaction was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels exports against the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russi@@ ans to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors in local O@@ MV , together with other European companies , are also worried about the construction of the Russian Eastern Soul Area North Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump itself would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions with Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available for him .
&quot; the press &quot; viewed itself , which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is spot@@ ted in the heading of Net@@ fli@@ x
08.11.2015 &#124; Desperate Housewives
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has put their attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traff@@ i@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pepe Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ ution authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back@@ wards : the town introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the municipal day@@ care centers , the watch is turning back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ regulation . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very happy . &quot;
cooked will continue to be cooked except house : a cat@@ erer will take on this task and supplies a fresh@@ ly cooked meal .
&quot; in the Kre@@ felder area , the city operates 46 children &apos;s day@@ care centers , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 2800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are looked after 45 weekly , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time workers from the 1st of September have kitchen service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with sal@@ ads , raw food and fruit , consuming the meal individually , give the food off , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides on the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
it is also about eating healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will in future be done by a special cleaning staff .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , also has the charm that it turned out to be the most economical solution for the city as the most economical solution for the city . &quot;
and that even though 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the educational field , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be genu@@ in@@ ely representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and become involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provin@@ cial council and the pres@@ idential elections take place on April 5th .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a selection process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peaceful from a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; said Hay@@ som , a strong role for women will rein@@ force Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent elec@@ toral commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3.6 million vot@@ ers registered .

men try to era@@ dic@@ ate 13 year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are to have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl .
&quot; according to the police information , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who sat up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 14.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
&quot; then one of the perpet@@ r@@ ators tried to grasp the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which however was ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; without lo@@ ot , the duo escaped . &quot;
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow at Man@@ age of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work at work , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea Kek@@ se produces . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch leader , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; &quot; voice concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentr@@ ates heavily on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and well @-@ being , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate , constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the side of La Liga may be of interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has he@@ eded the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried its best to take care of it since its arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG . &quot;
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in themselves , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association expressed interest in the PSG medium player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price quot@@ ations for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter dropped and damaged
&quot; in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown cul@@ pri@@ t has deliberately posed a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder street in front of the estate number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle material damage caused by more than 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for advice . &quot;
the police are looking for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and touch@@ ed the guiding plan . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese on Thursday evening .
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car came to meet him on his road , so that he had to go to the right . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Tour@@ an @-@ driver touched the console . &quot;
in the car there was no harm .
&quot; the driver of the next passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it may be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now request witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the perpet@@ r@@ ator , to contact the commission@@ er at Stol@@ zen@@ au at Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;

the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ s@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he was expecting an ap@@ ology from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ted Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own la@@ yo@@ ffs or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes at that time . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , cri@@ tici@@ zed that when reporting on violence against the Cathedral Spar@@ rows , it was measured with &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ments in Regensburg no one doubts that &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; &quot; act that would have to be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ bor@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the hab@@ it of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ mon@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you would like to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ out fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; wounds a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they find it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely un@@ just , author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted ?
&quot; in a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 cathedral @-@ cats were sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be sever@@ ely exp@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims of R. assessed the common humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , have even positive memories of him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger rati@@ fied his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence exer@@ cised by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more handy when a domain atz has no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : if you take the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all . &quot;
there are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspic@@ ion of mid@@ - or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside its sphere of activity .
&quot; at best , one can at best repro@@ ach it , from it too late , or having taken first references seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ m@@ Gramm@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es as - literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y and &quot; always enc@@ amped by children &apos;s grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority is compla@@ ining about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which has already led to out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and cast the keys on the floor , but also distributed ear co@@ war@@ dly and too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he had already admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ olog@@ ised for it . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , with both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced it in a sec@@ ular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually works in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the abuse of violence at the pre @-@ school , this is free of Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; the question is , whether it is not with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just cr@@ um@@ bled upon him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many people who never understood him are still working eag@@ erly . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report a lot was reported on the topic of abuse in the government of Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put on any involvement or co @-@ involvement with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael E@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugur@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; said a retired representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame are silent .
&quot; if they did not even famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ators . &quot;
how do the scra@@ per students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael E@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is ac@@ custom@@ ed to him ... Bu@@ ben un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive or more clear or more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , confi@@ d@@ ants , etc . &quot;
that you talk with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any con@@ scienti@@ ousness . &quot;
he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate its good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; was read at Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was presented in the report &quot; Wa@@ iting . &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and bl@@ ur@@ red into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but this is , in turn , an abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , there is clean separation between the primary school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the cathedral sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , we say once , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; all the horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were arbit@@ rar@@ ily stra@@ ined and irre@@ plac@@ eable , all of them took place at the Preschool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prev@@ ailed . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he did not get the boys to face when they were already on the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this one , as the most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; Preschool &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ cal &quot; conditions .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ m@@ Gramm@@ um ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even positive memories of him . &quot;
&quot; in this way , at most the repro@@ ach remains to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods where he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then back in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger set the ears consistently before the states ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , he continues to practice the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test sentence also had long been b@@ anned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , as each one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to assess , where the affected may perhaps ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot;
this is just not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the death penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards for that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck des An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evalu@@ ating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess is already quite right .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what was in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
it &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipline and punishment , i.e. to draw ear co@@ war@@ dly and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then b@@ anned , he strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you again , for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; however , the issue of testing was also the case for language ? &quot;
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , because the cathedral @-@ cats played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all van@@ ish that he led there a strict reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the challenge of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ s , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y alone one makes no great singers and above every success , no matter what field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience George R@@ atz@@ inger during conversations with her book ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep faith and heart@@ y people from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something too much . &quot;
&quot; I receive regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him until today , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ful man , to which she still looked up and whom she almost ven@@ er@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; and please , again quite clearly : all you repro@@ ach him are educational methods , which were then on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long over@@ taken this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the propri@@ ety was able to find a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
