<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is dug."</seg>
<seg id="4">Kleingärtner cultivate the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everyone who had to get exciting because the car-Navi took place on a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that one does not recognize equally.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, called urpositional leaves, were worked for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the data from the Bayerische Publisher, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even though the French troops ended up with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Prince Elector Max IV. Joseph propelled the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian survey management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Munich Urpositional Journal of Munich originates from the year 1856 and is to be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is a restart which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as the Munich-based district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the west-park is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the beginning zooming a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwriting numbered flags from the so-called" "urn" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots today no longer prove farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 location of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name" at Gasteig "or from the" "On the Ventilation" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and for example ended the Ankle of so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the prison. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, later it was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotor centre in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric hospitals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east residences from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in architectural style according to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was marked as" "main square" "in 1856, the Kaufinger lane was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where this day prepares the preparations and on 5 April 2017 of the ground breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn strain route."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017 calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state and to prevent extreme caution."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the criminal prosecution authorities of the state which disproportionately aimed at minorities, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that people pass through.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the trip and was taken custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report from Missouri's office of the Missouri Office, which shows that black motorists in the state are more prevalent than whites in the state."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready whether to bring Caution money or let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in the year 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI 'hate crime report, which ranks the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The subproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Hof project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliament members Peter White and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the grave yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU town association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accomodates in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "is for him the alternative marketable way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV President of Fischerbach, he described the subproject as an" elementary importance. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green grooves care for a lot of work, much has to be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed this without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune recognized the significance of the electric project and is happy about the leaders of the leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the forestation of the surfaces could be drawn up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operation," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure space thus amounts to 40 hectares which may not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by half of the leaders, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of soft-grain."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job without farmers and maidens.</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiss also stated:" "the best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-of-the-art (LPR) Baden-Württemberg provides the state-of-the-art promotion of soft-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the holding of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyance recorded by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be tractable (slope inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the challenge."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fisher bacher Project 2018 currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firgen square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President for drastic limitation of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took their meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta said," "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is literally right, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your rubbles, your arms, / your displaced masses who desire to breathe freely, / the eleventh waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh apostasy" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who committed themselves to place their words on the basis of their death, knew very well that they did a high political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus, the importance of the statue changed, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writing hitch Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"at this point, Limbaugh is quite unusual here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often awful journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not shine the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship cadres" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">Record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland there is something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the crew to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her chapter speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silvermedaillengewinner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m barrier, says it is" unbelievable "that 16 ballots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Schottlands so far best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-distance runner Muir leads this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1500 m, is another Scotsman that one should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" very proud "of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team mates chose me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as an established athlete, athletes who want to climb on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a captain is concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to put on this home support and profit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion again.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics About Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers killed him because of everything, from domestic politics to political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he choosed in the criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critic into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said," "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep for slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hockey's staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the Governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?." "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary warhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hair-less head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blockage of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or braces or hasserted people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hockey's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not brasserted, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the governor was designated as" "concentrated spam-attack", "would probably call others" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or a negative comment is deleted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest or to silence protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happened digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise that he complains Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County was the last Amendment, according to US District judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter on their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefers hit his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"the petitions that criticised the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have it to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="369">The lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread injuries "in Papua including the Paniai Shooting."</seg>

<seg id="472">"in addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document was also a glorious farm belonging to the church or patron and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>

<seg id="523">The new re wants to invest around 20 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football have an impact on Neymars's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not bother Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will be coming to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organisation that supervises the European game has the power to bid teams from access to the prestigious champion League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEFA 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point, that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to get the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can make money loose with certainty, to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the rich ruling family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must be able to counteract the break-even point in their football-related business with legitimate income sources."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini according to his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that associations, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP moved from concentration on the debts of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in the United Kingdom in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, leaving the sum of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overboard their financial supervision by connecting their income through companies associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a cataract could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG-payments to Neymar could come into Qatar on payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"however, PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar World Cup will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easily identified."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the former penalties against PSG indicate that the UEFA will be even more attentive, every attempt to take into account the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"the UEFA had no pre-preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, announcing the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG-situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey acquisitions."</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when they retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying print."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the policymakers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members to raise an increase in this month as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflationary report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that inflation would continue to rise to just under 3% in the autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalized that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation of preheated inflation, and she said that credit costs could rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut business package, which was issued a year ago after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that now they will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" "in the central forecasting of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates, it reiterated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat bigger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the bank emphasised that increases would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's predicted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell to this news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations for an interest rate, and GDP has risen to 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low salary increases, as the sharpening gets worse at first before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot" "prevent the income gap in the next few years," "but she added that wages were" "clearly" "to recover at the end of its three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which is compensated for a portion of lower consumer spending."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in the last August after the shocking EU vote, causing the sinking of the pounds."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the last ruling of the Bank on interest rates, the call for interest rates had increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-displaced households, whereby three policy makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will be attracting it in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the exceedance in proportion to their goal of 2% was to be attributed to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montess, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline in Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive, as the lenders are still looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner. "</seg>

<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice last year, confirming that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the assertion that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>

<seg id="1296">Prepositional phylosis (prep) is a result of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep reduced the HIV transmission at risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a veterinarian can also register for a possible participation in their local sexuality clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The programme will be CHF 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to evaluate the overall potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence, how it is used on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in which more than three decades lasting progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep when targeting targeted and endangered people offers the possibility to alter the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"we sincerely welcome this announcement." ""</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is quickly done throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow-health minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of late delay and reluctant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transfer of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, turned into a Earls Court apartment in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms together, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is mutual, so that when you push the door very easily slide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they succeeded in enlarging the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and raised squaremetrics of something standardly in something amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this."</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion of the separation occurs in the Supreme Court of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco Jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 single trade stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"according to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the" Principal Operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the corporate assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him behind what I was holding for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hope to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated dairy bars and delicatessens from the late 1950-s and bought a business in Brunswick during the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says he began Westco when he was" "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 were hoping to add their property to their sons.</seg>

<seg id="1380">Colin has held back very well although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"only Colin replied by SMS to say" "I really can't say much," "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our surname through the dishes," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have willed that Paul and I would end up in our current conflict," "he said, added that he still hope for a solution."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss at a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first working day with leading employees, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: poor information getting into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings, because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television reaches decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were to convince," "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keep trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steadfast praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter's habit has ever been under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trumps tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his colleagues managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently hindered it that trump checking out controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he can find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone accused the president malignant a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," "being the source behind a bunch of leaks" "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter for chicane, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accusations in the past and has revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmaker added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="1419">"since the address is unknown, the help of the population is worshipped and hoped."</seg>
<seg id="1420">The police all over Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer (virtual) postcards.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">"the house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1, next year."</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the former Ambiente OperGesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, some 30 000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenue was also due to the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in the face of dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which provided controversy discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not disputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"however, above all Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auctions in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you will be Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a longer period of time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is done."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings are partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "very bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery draus."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to set itself wide, Scherer explains."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"single vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel at home in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">Discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause have already led so shavers.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city were identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the level of investments, Thomas Scherer will not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outdoor installations are also placed on the front, which is clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard there is a large terrace, which is open to the restaurant, which is open to the public."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Monkey: us-Special Inspector presupposes Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special issuer Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the committee recorded the work in the past weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "with reference to people who were familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper advertised the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported that there was already the first invitations of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trumpältestem son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men should stand who acted as adviser to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also received more and more trumps of private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the special issuer Trump had personally moved into the centre and examines the reproach whether the President possibly hinders the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">Grand Jurys's main task is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to invite persons to the hearing under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN transmitter, demonstrations have already been issued, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former Electoral Committee Paul Manafort attended the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening, legal experts told us that the enforcement show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in order to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the implementation of the Gremiums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening in order to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russian history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme gives the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement, he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this also usually work in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorse any action that accelerated the work of the special mediator in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to accept that something has changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">"however, Mueller had only been used after fired Comey."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rationale, allegations were made against Trump, he wanted to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump had asked him to set up investigations against the former national security advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">Unsolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the congress, such as the Watergate affair with the later recited President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the presidency of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented lawmakers on Thursday, after which the special issuer could no longer be dismissed so easily."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"the colossus exaggerated over a Billion metric tons and 5800 square kilometres to the north and will probably need two, three years until it was melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for man does not go out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to research data, it is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there have been a series of unusual coquarries in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile basis."</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfile.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"it is swimmers in the sea, and is fed by great glaciers."</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed some years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfile is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece is cut off at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Scheleis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after melting."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the arc causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in small dimensions, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C-Schelfile is the fourth largest shelf-file of Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the passage from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists we argued whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or go back and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if this researcher does not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a lot of ice-animals in the Antarctic peninsula have collapsed over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>

<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on the working day and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented of the application deficit."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, to show concrete measures for transformer climbers and involve a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that they did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is from a" "right" "competition of the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service from illness or age."</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it's time to act so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Erdogan, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long ago in the circle of work for a fist surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses, and the rest of the parties were astounding."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the municipal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the county government should strive with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a house-arif," so peoples. "</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in doing so, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually sees the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, enhancements or more money, if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German Relief Organisation" "youth Rettet" "because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has been in operation only for one year, refused to express itself to the detailed proposals of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that at the moment we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone," "said the organisation in an opinion on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only evaluate all the accusations currently being collected, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had watched the boat from 'youth Rettet', the Iuventa, supervised since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that his crew takes inflatable migrants on board, which are delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can go down so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was claimed only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of imposing itself over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats as the Iuventa, above all, have to have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to remember the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign themselves, Nobel Prize laureates-organization doctors are without limits (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had decreased dramatically in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with the local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the Minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1613">"in future, the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than fighting in wind and weather over the stadium racing?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this also recognized the first federal state associations, which are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>

<seg id="1623">"the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year-olds, that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be much more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundesligamannschaft to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What's the right thing about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"e-Sport will focus on computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or the football simulation of FIFA on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in the normal sport, they have long been established, in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games 2022 e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many people the idea is surely getting used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that you also find in the classic sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the Fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"robbery also sees problems:" doping becomes more and more a topic. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by the consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association Interaktive Entertainsoftware (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, that is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte advisers. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was condemned in June for a negligent murder of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and facing down, when she was sentenced."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no repentance." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance which they regret absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy who said that there is" "no day, in which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I go with everything. I try, in spite of all my pain, which we will bear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the realization that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person to have with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the event attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text announcements that they encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, spring from a building, pierce yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is to switch on the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the fall by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unceasing drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, Neutrals, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings reach."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are skinned, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto started his office in December 2012. 589 stands up for attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer by Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a sonder advocate was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely brought to justice by journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated as" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey Mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility 'when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broken with the blame, that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, who presumed gangmembers also bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave Valdez for the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues in the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the toxicity problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper served a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard work without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it took."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do in the face of so many dead men... why did you not tell us what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curse as a dockman, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love for the routine of his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrongly, keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smells a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative muggling roughts, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no mobile phones were allowed. days earlier, it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside looking for two policemen protected from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers who were not trustworthy of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce left three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the public spending which concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the public prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local from drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incident in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Khapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months before, readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body statur. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the Valdez office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the Western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become more louder than they have written in organized protests" SOS Press "on sidewalks and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez indicted the authorities to spy journalists and to leave them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is once again shared by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, participating government officials and a" "indifferent society". ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media guard group" Articulo 19 "was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note signed by Zetas-Kartell," Here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue on how El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading" What do you want about us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking is frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office and drinking beer when all their phones began to summarise."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting fights with ribbles and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the curb edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phones.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the Riodoce staff followed his footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"as you can only remember," "said Bojorquez," "said Bojorquez," "when the same day when Javier was murdered, the trainees asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used cloak to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have discovered that the first findings of the unbelievable rhino horn of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even notice that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a" "restless past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the preserved armoured dinosaurs, ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved condition has startled researchers, who describe it as" "really remarkable" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earthling."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you smile only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivores, even though it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-condensation, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed us to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs has made headlines for the first time and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armaments on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta surpasses by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur of enough pressure was hunted by meat eaters dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals, who use the shading - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which indicates that this noise-aurier was subjected to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaurs shows how dangerous the dinosaur carnions must have been the chalk-time," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal referring to information about his life, including his preserved intestine, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to be much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the preserved armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips hung by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater refunds kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The clogged remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin crust still cover up-prige tank-plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates carrying the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are moved upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous wounded, kilometre long stout - and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the Autobahn Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass Carambolage on the late Thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"after the first data of the police were at 5 p.m. between the junction boxes Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm about 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, interconnected."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there is no information about the exact number of the injured."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it is light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the direction of travel in Munich, a ten-kilometre long retreat was formed."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as a AZ-reporter reports, it was also on the counter-road to massive disabilities - by numerous gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire department noted the signs of the vehicle workers, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 o'clock another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: company testet "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes one of us or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Credit Card control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer comes, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is expected to be available on many other long distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the train ticket utilisation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book your ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "comfort check-in" "works like this: one gets into the train, calling his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"with the testers, then a button for electronic devaluation appears."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"the train companions get a message on their mobile devices, that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y taken."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when the train attendant arrives at seat Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue to keep silence."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" "check-in" "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">Those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train escort staff simply check out in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, DB Remote Head of Marketing Management. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"those who often travel by train, know that apart from delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest offences."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times one has, in any case, one of the fellow travelers, not all the documents necessary for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to assign.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes the Schaffner at the end time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of testers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Other train numbers on the same track are not yet released.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police killed just a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly riveted on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns alive body that was stretched out on the street and stayed there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She turned her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying out, and by a man who claimed to be Browns's father who said a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman told his rifle and cried," "I will kill you all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," he remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt the chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience resulting from the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a rell with her daughter, who carried a cauliflower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation that she had many times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a latant racism, it is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local partner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped them pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came into mind:" do you want to document, or try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism rum around Todestrakt-occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his involvement brought Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the team led by" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we talk," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that" "movement" "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," "Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life as she fell in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's story repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, following the killing of black teenagers Trayby Martin in 2012, have shaped the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is no affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who poured out this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the communication cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"she is still clinging to a chant and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The Bit Gallery moves the people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg". ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery say," "This would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "This would be real great" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need people "(Siggi Boccupy) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the supporters are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, of which also the other shops benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct markers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of the construction work it will end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-Platz, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping for many years almost a week in the farmers market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women are always happy again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that even during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But the new project will probably not be very low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping bag in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores stand empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, retail stores are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the local rents are often not tradable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall go there during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost Bit Gallery already manage to sell all stores from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmers market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst imposed a 35-year prison sentence after being publicly classified as secret diplomatic reports of WikiLeaks's website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called a Becoming resemblance (A fitting similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has created the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which has been extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born when he was born in Bradley Edward but has been openly acquitted since her puberty on identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 due to 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wigs - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project" Stranger Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts like cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce an image of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated Muse have become unequal bribes, which interchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppressed Images" "by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would convert chelseas judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings dismissal after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong in the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweetable ways to further flaming the rigid divisions he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the weird timing of all these things, she said that things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with her superior signature (the" i "in her family name) is an end to" automatic fragmentation, the basis of sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spacious Memories is also to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is one page of the above-mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as it emerges with a hands-free phone in hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech cold, then they won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"scanning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, from their own genomic simulacres, which gather together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haploggroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was hiding behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene of the event, and Detective investigates the stitches as murder, while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">She has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that laythem had now been judged and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus."</seg>

<seg id="2169">"a speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "we are in touch with the UK police in contact and willing to help the US investigative authorities every possible way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them, reinforce themselves," Guglielmi said. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said, the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that were laymen and warehouses in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the official funded doping in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation, as our anti-doping system has given up an error. "</seg>

<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015."</seg>

<seg id="2207">"there was simply no consistency and objectivity," "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed."</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, to address special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistle-blowers permit to handle the C-Suite executives and address directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?"

<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three trainings of UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the Moras six playing times in Westwood practiced practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. "</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>

<seg id="2302">"for someone who is so smitten with old papers, that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England (" To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting ") seems to be all too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hymen on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank whiskey and started to write.</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last one, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to worry about the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years, in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps that represent what possessed," "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," "says Rhodes," but there was a birch fighting for the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all of it!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base into the English story, among them 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uprising that appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant insurrection began in this area and I thought, an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patcher, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years throughout the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell produced from the 18th century, which staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying about rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise lightly."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique write-experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämämäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wire-puller of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who should have been involved directly in the attempted coup attempt, will be negotiated this week in Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup Erdogan had called the fall attempt as" "God's gift", "as he gave him the opportunity to fully purify the armed forces."</seg>

<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article with the heading" Discomfort in the military headquarters. ""</seg>

<seg id="2354">The great interference in the army and the security forces is at any rate further.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"Erdogan ordered another 7395 Nationals by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the worldly state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his election victory in 2002 Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan exaggerates a targeted Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "an especially not-known officer, who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt, the Turkish army will be" "full extremists and Salafists" "in a few years."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't become more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adapt" "his robot in accordance with his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford woman progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpufers have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine features, the playing on rape, when one goes a step to frigid (i.e. here: conflicting) Farrah goes, troubled one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy compatible with a vibrator on his website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it's called on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and growing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission to an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has curtailed to have sexual assaults."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the swollen body and the stewed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical likelihood to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with porn star proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel inhumane that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything, which could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is noticeable in another context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the cruel possibility that one day its babies will no longer be repulsed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are" normalized, "which suddenly appear to be an epitome of reasonableness at once compared to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urinary version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both in fact seem to be a very mild crime."</seg>

<seg id="2563">"according to the city of Haslach, who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should have a completed academic studies as a master engineer or a bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study confirms exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes cramping and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the sufferers are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to dissolve inflammations are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance stimulates immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet of tolerant diet tolerates a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel type, if the same system also helps people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral candidate Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study-mice had such cells but another group of the same tribe, which had not had this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice were sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbial and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolites known as an Indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans like mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, taxpayers will cost up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter was manufactured in Connecticut, next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House requested the presence of helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to its superiors, the deputy marine mandeur for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second squad needed for the return flight due to the restriction of the working hours."</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original airplane was during the event at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records made available, it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal public ownership for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the atch Act, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commandant. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you are locked," "answered the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impulse to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate and promoted the efforts to containment of government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February Trump carried out an investigation into February when the presidential aircraft was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, Taxiunternehmen, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crew frequent training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to suspend the US president in the White House with precise centimeter sentences.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as Trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercises in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted for the training needs of the crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers overtook the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not keep any budgeting records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement of the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"determining the costs for taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to an RAND study from 2015, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things produced in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"and I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is reasonable to emphasize that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour across the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire fighter."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump said to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own layoffs or their then false estimation of the processes at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that when reporting on violence against the Cathedral Sparrows, it was measured with" two measures. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the encroachments in Regensburg no one doubts that" "shameful and shameful deeds" "act that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" "degree of media manipulation", "says the author Lucetta Scarboria, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scarmonia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you would like to go to the church and that's a devout frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "wounds a very normal pedagogical means" "had been" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they find it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely unjust, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg to the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"in a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen, between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 cathedral-cats were sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be severely expelled."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims of R. assessed the common humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, have even positive memories of him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger ratified his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence exercised by the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise their" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who became more handy when a domain atz has no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Eemann: if you take the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of mid- or co-knowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school were also expropriated outside its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can at best reproach it, from it too late, or having taken first references seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the DomspatzymGrammum, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all interviewees as - literally" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger as" warm, "" popular, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" competent, "and" understanding, "as a very good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always encamped by children's grapes. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only knead with chairs and cast the keys on the floor, but also distributed ear cowardly and too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he had already admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, with both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced it in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually works in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the abuse of violence at the pre-school, this is free of Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"the question is, whether it is not with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just crumbled upon him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many people who never understood him are still working eagerly."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report a lot was reported on the topic of abuse in the government of Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also put on any involvement or co-involvement with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Eemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said a retired representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even familiarize themselves with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral director, who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scraper students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Eemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it is accustomed to him... Buben unobtrusive or more clear or more open than to their parents, dormitory managers, confidants, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any conscientiousness."</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate its good name with these conflicting crimes, as it unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "nonviolence" "was read at Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was presented in the report "Waiting."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Eemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and blurred into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but this is, in turn, an abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is clean separation between the primary school and the gymnasium of the cathedral spatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, we say once, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were arbitrarily strained and irreplaceable, all of them took place at the Preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he did not get the boys to face when they were already on the cathedral gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this one, as the most witnesses emphasise, the subject" Preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisical" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the DomspatzymGrammum?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Eemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even positive memories of him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"in this way, at most the reproach remains to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods where he was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger set the ears consistently before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Eemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that," that in the pre-school, he continues to practice the death penalty. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in the face of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test sentence also had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, as each one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to assess, where the affected may perhaps exaggerate or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the death penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Eemann: we historians speak of" Fallstrick des Anachronism, "that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not for what was in the pre-school of resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all terrible and I'm glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ear cowardly and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you again, for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">"however, the issue of testing was also the case for language?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Eemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, because the cathedral-cats played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all vanish that he led there a strict regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the challenge of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trans, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone one makes no great singers and above every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience George Ratzinger during conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Eemann: through working on the book and beyond, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep faith and hearty people from whom you can't imagine that he could do something too much."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I receive regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovely respectful man, to which she still looked up and whom she almost venerate."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again quite clearly: all you reproach him are educational methods, which were then on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overtaken this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the propriety was able to find a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
