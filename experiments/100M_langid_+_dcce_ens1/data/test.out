Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ mistak@@ ably clear .
I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or stuck from outside Label stuck with me and the reality mostly little to do .
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ ff to me . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
&quot; as a favorite , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , front TV with delicious Dut@@ t and mex@@ ican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us starting on 25 August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses arrived at their holidays , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lop home to the fo@@ d@@ der . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he let himself be led by his family about the anne@@ x of AL@@ RV , on a horse he s@@ wore not even for photographic purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with the CHI@@ O . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help handed over the man from Schaff@@ hausen as part of a small g@@ ala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
even the British Queen has already bl@@ amed him .
long is the 18th winner of the Sport Pyram@@ id .
in Aachen he met the first award winner Hans Günter Wink@@ ler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro the same .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Gym@@ ner Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sporting le@@ gends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP &apos;s Trade Agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two U.S. pres@@ idential candidates are un@@ certain in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , philosop@@ hical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will drive regulations massi@@ vely , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Tr@@ ump and Clinton have to be invested almost immediately . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly refused by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump there could be some party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ launch coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ is@@ ian climate protection agreement intends to termin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ aci@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade - but just protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should be paid better then , for example , Clinton demands . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a minimum of hunger .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must get up , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics regard him , so that the budget defic@@ it would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who at least want to ask the rich to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in his arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tab@@ let@@ op .
until she not@@ ices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and is concerned with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for single @-@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has made up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s A@@ id . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as hope for Europe , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in women others out@@ wei@@ gh other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al away from it , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , honor@@ ary mur@@ der@@ ers , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , mis@@ ses , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inf@@ erior and worst mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are ac@@ custom@@ ed to say nothing .
or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big .
&quot; since they often do not know to help , there are more accommodations only for them , requires B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in the housing of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , refugees are not being accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ ks , there are stor@@ eys or own houses in some common shel@@ ters and their own homes only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of women and gender equality &quot; also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together , there may be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this protective need can be read at the rush , which there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily create a second home .
System@@ administrator ( m / w )
representatives of the assistant physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that the ministers would have agreed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed upon the rejection of a contract agreed with B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the Treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to reject the proposed new contract fully and requested official re @-@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today filed a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour campaign measures launched at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assistant physicians in this year were sixth , the first complete fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA Assistant Doctor , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , resign@@ ed after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were still taking place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , confir@@ ming that the contract should be advan@@ tage@@ ous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to procla@@ im an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot for@@ bid myself that Ankara would most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ rower and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an spoke repeatedly by his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved as if not anything bad happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s bright , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was ra@@ v@@ aged .
Putin dism@@ is@@ sed and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia .
going on was even bigger since it was committed by a friend of mine .
&quot; re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks were to bear the blame for everything .
&quot; at the earn@@ est , the alle@@ g@@ ations of senior officials reported that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use that he wanted to hear from President Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
Russia could win a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clearly obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an mainly needs all the friends he can get after he was released last month at a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat almost his ministry .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti described it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry with the West , because its response to the attempted power tak@@ eover was regarded as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ red to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian state of State gained a bonus that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected officials . &quot;
&quot; this is well marked for Moscow , a matter of course , which has a deep fear of reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries , who turn away from the West and feel badly treated and now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks , both idents met at the press conference saying that they had not even stri@@ ped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally missed a question of their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey has fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Board of Management of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand shall only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this period , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financing brands . &quot;
&quot; they supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the IP@@ O will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for retail , which will be more meaningful - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investment stamp and the brand , among which our employees are busy , as we now become more a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these stamps will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be possible to sponsor the Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , for how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achiev@@ es its 3,@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double in New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jockey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured British profit at New@@ market on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he made a milestone on Pre@@ f@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jockey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said , &quot; It &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .

&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle @-@ race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 493 Career &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jockey of Modernis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have achieved before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for race , his enthusiasm and char@@ ism enthusi@@ as@@ tically loved fans for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6@@ .000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and great tournament ho@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden in the UK for almost 30 years what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbeliev@@ able Jockey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone in a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wra@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of large @-@ scale tournament win , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ ori@@ ous Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his two @-@ fl@@ utes and to return to his top form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russia Putin F@@ ed Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ is@@ sed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years from Putin &apos;s closest legitimate revol@@ t .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who was dep@@ uty since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Tokyo emb@@ assy . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it means ( in Russian ) that he later became the director and staff leader of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin on his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state concerning laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ a@@ ino recommended as his successor .
do the sm@@ iling faces convince ?
this step took Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants and works as he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff has resign@@ ed at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great sc@@ ep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - embarrass@@ ed post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin has been a member of the K@@ GB National Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov , one of five people , whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; it was once assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin could viol@@ ate Putin &apos;s constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , affiliated company Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he beat producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical confron@@ tation at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced its resign@@ ation in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; on the set , there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion . &quot;
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with it since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love criminal mine and put my whole heart blood into the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will not be possible now . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled char@@ isma of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
mystery around the fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin Ba@@ in thinks that the 75 fish might act around Sand@@ als , which were picked up by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of spect@@ acle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; Deck@@ geb@@ lä@@ se &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lashes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of engineering from a truly epic scale to this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of all the bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high @-@ end and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or shore side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern brid@@ ge@@ bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weigh@@ s about 6@@ .000 tons and had to be pulled up at an inc@@ line of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; kel , as the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have luck to be alive
three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of An@@ gl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re r@@ n@@ li ambul@@ ance station struck at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and asked us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blow@@ n the boat out of its reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hung on a bu@@ oy without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came abo@@ ard the rescue boat and returned to the rescue station
Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive .
&quot; although the boat was equipped with a stop@@ per , this sol@@ dered the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has watches over these men today .
seriously injured - man insi@@ sts on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the key to the apartment in order to pick up his personal things . &quot;
instead the alcoholic ber@@ cul@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
she then aler@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companion .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life companion .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old drew his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who is building Braunschweig affordable housing ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mine : investors shall in future be required more strongly in the future .
how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; at the next meeting , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; Living plan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing .
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the great point of dispute in the town hall is , however , said Brat@@ man : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions and still need to be financed , should provide inc@@ enti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; despite this , so Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; yet the program does not yet exist altogether , because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do we compare the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion is going to run over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning oli@@ tic spokes@@ man Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
one stroke could solve the problem .
&quot; for in the west city , the year @-@ end dates are made . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing construction companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West city is again dras@@ tically increased , one remo@@ ves from the goal of so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion .

this concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon go , a hunt for health and happiness &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teen@@ agers and children no longer go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors on screens , compla@@ ined of many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and get more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclu@@ de each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena in pop culture , interest in the release of the game sank in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ bur@@ dened .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go was more user than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation playing the game when she was younger , joined the tram and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game resulted in a significant increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot;
&quot; car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ ump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for increased performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; hit de@@ af ears , because many public messages are bor@@ ed and coming from people who look el@@ ingly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports reduces their chances of getting cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the Wonder@@ ful of Pok@@ é@@ mon go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also mur@@ der@@ ers who have to compla@@ in about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has happened a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will continue with the time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and helping many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier . &quot;

brilliant . brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast ki@@ cked on Thursday for multiple combat titles and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; its total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ al Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ns on the Swedish beam during the single @-@ stage campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ e is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi@@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same le@@ ague , such as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world champ@@ ionships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it awa@@ ited them a final test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ e and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ battle array of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ e repeated the first med@@ al on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clam@@ ation mark at the f@@ are@@ well party of retired team coordin@@ ator Martha Car@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ o insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during its long way , it is not really true . &quot;
&quot; part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical lap@@ ing pass - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio . &quot;
this is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , trained in the gym@@ nasi@@ um , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost a competition @-@ contest , a winning series that will last for a long time as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two turns , the picture sli@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; she repeated with 15,@@ 433 again on the Swedish beam - and placed one on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ raced her gently as she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ man was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when they fought for the third place , but the bronze med@@ al went in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old men &apos;s capit@@ als , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their floor exercise , she thre@@ w kis@@ ses to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which appeared sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as it is concerned , the rapidly spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial kil@@ ler when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to the police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous attack of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Lena Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots out of a hand @-@ held fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder should not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , because the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to get closer look , whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; altogether , seven people were killed and two more injured in nine months in nine attacks . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; reported Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting that went on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial kil@@ ler .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto love singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his age enjoyed Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder known by his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let go of it .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has set itself on it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund can never know it under certain circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit nor scra@@ pe up until his third year of age and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the language that Ed@@ mund wrote for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him symbolic language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund invented several characters alone .
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a long time after the pro@@ g@@ nosis because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
&quot; however , Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it gets better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ area floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call on the emergency room on Friday . it is expected to start the whole Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with large floo@@ ds after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the congreg@@ ations concerned .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while mobile continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record level throughout the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ tmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as they will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level that was ever recorded on Friday at 9 : 00 am . &quot;
rescue teams still hat@@ ch people from flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son &apos;s son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son &apos;s son , who lives near , warned him . &quot;
&quot; we are wo@@ ken up and the water flows and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years , where she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the han@@ di@@ caps , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Krau@@ tmann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly &quot; , &quot; as there continued to be heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls , and that the authorities would consider ev@@ ac@@ uation assign@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; according to Krau@@ tmann , an observer was reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Krau@@ tmann said that the ground was considerably weigh@@ ed down by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and Tut@@ si in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had 200 floo@@ ded houses .
&quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both floo@@ ded . &quot;

&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were set up in order to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water begins to return , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and provided sand bags for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their homes and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys stated that it continued on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday no registr@@ ations were reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , lives in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; Sav@@ es of B@@ alls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police agree that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the le@@ aning , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a great deal , his small body was en@@ chan@@ ted by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ is@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that he is likely to recover .
he would have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29 year old , who found himself in a critical state , reported the sender . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men of the perpet@@ r@@ ators could be .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had come to a cross @-@ fire between several guns .
&quot; cartridge he@@ els for assault ri@@ f@@ les , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ f@@ les , se@@ w@@ ed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continual struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk , they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; here , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; divided police chiefs Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
several houses and vehicles have also been taken in the area .
&quot; there was no fixed record , and the police are currently checking reports that the surveillance video was reported . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squ@@ ee@@ zer , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone to Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gym@@ nasi@@ um and that is more than a reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , who is Catholic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic feminine presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female gym@@ na@@ sts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champ@@ ions Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi@@ party event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes across the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie proposed all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last five &quot; because the next Olympics ship will have only four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality shows that gym@@ nas@@ tics are a more expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts first and foremost in private train@@ ers , which can be maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their gym@@ nas@@ tics and families ) . the list can be continued as desired . &quot;
&quot; the majority of these Turn@@ stones are located in weal@@ thy suburbs , which can support business . &quot;
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started with the gym@@ nas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer the congreg@@ ations of au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ sti@@ ce at 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable apartments in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer young high @-@ quality gym@@ nas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you ass so many young girls with different background to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant physicians would like to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s suggestion
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amend@@ ments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistant physicians voted in a vote refused . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt &apos;s plans were un@@ vei@@ led to introduce the contract for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant physicians should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and week cal@@ endar@@ s to improve care for un@@ hospit@@ able times . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the President of the B@@ MA Com@@ mitt@@ ees for Assistant physicians , announced last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have made serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular , that it will inc@@ ur the current occup@@ ancy crisis and it will be ad@@ ministered to meet all doctors . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through conversations strug@@ g@@ led with the government for resistance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened in a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made the last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt has to act now , lift up the condition and address the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a sur@@ ge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 terminals , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to give doctors on the strike cap . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to be able to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA would like to have a better weekend remun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 Regist@@ rar , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance providers to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work campaigns achieve nothing of the little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assistance and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries having responded positively to concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a vocational training , training cur@@ es , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , health education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with agreements with B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons suffering from heart disease .
&quot; the medication is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended for four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ atory Authority has recommended for four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ cover@@ ings .
&quot; when the flooring dis@@ rup@@ ts , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ICE , which is published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Healthcare Research Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ stro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness to blo@@ om elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that widespread elec@@ toral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devast@@ ating government report today revealed .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally att@@ aches the police , ob@@ servers and coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of elec@@ toral abuse due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an anti @-@ cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside elec@@ toral cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should have an identification with themselves , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
the report pro@@ poses to add non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person if they give up their elec@@ toral vote in order to prevent somebody sel@@ ects twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against elec@@ toral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud that comes along with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Ele@@ ction Scale in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the reign@@ ing mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; , &quot; and that he would have killed his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; lead his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person cho@@ oses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters , who made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice in the older members of the Muslim community . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including guiding of ways to prove identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says , &quot; &quot; As proof it was raised that pressure was exer@@ cised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose from the will of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... government institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensi@@ tivities with regard to eth@@ no and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists edit mail@@ boxes to stop &quot; &quot; election harv@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask vot@@ ers prior to your choice .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they have released their voice to prevent somebody sel@@ ects twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic let@@ ter@@ press .
ban that political activists are able to complete full mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ings .
the police give the authority to set off barriers for election stations .
a change in law which facilitates an accus@@ ation for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Auth@@ orities Assembly 1983 ) .
photography b@@ anned in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , in order to ensure that employees rule out the rule that vot@@ ers are alone in the elec@@ toral cabin . &quot;
Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that according to Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the arbit@@ ral Tribunal denied Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; waste control &quot; of the election regi@@ stran@@ ts of the town hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; The Court of Judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; as the mother of parliam@@ ents , our country carries a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled distribution of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler double @-@ runner and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio won over the French wheel sports@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of the border and band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ decker of the Duke of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ kin is by far not the only one to have gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger . at least not , if one may give faith to social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces running on our screens , F@@ email created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy El@@ lis@@ on , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger written on the race track , many people on the Internet pointed out how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy El@@ lis@@ on has caused a rush on Twitter , after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I think that is a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes should be able to go through as a double viol@@ inist for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one ais@@ le higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor .
&quot; another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe eyeb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian Silver med@@ alli@@ sts Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans att@@ ested , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities too
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter user stated that &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ al winner in the gym@@ nas@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , showing her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like a pig died &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr 4x@@ 200m Frei@@ ght@@ sch@@ wimm@@ ingly emp@@ tied spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ al Games on Wednesday
&quot; Canadian Sender C@@ BC once had to exc@@ use after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; fell down &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot;
comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he had his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Frei@@ stil@@ sch@@ wimm@@ sta@@ ffel .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was taken on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; color , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; to be too excited , he went like a pig , died as a pig . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Hai@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the s@@ wimming@@ pool 1 : 57,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds s@@ lower than Canada Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to open up the gap to China . &quot;
spectators across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ Far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Hai@@ han from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m Frei@@ sing pool for women : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was swi@@ ft and hard , with which many presented him . &quot;
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like raci@@ sts . # sh@@ ank@@ ed .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast over a swimming capacity . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , it is sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the commentary volume Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC collabor@@ ated and added his exc@@ use to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compla@@ ined about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we regret it sin@@ cere that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our follow @-@ up in social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ fortunate wording . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said is very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald exc@@ used in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal assault . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , he said . &quot;
&quot; I applied myself to the performance of the Schwi@@ mmer , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who is in the middle of the shop sham@@ eless under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman went out of her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try them . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered her as she looked at it , pulled her back and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tried four pairs of pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear her under@@ wear , she ref@@ unded and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of pants from the position , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried it . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three further h@@ osen , before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t remember anything and went out again . &quot;
she did not seem to distur@@ b that she observed someone - or to think about the person who might under certain circumstances buy the pants which she had tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in Kent , said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take home pants with home who had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to draw clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash her .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in fol@@ k@@ stone . &quot;
all products that come into question were pulled out of sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Youtube could make it a bit safer for you .
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a nearby distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; if one approaches you from behind , then you should turn around , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; go out of the fir@@ ing line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the barrel and move back@@ wards while doing the weapon to him .
&quot; in case of att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the fir@@ ing line , grab the weapon and twist it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously shift the weight to the weapon and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon to it . &quot;

watch the video to see exactly how it is making Miz@@ ra@@ chi .

&quot; but the experiment , which was recorded under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ b of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left that he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate peculi@@ ar and wonderful things .
&quot; from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to flus@@ hing of toilets , the task put its immune system defini@@ tively below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , soil , wor@@ ms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
in the film he was confronted with his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample score showed a lumin@@ ous figure of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused , after its lumin@@ ous figure was more than 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel movie &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming who ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had made some of the things I instruc@@ ted him , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent reported that they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys before del@@ og@@ ging social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ oci@@ ale family left their social housing after a del@@ og@@ ging with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized its neigh@@ bors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Cor@@ n@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , they found sho@@ cked employees of the housing association property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were decorated cla@@ p holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for house administration at Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing , said she fears that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be regarded as not as beautiful part of Cor@@ n@@ walls .
the family is in@@ famous and its reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted was com@@ prised of street fights with bas@@ eball bats , inti@@ mid@@ ation , drug abuse , drug traff@@ i@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were stir@@ red up &quot;
neighbours told they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
del@@ og@@ ging were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neigh@@ bors who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t talk to anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the inn@@ um@@ erable times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing , said that it would have said the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ad@@ ministers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step that Cor@@ n@@ wall Housing is taking into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be horri@@ ble for their neigh@@ bors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Cor@@ n@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have been cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope this development will don@@ ate some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ging on the floor
workers of house administration will now have to clean up gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ ni@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a fine of money , after having found himself guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in commercial vision . &quot;
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth . &quot;
many room walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says they will del@@ og@@ ge ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Cor@@ n@@ wall shared with that the del@@ og@@ ging was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can be@@ have without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as to those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Cor@@ n@@ wall Police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal rel@@ oc@@ ated to panic after passing a ti@@ eff@@ lu@@ ous military jet beach
&quot; Sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ gal P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of the air forces put an unbeliev@@ able fall down
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk &quot;
&quot; this was the moment , in the frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ lu@@ ent jet cr@@ ashes over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video sho@@ ots showed how the military aircraft fle@@ w almost in tan@@ gible vicinity over the sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; holi@@ day@@ makers j@@ ump@@ ed when they started to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ s drives , without seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday makers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said , &quot; &quot; It really fle@@ w very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were stag@@ gering in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flo@@ ated unbeliev@@ ably deeply
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , so as to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said the jet was slightly lower than usual due to bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people came to death on Madeira island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his view &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

&quot; the Double@@ winner must refra@@ in from playing with the inf@@ erior cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europa League champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who argu@@ ed with Brazil the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing . &quot;

&quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ ri@@ que gave up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the candidates . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; also at the 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince . &quot;

mA Long in a private le@@ ague for table tennis gold
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; &quot; def@@ ending champion &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Jan@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; thus the world @-@ ranking @-@ chief won the &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia @-@ podium was the former S@@ VS @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between sentences and time outs , they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
they had gone back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ esters in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches up here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said tor@@ tured . &quot;
after the game was awarded gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the board and left Z@@ hang on a total of 13 points . &quot;
the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected col@@ der match .
&quot; however , nevertheless , there were sufficient stunning ball changes to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ se had taken a ri@@ b injury , after that , in a medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become similarly high table tennis @-@ old Olympia @-@ V@@ oted . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ amed ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire had such a thing as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ li@@ can camp from the race , the doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have violent problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame be false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he again picked up his famous media shi@@ fts . &quot;
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds wo@@ ke up
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ i from June , Tr@@ ump and his bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy were at the same time by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endanger@@ ed , AZ and Georgia are also regarded as endanger@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he makes nothing different than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it was al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will appeal to the Congress more strongly for Congress . &quot;

the I@@ OC wants to set up a discipline of discipline .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro Un@@ ge@@ ede Olympics .
&quot; following a fraud attempt at a Dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee distributed , promp@@ tly , to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , took a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya by the Dop@@ ing Controll@@ ers .
the I@@ A@@ AF World Association has developed the I@@ OC for information about the case in order to en@@ force their own investigations and distributed an I@@ A@@ AF spokes@@ person .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the I@@ OC , I@@ A@@ AF will evaluate an evaluation , &quot; said it in an I@@ A@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed down the trial and signed , &quot; &quot; declared Kenya Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was about 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan Athletics @-@ deleg@@ ate leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio games . &quot;
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money payments from his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya stands for numerous dop@@ ing attempts at the I@@ OC for a long time under special observation .
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls launched by the I@@ OC in front of the Rio games , it was unusual beforehand that especially athletes of Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency exer@@ cised a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports , the ARD has repeatedly been alle@@ g@@ ated that in Kenya the dop@@ ing means are readily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar examination in Kenya , as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport @-@ art was nation@@ wide and systematically de@@ vised . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
the Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tra@@ gic couple , similar to Romeo and Juliet . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s master@@ piece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
she re@@ members with sad@@ ness with Tony while the younger Lady plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there were Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so an honor for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous human being .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ oll@@ ers went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are just as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London school girls , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e , said that her family came from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ ten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks that are associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from east London went to a plane in direction to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
sult@@ anas family was told that she married an IS@@ IS com@@ bat@@ ant in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton appointed Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have affir@@ med Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land , and he spec@@ ulate . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Republi@@ can blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he also stated , Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency . &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants to become a nu@@ b for women and men .
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David BEL@@ LE@@ MER@@ E to issue a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked humans , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ play@@ boys was distingu@@ ish@@ able , as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he believes that it does the calendar too . &quot;
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with Cur@@ sed Cur@@ sed
&quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the office of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
Kur@@ dish community Germany expects thousands of prot@@ ectors to flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the group Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the tough for@@ ging of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Municip@@ ality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with some hundred thousand seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already over@@ taken Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the failed put@@ sch , there are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Tur@@ ks . &quot;
many will want to re @-@ start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state , which takes up refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the chief officer accused the targeted displac@@ ement of Syrian Arab Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erd@@ og@@ an wanted to increase the reis@@ su@@ e to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been era@@ dic@@ ated or displac@@ ed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government called for &quot; &quot; as shar@@ ply as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , a witch @-@ hunt against Erd@@ og@@ an critics take place . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a quality follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and pra@@ ises Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Tur@@ ks already placed the largest group of asylum entitled asylum entitled to asylum in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all accepted as a &quot; &quot; asylum @-@ entitled &quot; &quot; ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; this survey does not take place before war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum authority according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go , where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the state parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; so far , stup@@ id than so far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land p@@ ile struggle - this is bit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tive war@@ ri@@ ors , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the holi@@ day@@ makers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; there are also practical problems : in the holidays hel@@ pers who hang on posters , bu@@ bb@@ les , distribute air bal@@ lo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count votes at the end , only lab@@ ori@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the elec@@ toral and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign shortly before the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous campaign , one sees from its large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it already did his legendary word@@ kar@@ ar predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel gu@@ ilt on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create that , &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will now pres@@ um@@ ably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with her leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has been invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to Groß@@ kund@@ gen@@ ungen ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group didn &apos;t vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it p@@ ity no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U res@@ umes the usual election campaign on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this is what Kok@@ ert believes , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country , it is br@@ ittle the base that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any place in the sides of the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ toral fought against his co @-@ workers is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot of stake in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
in 2011 the SPD was still clearly winning with 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to make the lea@@ p into parliament . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and spend their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; is the name of the regional president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green WAH@@ L@@ K@@ Ä@@ MP@@ F@@ ER goes on track search for native voc@@ alists among holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ates with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
your impressions : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
there is nothing to compla@@ in about the speed with which the B 27 is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.@@ 30am in the morning , and only at about 20 o &apos;clock , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , the construction site could be moved to the south as scheduled for half @-@ time , until the end of October everything should be completed . &quot;
&quot; the remun@@ eration of those responsible for the construction work is also v@@ owed , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the block of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ sheim is lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation in the place has eased . &quot;
citizens can now move from O@@ fter@@ sheim into the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive movement through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the dep@@ uty head office manager Florian King for the management of the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ ler@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
what led to the fact that many lor@@ ries in residential areas fail .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality sought to rein@@ force the vehicle of M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made herself aware of the situation on the spot . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute engraved .
the fastest was on the way with 77 mph in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been continued , however , it became more quiet . &quot;
for business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look at the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales growth , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight decrease &quot; &quot; at the car @-@ ership @-@ Ma@@ ier too , but also adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; course of course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we have to be happy about each Euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; sales were attri@@ but@@ able to sales . &quot;
&quot; the street number@@ ing was &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss the half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , which would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , white from other or@@ bit@@ es , where a little more generous was handled . &quot;
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot walk , it is also elsewhere beautiful . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his tri@@ bal client@@ ele will come back to the end of the renovation work .
&quot; in spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly being screw@@ ed to laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Minister of Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a d@@ ull@@ ness to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable by the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not ask anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also take part in this .
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , however , he was on results and on a &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; according to recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has left a little time to present its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , adverti@@ sed : that a new security authority shall take care of the encryption of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second start for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups to pun@@ ish and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that I have no chances at the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people before de@@ port@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and dis@@ close social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in case of appe@@ als for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some worse than hi@@ ther@@ to - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal .
some are still un@@ balanced and questions are answered .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient , for example , the question arises : what has this actually to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that people were deeply concerned , could not be cl@@ amped up in election campaigns . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elec@@ toral fights . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking a position on the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the two parties went on high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ant@@ y argument about the furnis@@ hing of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the bos@@ ses also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a rejection of the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also strug@@ gling for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a departure from the double pass , he kept nothing . &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ make it do not make sense .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it still has to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ position itself in the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further enhance safety . &quot;

but not in all markets it is running around .
&quot; in the case of the recall action , there is a fuss about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start deliveries to the second half @-@ year during deliveries .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car park can continue to be a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened above all in Western Europe and thus res@@ umed the overall sales , such as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries carried out almost one sixth . &quot;

&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , too , the British vote on withdrawal from the EU also said a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the ab@@ at@@ ars first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the primarily affected home brand of the Lower Saxony is still further worse by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
group sales head Fred Kap@@ pler could further demonstrate a sales spl@@ us from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with software exhaust tests .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the bus stops the customer after the conversion , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as announced on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
reason is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for re @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday VW amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry committee , and the KBA Complete . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion , and all vehicle @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers can come back to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , to prevent uncertainty regarding possible warranty regimes , as it was said . &quot;
therefore VW uses the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;

the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not have a signal : normal as@@ par@@ agus would not have to be afraid to pay pen@@ alties for their savings .
&quot; if banks invest money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee will be charged by Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has spent 40 million euros for some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to another and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; said the Bank Princip@@ al . &quot;
&quot; I cannot pay for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the cost is now forwar@@ ded according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; simply letting the cash lie in the v@@ aults of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Bank Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear it alone , be &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically not possible permanently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits on deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele , which is a bit la@@ vis@@ h of wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; , &quot; if it &apos;s free money . &quot;
&quot; the G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ tach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; is currently no other bank known to charge a compensation for private customers deposits , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the German Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ blatt and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go into the negative , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not enjoy themselves in the width .
destination She@@ ets : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged dear records .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to the comment part , to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non@@ stop men &apos;s mid@@ wife with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ birth of sound plates is not on a boom in mill@@ enium , who want to gre@@ et the news of physical objects , but to be attributed to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group . &quot;
it is also not hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wil@@ dly stu@@ ffy before I stand , hold my hands and tell something certain like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic plate @-@ specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I haven &apos;t followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : he is now able to purchase records that he could not afford when they appeared and buying items that he sold when he was young and pl@@ agu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who purchase records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media lover , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been emp@@ tied by 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves , from objects that wake up happy attitudes . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
that &apos;s the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal spirit@@ ually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff is bl@@ us@@ hing out of a stack of plates . &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while through a p@@ ile of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ mit@@ es smo@@ other . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men of middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radio oh@@ ead record , so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;

we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who come to fru@@ ition . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I go into . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age@@ j@@ ungs and middle aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ be@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks son@@ ically isolated , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it tends to be a man@@ ne@@ quin than a bu@@ st@@ ling .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records ... &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the impression to pattern the je@@ ans @-@ hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ a@@ gem@@ s group@@ ing for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compla@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for lux@@ uries like plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research findings showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , have un@@ taken into account the large number of female collectors , which exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees by plates of the Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator that domin@@ ates nothing of the middle aged men over the shoulders . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects deal on demo@@ li@@ tion of stores in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a court hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais ar@@ gues that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provis@@ ional shops in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
&quot; humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also indicated that provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provis@@ ional business , but admitted that the pre@@ f@@ ecture of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture is absolutely understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feed people living in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas provide tran@@ quil meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the low @-@ travel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum items for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers during the summer . &quot;

&quot; Germany &apos;s r@@ aser has to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are to be over@@ l@@ apped very effectively . &quot;
the fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement Trailer by Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement .
&quot; for example , on highway constructions or to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate bridges with temporary gates , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit can be observed there . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , while the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be acquired over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through messages at time , driving strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer by car with trailer h@@ itch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also van@@ ish outer shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itzer against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 items last year . &quot;
great Britain scores silver in 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold rec@@ alls
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt stop at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro stage in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji has a master@@ class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line @-@ up and raw power to win Gold - their first match in the Olympic stadium of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad prize of the Silver med@@ al - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former leader for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost under Ryan every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here it is lost only one .
&quot; this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mira@@ cul@@ ously and caused the attack to boun@@ ce the GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving co@@ aches . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was running in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a guar@@ ded T@@ ackle from Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua had a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning since the re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB brought fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of the South @-@ Pacific , whose fans sang , agile and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff so@@ unded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked crus@@ hed in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown took the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ orton sa@@ iled the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scor@@ ed a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver med@@ al . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more emot@@ ive gold than with these games and that wants what is called .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment on the Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa .
&quot; even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 39.@@ ter uns@@ killed bet , which is also un@@ preced@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant men who slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the way of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and no one was more instrumental than the trainer who did not know about 30 months ago , if cancer was diagnosed at all . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which held the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again . &quot;
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but it makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a week @-@ giving morning a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t have had a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t out to make something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding and her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
Fin@@ ally taken care of clarity for 31 years

the association is considered as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water manufacturers .
it was said some time ago in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .

&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin association , stands for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , fo@@ sters approximately 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and Ba@@ un@@ ah . &quot;
there are water delivery contracts for further towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water atten@@ d@@ ant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of Zw@@ eck@@ verb@@ andes in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency rates on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events it called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ modelling of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always taken up new innovations because water is life @-@ consuming and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ le &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he lived in the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a true practition@@ er , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District Water Forum . &quot;
he received a lot of praise and praise for this .

steel - light view for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which the industry threatened from the green electricity subsi@@ dy , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition from the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said German economic minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a charter agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when generators are replaced in the steel plants , an E@@ EG lev@@ y is 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own electricity generation .
thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely fixed .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special meaning .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; climate and employment targets are also wei@@ ghted in the reform of the emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suff@@ ers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation has intensi@@ fied further than the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China cast massive steel onto the world market in view of the we@@ aker domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers throw up Chinese steel concerts in price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation has a little relaxed .

&quot; at the end of 2015 , some 86@@ 000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
in July the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , such as the Steel Industry Association on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced crowd went back to the second month after a row . &quot;

&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard Hack@@ ler from the German Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes h@@ ack@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; by means of regular co@@ hes@@ ion , sen@@ iors can establish and cultiv@@ ate social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures often dis@@ solve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , means h@@ ack@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation . &quot;
those who demand his lungs regularly even in everyday life are not so fast out of the pu@@ ff .
&quot; even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the sen@@ iors organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority ; it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , expla@@ ining it . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; by lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , self @-@ cent@@ red people sing for long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on their own voice and a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people who live alone , practice not only to focus on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir says h@@ ack@@ ler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; showing yourself : if I do something for a long time , I will be better and alert over me - this experience strength@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people , who list@@ ens when a tone is next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says Hack@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the acquaint@@ ance circle in a sen@@ iors choir , one can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to sing , you should join a choir , advis@@ es Hack@@ ler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover which effect the calls of cats have on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the ch@@ ew@@ ing also didn &apos;t let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cats at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ itten , who found themselves in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ HH ) have found out . &quot;
K@@ ater also respon@@ ds to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the M@@ HH . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es diff@@ ers with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ HH .
they were played for a herd of babies who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
&quot; they turned out faster to the loudspeaker , when this ru@@ stle of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played . &quot;
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or evol@@ ving with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r has been issued an arrest warran@@ t .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is once again taking place an important football game . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the Erz@@ gebirge between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; already during the arrest of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
there will be no stop before football .
&quot; against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kis@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
&quot; although initially for 90 days a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state of emergency is still valid until October , but in fact this has no effect on the lives of most Tur@@ ks . &quot;
the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday completed .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into practitioners and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the labor club Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the gross den@@ ial of the Tur@@ ks is the strict ref@@ usal of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; at 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as the top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scor@@ ed the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team to the cup .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave the League in the European League early . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we succeeded and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set up the basis of the 14th title with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch king . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; on the occasion of the AC Florence under the contract , and on Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as , only bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez had announced after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say it , &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club leader Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the stor@@ mer would have to be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce around one third of its worth of approximately 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clari@@ fied : &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence can not pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have won medals chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin had already been closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other super@@ vised athle@@ tic sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers , Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing lock their start right before the games , was fl@@ ur@@ less and wi@@ dened with their start ( 100 metres breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizar@@ re scene : with a super@@ imposed smile , she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a stand@@ point , that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ sturm . &quot;
&quot; however , there are many more sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversi@@ al figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed twice for two times ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion will run even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month ban after taking the pain relief by Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 World Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and the European Championship has been tested positive on the For@@ bidden stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ ko@@ vic fought the wis@@ sent@@ ee intake and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive for 2010 and 21 months were closed . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible for mer@@ ging Mer@@ ritt .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete won so many medals afterwards . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after it was established in it testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the Bronze med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognised , with@@ drew from the international sporting court CAS . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world ranking . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world government and gold fav@@ ori@@ de was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old World Champion , references were found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the Sper@@ re of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ ent@@ error in Thailand - Viol@@ in injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it . &quot;
her home trip was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands in constant contact with the local authorities , so lace . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in , initially on Thursday evening , explo@@ ded two bom@@ bs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and a further person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police data . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , then another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a town . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower be@@ et in front of the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations demanded several wounded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks wear the same signature , &quot; said Ar@@ med Forces Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not stand in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities had kept secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country , but they were not informed about the exact date and place . &quot;
&quot; still , it is not clear which group is behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; police instruc@@ ted their officials all over the country to enhance security for major government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not resort to tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years from Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Adul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai safety authorities in a serious way . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) paid for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings . &quot;
&quot; following confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , no necessary journeys to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
&quot; jun@@ ta Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bom@@ bs were an attempt to p@@ amp@@ er chaos while the country is heading for stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , has made herself good to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting hold of the rebel@@ lion of Muslim rebels strug@@ gling for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity of the identity &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office of constitutional law . &quot;
&quot; after several regional offices , the constitutional guards in the federal government have also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ar movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said constitutional manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that &apos;s why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is directed against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through over@@ l@@ apping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Niedersachsen , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity @-@ revolution@@ aries . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he said , his authority in the decision was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the principal officer . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a wor@@ rying advertising for their own cause .
the propaganda is supposed to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there were reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; and he said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and thus becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a constant influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ arten said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be legal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other legal entities or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nation@@ wide or European @-@ wide control of legal @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable . &quot;
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ arten said that many gri@@ ps went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum lod@@ g@@ ings were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimin@@ als or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed before with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been indiffer@@ ent to political indiffer@@ ence , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist tendencies . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was not just a sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate nevertheless at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received special start@@ ling from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well known .
&quot; since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; some media called it &quot; &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of wh@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; well @-@ being , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he hit the 100 metres of fre@@ estyle only with a minute and almost five seconds , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; an unforgettable one was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of free space alone . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old lear@@ nt to swim only eight months before Olympia and never had such a long distance before the competition .

post increases in trade with electric transport
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously big .
the Post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Street@@ sco@@ oter .
&quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post wishes to offer its electric vehicles on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been checking for months , whether they are to sell their own developed Street@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets to sell to other businesses . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ Management Jürgen Ger@@ des had said , there are always re@@ peti@@ tions , such as crafts@@ men . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
Ger@@ des announced that the Group intends to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and put forward a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;

fi@@ bre@@ glass @-@ management steps down after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K shares his head Matthias Hartmann .
the in@@ cis@@ ions came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K imag@@ ined that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is all the more uns@@ afe , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nürn@@ berger Markt@@ forschung company Gf@@ K : after re@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the resign@@ ation of corporate governance , the number five of the industry is in front of a new beginning . &quot;

the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect on September 12 .
&quot; the management of the Executive Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger as of 1 September , distributed the company . &quot;
&quot; he will officially assume the function of a &quot; chief executive , &quot; until a successor is found for Hartmann . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the in@@ cis@@ ions , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;

&quot; in investor relations , it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , last but not least , the dis@@ appointment of the continued successes of the restructuring carried out years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hartmann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each stock@@ owner will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company had failed to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales grew by 6.1 percent below the comparable figure of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; based on the first half of the year , sales tot@@ aled € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; the profit in the second quarter , above all , has stressed the company &apos;s sun@@ ken value in view of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the corporate advertising revenues of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience division have secured a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million in the Group under the bottom line . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : 8 wounded
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police reported . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give her data to an opposite hold , which drove partly on the counter @-@ road . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency doctor came to the accident ort on the provin@@ cial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement coach of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called for the lor@@ ry tan@@ ker and possible witnesses to contact the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic metre of wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater will be from 1 October 2016 to the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 euro area instead of 2,@@ 10 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / lo@@ pp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater fee will be further increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; following an extensive calculation , the wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that under@@ deck@@ ings were under@@ going for these wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal principles , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ covering . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 onwards , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , lo@@ pp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to fall deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt appeared to the Board , a new calculation of fees for the wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater facilities of the market was necessary . &quot;
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 should be compens@@ ated for over@@ - or under@@ cover@@ ings from the previous calculation period .
&quot; with all three wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater facilities , Schmidt explained that there are relatively small establishments with a very low wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater treatment , which lie between 68@@ 00 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater volume in all three systems is slightly dec@@ lining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the back period of the calculation , all three systems were not least due to their age of renovation and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the equipment for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and lo@@ pp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the se@@ wage plant of Az@@ endorf due to damage .
&quot; in the pump@@ ing station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and replaced by the first se@@ wage plant after nearly 20 years , the se@@ wage slu@@ dge has to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility must be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still below the current level with the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water fall in the three plants the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance are fully under@@ gone .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt comple@@ mented the market community of large entertainment costs in the wa@@ st@@ ew@@ ater facilities in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned plants will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ous in view of stone houses in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wage federation in order to avoid these plants is because it is a defic@@ it . &quot;
Bulgaria takes up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; housing , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect critic@@ ised as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is un@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are distinctive , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools , which generate more than 30 million new sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all errors will come to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of making the app black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them s@@ lot@@ ty eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics notified a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indi@@ gn@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter rec@@ alled in@@ viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote about the photos widely that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and bar@@ k &quot; was un@@ comfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very gru@@ es@@ ome Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not le@@ thal , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the abnormal extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s large audience of young people - who are different from breed different than their older counter@@ parts - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that fast @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu cri@@ tici@@ zed the majority of white , only male leaders , and finished their ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or good to say . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely abandoned Snap@@ chat . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , in turn , said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;

&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence @-@ related information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions were allowed on site , reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Defence , Intelligence Committee , and the Military bud@@ get@@ ary com@@ bat@@ ant , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret services , which reported how superior their ass@@ ess@@ ments changed to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders typically recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site , and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed descriptions in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Ira@@ qi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to the fact that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts are exposed to pressure from their superior laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of the Congress were significantly more positive than facts , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military rec@@ ap@@ ture Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress MP from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that anal@@ ysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigations are continued .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports by the general insp@@ ector of the Ministry of Defence is under@@ way . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of re@@ direc@@ ting ass@@ ess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; stated the highest level of Democrats in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence @-@ related reports , &quot; compens@@ ated the mor@@ ality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; gave exc@@ es@@ sively little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the White House &apos;s intervention in the Cent@@ com anal@@ ysts with regard to &quot; &quot; certain political opinions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general insp@@ ector , who were accepted after Com@@ pla@@ ints of Cent@@ com anal@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon Press Officer , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while investig@@ ating general insp@@ ections were still under@@ way . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have di@@ verg@@ ent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense gre@@ et a controversi@@ al discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigation proceeds on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of the last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State remin@@ is@@ cent of inter@@ rup@@ tions of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a let@@ tering on how the then government under George W. Bush met only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebel@@ lion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker announced that the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these tent@@ ative refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ au@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the legislat@@ ure for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games were supposed to represent a worthy achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not recall that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , she knows this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams within their group will reach the first and second place each . &quot;
the first place will take the strong Dutch slightly longer from the path that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may run on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey bat in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team all went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the next year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Englis@@ h@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work ens@@ um in London that we now have .
we have completely w@@ ri@@ pped the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back hand@@ shake from the near area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and stopped playing from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and plu@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament &apos;s door@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .

&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , it &apos;s the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Jan@@ eiro &apos;s events feel constant and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed relay race between competition and pursu@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning staff , which is passed by the b@@ rist@@ le to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is a Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ an@@ band with dimples , could have been quite among those known names that would be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if it were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ na@@ sts or even f@@ encing . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not immediately illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule long .
&quot; but if I should modest enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline diving has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it became so spar@@ se that many people , I had ques@@ tioned , did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; despite the fact that the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a med@@ al in the trampoline and until 2012 has achieved an ath@@ l@@ ete who made it until the end of the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russi@@ ans tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it is more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n school that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an inher@@ ited enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ish tre@@ mb@@ ling of its never ending boun@@ cing - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym@@ nas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much like &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ edge and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to official Olympic program according to performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common oly@@ mp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold , they have to go further , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further under@@ mining goal in tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ions : the world or the Olympi@@ ast@@ on . &quot;
&quot; pur@@ pos@@ eful quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel more ti@@ ring when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seem@@ ingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a After@@ noon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ look at the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by creating and objec@@ ti@@ zing male ath@@ l@@ ete - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his air @-@ bo@@ iling , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , who call for political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ g@@ led with the violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police at fire@@ arms .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government shi@@ fted the country and expanded into ever more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ cil@@ ess according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave that polic@@ emen shot and killed ou@@ tri@@ ght dis@@ armed prot@@ esters .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights agency now requires a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; according to Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight against the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to supp@@ ress the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited , with dis@@ si@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile , or to prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the governing coalition .
&quot; following an extensive vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the ten@@ sions rise along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversi@@ al line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; anal@@ ysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts , like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front , or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , have been forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence over the past few years and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of exposure to the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate about internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered in such a way as protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ asa , the two greatest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ h@@ are are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ h@@ as , predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ h@@ ā@@ na and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ h@@ ā@@ ras and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is predomin@@ ately dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , had until his death on an un@@ pub@@ li@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly ens@@ hr@@ ined in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and use Special Represent@@ atives to process opponents , and to make them harm@@ less . &quot;
&quot; the present regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ ested against elections , which were apparently mandatory by the government according to analy@@ st statements and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
anal@@ ysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for flying over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin atro@@ city . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim that Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday saying that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &apos; pres@@ idential candidates whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
&quot; it also brings its comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculi@@ ar position to declare statements which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the ap@@ ologies utterly serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement , remember@@ ing that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can pres@@ idential candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism thre@@ w down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he has tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign for falling demand values on economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept spe@@ eches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech d@@ ull . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already provided sar@@ cas@@ m for his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russi@@ ans were supposed to ch@@ op Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later , &quot; &quot; Of course I told the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ ending the tone for the pres@@ idential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even tone , because its cargo values continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head racing in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to not exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expressions , he frequently accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ or . &quot;
&quot; but while he is increasingly focusing on the focus of attention during the last months of his pres@@ idential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the un@@ comfortable situation to stand , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps of prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that prior to Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it h@@ ind@@ ran@@ gers , completely false and so it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most ma@@ instream repub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread themselves in order to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; prior to the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being able to travel around him and pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ated against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , twi@@ light &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked at Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ ologies as merely another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idential office .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fancy cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue have been displac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set up in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people affected it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , except the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also re @-@ finding . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he began working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide money for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a great deal . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with b@@ acon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish tops such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are king@@ doms .
&quot; the café serves no beer anymore , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a constant stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after closing the verb , she gave a coffee break for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarter to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ ch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with b@@ acon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he didn &apos;t feel any gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for decor@@ ating with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into the offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to polish , and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local saff@@ ron restaurant would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee to the bottles .
there is a chance that the café exp@@ ands to an adjacent building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favourites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell this , &quot; he said . &quot;
de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; the menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and des@@ sert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane I@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; Co@@ es &apos;s last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small schn@@ itz@@ ky snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese sand@@ wich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; as the repor@@ ter h@@ ew@@ ed h@@ ew@@ ed f@@ ry , this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ brot , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and Bohn@@ enb@@ rot . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it must have placed itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet . &quot;
&quot; men of women cooked for mas@@ cul@@ ine rocks and it was served fresh@@ ly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways that the country turned out to be no longer the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when the American food was a central , stressed topic , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole have become the stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ produce food resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man noticed that ch@@ efs could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
unique mix@@ tures have been tried since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish of this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes on : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other .
it was typical for many of the domestic business recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - did the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeper &quot; and the challenge to turn p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ Eating behaviour . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he sa@@ iled as the millions of millions of millions of world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonder@@ fully realistic .
&quot; President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ itment of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes of Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversi@@ al . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods . &quot;
the couple gave the food habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood when writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the case of the wind @-@ bag .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a des@@ sert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um des@@ sert that President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everybody de@@ vol@@ ved some rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E repe@@ aled three times a supplement .
&quot; he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot;
killed in bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died during a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a Civil Protection Group , who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives on the game , to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil war , showing him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said loud to the picture : &quot; for me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I dying to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the recent bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ op@@ ters have dropped four drum bom@@ bs across the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terr@@ orists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ ks get only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average straight 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade magazine &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist assumed a long time , that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is stone @-@ old . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ ie lifestyle .
her time pent@@ ine beha@@ ves as she re@@ compens@@ ated six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; prey make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of the polar sea and look for car@@ c@@ asses , which tor@@ so from higher layers of water . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 cen@@ timeter was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of shar@@ ks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the lens is already created before the birth of shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
&quot; therefore , according to the early 1960s , her birth was to lie in the atmosphere of a nuclear weapon search for larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the left nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon dioxide from the nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate his 50@@ th birthday in his investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in its len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us , all larger Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon 14 amounts on the other hand , which results in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 493 centimet@@ re long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k should be even 392 years old with 502 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to the length . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold to the sex@@ ually mature , and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this might be world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ as live mainly in icy waters , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 years old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose b@@ acon at the neck was a 120 @-@ year old Har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on spar@@ ks . &quot;
so they mature later - and age s@@ lower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very big animal should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
Nag@@ y@@ ti@@ la@@ j : lovely cottage at the edge of the village
the municipal council has foc@@ uss@@ ed on topics around building in the recent meeting .
&quot; with relief , the Panel took the message from mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the real estate , par@@ enth@@ ood and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on sur@@ ve@@ ying , there is nothing more in the way to the sale of land in the residential building areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße ) . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the B@@ auf@@ lä@@ chen appe@@ als to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ lig can immediately report to the town hall , which is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots to the Municipal Council in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet even requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , connected to the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the area of space that was newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the industrial area is already wi@@ dened by two plots in the direction of Unter@@ time@@ er@@ n in the direction of the 21@@ 12 state road . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; accordingly , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money houses can continue to operate from London financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient for them to be admitted to the UK . &quot;
this is why large US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is expecting 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance policy EI@@ OP@@ A and the risk situation ES@@ RB . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quar@@ tered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg heated a large fund industry , but just as in Dublin as the infrastructure deteri@@ or@@ ates . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city features easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of Mer@@ cer &apos;s consulting firm , the city stands on No.@@ 7 , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin in No.@@ 33 and Paris on 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s vote in Europe , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my business researchers . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead ob@@ tains legal costs from h@@ epatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co .
&quot; in June gil@@ ead exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were covered in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ esis and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was raised on Thursday , US Secretary of State Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the decree of the costs arising during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead to the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took advantage of each other and took property on laboratory work that so@@ f@@ os@@ bu@@ vir prev@@ ailed , active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ a@@ ined full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the US have reg@@ a@@ ined full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left these , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are passing through the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried itself within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters . &quot;

Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax declaration on Friday , which resulted in the pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats and her husband income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton bought an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards on financial transparency , &quot; gave Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and tra@@ ilers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is custom@@ ary for US pres@@ idential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign by Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the release of the pres@@ idential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax insp@@ ections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ umps critics , including the Republi@@ can pres@@ idential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his ref@@ usal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business forms and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax declaration .
on Thursday she talked about the topic during a speech about the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other pres@@ idential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a subject . &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate took his seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to an IR@@ S tax test and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the vot@@ ers and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax declaration back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 109@@ .000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with chim@@ neys , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
environ@@ ment@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x species to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ds .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already been the idea for years ago , intensi@@ fied its funding together with U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harv@@ ests without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can ab@@ stain from their fields without dam@@ aging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bu@@ bb@@ les in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; so@@ lic@@ itation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not see an Israeli pres@@ election , since there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how did it happen in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and destroyed ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel announced that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels management .
the reason behind it solved even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was c@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this was borne in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a pretty big resonance in the internet , where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some sub@@ mits to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would have been the alleged call of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed : it was in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located on the class@@ y Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a syn@@ agogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dism@@ is@@ sed all alle@@ g@@ ations of himself and called the incident to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not enter the key@@ note list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police Com@@ es Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ u@@ ums against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students joined the police on Thursday in Sa@@ o Paulo , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police used tear gas and rubber sho@@ ots against prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officer , the students tried to disper@@ se what led to the police force of Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protests were held by Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits against the provis@@ ional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the latest protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ is@@ sed by a vote by the Senate for their dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to Russian amb@@ assador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the sales approach between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies in business in the country grew strongly , distributed the amb@@ assador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the sales up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the amb@@ assador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is moving from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representative issued approximately 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries concerning the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russi@@ ans attend Iran , something from which the amb@@ assador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

in the sec@@ lu@@ ded leisure style hard@@ t@@ wä@@ ld@@ le the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was quar@@ tered during the first school week .
several full day trips were on the program .
on the one hand we went to boards with the visit of the match z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other after Maul@@ bronn , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third outing resulted in P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bronn led to the jumping , swimming and splash . &quot;
&quot; culinary , children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers were spo@@ iled with their own cour@@ ters , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful jewels made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; . &quot; &quot;

ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims at the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors from the Ey@@ ak@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna &apos;s past@@ oral care unit were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ ance trip of all the ministers in a period of two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the open gate of mercy on the Freiburg Cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was required . &quot;
&quot; 16 min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bronn , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern are on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Par@@ ish Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and told the pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster &apos;s beloved wife stands and so the pilgrimage route was started by Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , each with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and scrip@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on Feld@@ kreu@@ zen , chap@@ els or churches were again and again to sing a song from specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
for the nights the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were at your disposal .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller attended the stage targets for a tasty and strengthened dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ t@@ wan@@ gen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags on this one entered the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of the road , had to start off at first approximately 500 metres altitude and then climb@@ ed back afterwards . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue on the beach in the evening .
after the morning im@@ pul@@ sion on the fourth pilgrimage church in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is met in the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and step@@ ped through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was given thanks to God . &quot;

&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
s@@ ot@@ ted Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ged last evening in the male team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow received the an@@ chor@@ age , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . the J@@ unker made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after being in March at the railway world champ@@ ionships in London , despite the resign@@ ation of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a sign up .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y wins - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic record in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; behind it was slightly back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y held the team forward and Sk@@ inner has held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great part of the transformation , when exec@@ uting in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; in the final round , we installed an Olympic record and the world champion defeated . &quot;
it was just unbeliev@@ able .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the victory in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that he fell on the track after a weak start . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such a prev@@ ent@@ ative victory .
&quot; said , &quot; &quot; It feels with all the GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have so badly taken away with so many tit@@ els , that it was unbeliev@@ able to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation winning seven of ten titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
with the shape of Kenn@@ ys it is possible in the area of the possibility that he repeatedly wins Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y , who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver med@@ al . &quot;
this is the case of Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next to the Sprint , which starts today and will go for three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ al contest of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ l qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilomet@@ re race . &quot;
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 .
&quot; world record , winning in London Gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.6@@ 59 . &quot;

&quot; after a truly extraordinary depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; there were drama in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing actors as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks quite like that the now legendary call GB@@ s , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the removal of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the port@@ land of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand in the game , as the plant operator termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years is scheduled in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ places - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in case of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ance effects since the melt mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total output of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry enam@@ el , leading the closure of the An@@ gl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the many years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ter with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p keep smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through melt production , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging outlets &quot; , &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L reported that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; ability to operate the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the enam@@ el . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation why it has resign@@ ed from the contract . &quot;
anal@@ ysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before possible closing of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the co@@ vet@@ ed September issue of the US V@@ ogue . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der , brand amb@@ assador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizar@@ re ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , sc@@ anned reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ denom@@ in@@ ator family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and ending with a classical twist : they have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this portra@@ ys the cl@@ er@@ ic@@ ee@@ zed act almost every birthday episode ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a mu@@ st@@ ard at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , security has started a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as regards the V@@ ogue Cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for V@@ ogue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is rather similar to an image band than a fashion magazine , the output pul@@ ls a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling unit 615 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who model &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar pri@@ zew@@ inner and Di@@ or brand amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was on cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people , or reality stars or you@@ ths from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on their denom@@ in@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are emerging in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the release J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but lying on the dis@@ grace seems to pass by at the point .
k@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jacob@@ s .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold by her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine &quot; LOVE . &quot;
and in her free time she can see her in Reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; congreg@@ ational centers show 16@@ 0,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ .000 of the country &apos;s hel@@ pers will be reported annually by the community centers , while the industry is taking on the effects of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , ne@@ edy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair del@@ og@@ ations and similar - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the Director of the Community Centers of Community of Que@@ bec , James Far@@ rell stated that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Service Centr@@ es concluded that thousands of people have already been dism@@ is@@ sed every year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse , without the resolution of the Federal Government &apos;s resolution . &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s common district centers are chronic under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected of important services you need , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive deb@@ ts , families who have been dism@@ is@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dism@@ is@@ sed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of people in Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of communities and their communities , and that Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly took weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after she told her that her campaign manager for North Carolina was directed to a staff in February , while in February they were in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in a indictment filed by Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ i was waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be regulated internally , before he realised that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the train , and ramm@@ ing the race in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ oni gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after he had compla@@ ined about the local and regional campaign , Bord@@ oni found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; Bord@@ i said . &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment only comes two days after the Republi@@ can pres@@ idential candidate put out a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina said the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapons bud@@ dies should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign announced that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ur violence . &quot;

&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could almost go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 35.@@ 6 percent in five years to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party only blow@@ s just under the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversi@@ al between the Left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left were 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( before 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to enter the Schwerin Diet . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent .
&quot; according to the German parliament &apos;s choice of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the pol@@ l &apos;s SPD com@@ prised only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they still stood behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; by 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return that the pir@@ ates would miss in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched . &quot;
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes initially , which would today range for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an office in the West pocket format .
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax it was communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price of 2700 D @-@ Mark was rather proud , that is about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average selling price for a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 392 euros .
&quot; in August 1996 , no one could susp@@ ect that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the phone @-@ saving of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft . &quot;
today the market domin@@ ates providers that came all a lot later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users around the world . &quot;
&quot; around 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 555 million units were sold . &quot;
worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
&quot; the crucial breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple leader Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the after@@ thought . &quot;
&quot; finally , Black@@ berry spar@@ ed to fight . &quot;
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
today everybody looks at his mobile phone for 88 times a day .
&quot; we must all learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we will already create 10,000 new appren@@ tic@@ es@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will flash on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ f@@ ellers had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked by him . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn on wit@@ t@@ ingly growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the 2012 London games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row , and thereby secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass Ad Blo@@ cking , a &quot; &quot; K@@ atz@@ - und Maus@@ spiel &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertis@@ ements on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the encoding regarding his advertis@@ ements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ h@@ er battle between the attra@@ cting open source community and the conver@@ ts has been in progress since the invention of advertis@@ ers &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display blo@@ ckers have become for the industry .
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertis@@ ements Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has , apart from advertising blo@@ ckers on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ages have no effect on the Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agram , shared a spokes@@ person . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues so that Facebook will be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preference tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their commerci@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook spokes@@ person in an email communications . &quot;
&quot; ad blo@@ ckers are a bl@@ unt way , why we instead focus on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with pres@@ umed su@@ icide crossing the Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours passed on Thursday at a pres@@ umed su@@ icide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill himself by several vehicles , including a truck . &quot;
she still died on site .
&quot; several drivers were already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them , as well as any witnesses of the incident . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Cro@@ st@@ etter distributed the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman of neg@@ ligent murder was acqu@@ itted after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 of a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the road , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman rep@@ lied -- that had responded to a call -- based on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate model : Venus was formerly inhabit@@ able
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was probably inhabit@@ able . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that res@@ emble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent matter . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus expon@@ ates its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , which was similar to evolution , which was suspected of planetary research . &quot;
&quot; although it was pres@@ um@@ ably inhabit@@ able , Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several thousand years . &quot;
their oc@@ eans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their steam was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen@@ res escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations has to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
it also has to have a right of determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season , Roy was honored as the winner of the Jack Adams award as the best trainer in the le@@ ague during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal &apos;s Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .

&quot; the work struggles in relation to the remun@@ eration for North Sea workers will be exposed , while all the parties negoti@@ ate for a new round of discussion , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ c conducted on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the settlement process of the current strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks , starting next year to rest@@ art the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions told that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year Wood Group cuts rates to its contractors in the North Sea by some 9 percent , due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s ratings follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional reduc@@ tions give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ at@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower cru@@ de oil prices , an economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of approximately $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in star@@ ring to different rates , as well as in what connection the rotation time periods are related to planetary collapse . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through compar@@ ing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa &apos; Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
they turn on the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these mature star exp@@ els large quantities of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow@@ ing effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation speed begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn s@@ lower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turn s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while qui@@ cker rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us about what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak , hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ades ro@@ unding rates , which soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears run at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional resign@@ ation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will be wearing the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ ampa Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say Goo@@ dbye to join , &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Particip@@ ant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - in full sal@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , he paid tribute to Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to manage some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the fame hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversi@@ al his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was admitted to have taken away from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , due to the involvement of the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered as the main susp@@ ect to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time hoo@@ ked . &quot;
even his f@@ are@@ well days are not running no@@ is@@ eless@@ ly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball le@@ gends in their last games were still getting the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and to the conditions with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ age Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Goal @-@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Goal is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a caught athle@@ tin would have won almost a med@@ al .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases are known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro . &quot;
the Chinese float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Goal is tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news came to the un@@ timely .
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been detected , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old evi@@ den@@ ced the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only by 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the talks over 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) , the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing applied for the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the I@@ OC , but the CAS is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio , the news so@@ aked through the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said it &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the forbidden substance of the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended provis@@ ional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately appe@@ aled to criticism of the Athle@@ tin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fters may not take part in the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Goal &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another severe blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association I@@ A@@ AF had under@@ lined the whole Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the former off@@ ences in China had also taken care of heavy conflicts between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t grab@@ bed the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang res@@ sch .
&quot; Sun y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt , purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of freedom I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French Radio . &quot;
Sun was also the focus of a confron@@ tation with Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Sun was positively tested in the Chinese nation@@ als on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;

program@@ mers of Express @-@ Malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware specialists mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies were at least once in the past twelve months , partly several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail@@ ers software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; 40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the solutions demanded by the perpet@@ r@@ ators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially explosive ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are ob@@ serving a sc@@ ary rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Director Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertis@@ ements . &quot;
then the perpet@@ r@@ ators discovered ex@@ tor@@ tion software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an offering , it searches for recently modified files such as word@@ - , exc@@ el or database files as well as after archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of Bit@@ coin cryp@@ to@@ currency . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without making production stopp@@ able . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business operation completely , in a case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , hospitals already have been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of sick ac@@ utely . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , who pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of perpet@@ r@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure investigated the benefits of the user and the contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpet@@ r@@ ators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negoti@@ ate hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data back un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , declar@@ es safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; the previous malware kits have been created by buying malware , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , looks and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then are looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als are then pressur@@ ing sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be with@@ drawn by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ r@@ ators are pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ r@@ ators instead of publishing sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Director Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential of damage , depending on the type of data , is still a multiple higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ r@@ ators could have completely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con &quot; , &quot; security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat integrated with the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ r@@ ators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers in the first row and the rear have plenty of space , it does not seem tight in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls slightly . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; it is not only a case of 453 l in case of high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ essel and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the cargo height with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
&quot; however , he is likely to make his work qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine feature : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems belong to the City Emergency Brake Ass@@ ist ( works up to temp@@ o 32 ) , the col@@ lision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot;
&quot; the col@@ lision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; when man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; very reliable , the beam assistant works . &quot;
and the intelligent timing belt respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed if necessary .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and an HDMI socket are below the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well equipped top diesel is fine .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive from 20,000 euros , the diesel starting at 230@@ 00 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday vehicle . &quot;
Airline is not liable : fall on air passenger lift
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; because a liability is concei@@ vable only with haz@@ ards that are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee @-@ iron during the fall .
&quot; however , the accident would have been able to happen everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
disease : when paying the Organiz@@ er
&quot; after their journey , sick leave will only get money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have reported the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case , a family on the second day of their tower was sever@@ ely affected by di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective se@@ wage plant , which suppos@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea water . &quot;
the family was in the opinion that the trip had been in@@ adequate - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
&quot; indeed , the se@@ wage plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er first learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since there were no contamination in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were sick . &quot;
&quot; according to the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be con@@ scientious and determined at the same time to react to the terrorist risks .
certainly it is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ r@@ ators with hate and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not treat this triumph to the terr@@ orists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , this increased the security and also the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to implement proposals until 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personnel recru@@ itment of the security forces , namely &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit size order over several years . &quot; &quot;
promoting terrorism should be under punishment again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the tru@@ ce is to be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons in the internet will be difficult . &quot;
the recently much discussed tail light for doctors should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession , how the haz@@ ards of citizens can be reduced , he spoke with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers better social care . &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior was clearly opposed to action against action .
&quot; this was an ear file for the sni@@ pers in CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a ban on bur@@ ka and the ab@@ olition of double nationality .
he considers a general ban on full @-@ disgu@@ ise for constitutional law .
&quot; you can &apos;t do everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; green head @-@ chief Simone Peter thre@@ w the Minister , he wanted to deal with ever new anti @-@ terrorist acts of action and action . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet sa@@ y@@ ings and a sharpen@@ ing of the right of residence permit people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway zu@@ cht@@ inger
it st@@ alls regularly on the walk @-@ down street - here a picture of November .
but that is to change : the right @-@ to @-@ law version should be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are standing in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic , when driving through the motorway at the Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction is extended by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler street exit . &quot;
drivers can then go straight from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is divided early on , thereby improving the total workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger anno@@ ys the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 is shortly before the Wes@@ eler road exit .
from here the traffic is lo@@ wered only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rec@@ eded in a good one @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge was no longer the required load force , in order to record heavy @-@ duty traffic in two lanes above all . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related equivalent de@@ w continue , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art cannot be said . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remain@@ der of the remain@@ der of the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the provin@@ cial company deliberately sought the traffic @-@ we@@ aker time in the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will pass by on Tuesday and Wednesday on the construction site .
cross @-@ cultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge theater are planning a music project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the young theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students from 11 to 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee @-@ background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most adol@@ esc@@ ents of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z Wester@@ berg , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , drama and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and the@@ atri@@ cal language placement are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star sni@@ pers : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain for watching the cel@@ esti@@ al spect@@ acle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ row . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we surely see many clu@@ sters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the quick@@ est star @-@ escal@@ es with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night one is aw@@ ake for hours , in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how can sleep problems or sleep distur@@ bances ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , stressed Hans @-@ Günter we@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sleep and Sleep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what can be understood by it , but the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is an entry and sleep disorder . &quot;
&quot; currently , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the Board of Directors in the German Veter@@ inary Association , with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot;
not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; says we@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
&quot; for example , who has a disk failure , can lie bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worry , there &apos;s an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when to sleep with sleep distur@@ bances to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor .
&quot; im@@ pair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ rested , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out its causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should contact the primary doctor in case of sleeping problems . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , for example , in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ers , in case of disease @-@ fatigue , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ bre explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ bre . &quot;
&quot; after the cab@@ ling , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera shows the sleeping @-@ ends on the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on them ?
there are quite a lot of stu@@ d bolts that can be set for a better sleep .
&quot; shooting counts : regular bed@@ - and rise @-@ times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the Jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bert has vo@@ iced himself to the dis@@ appo@@ inting end of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time at the short@@ wave world champ@@ ionships in Doh@@ a , and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler , via Facebook , has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle king of 150@@ .000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not even see or operate on the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be stopped here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bert would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger who meanwhile operates a ice cream par@@ l@@ our . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Fe@@ ast arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civil war crimes of the Düsseldorf police were able to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and bag ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30@@ pm civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf recognised a gang , which was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several crimes and had been working together socially and professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the det@@ ective com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can show the thi@@ eves , which had been especially filed for crimes committed to Germany , to demonstrate four acts . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lef@@ to@@ vers , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from the east to the west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house someone &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , who will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; article on this trendy district , as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , is preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel pronounced several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police with 30 to 40 officials and three crew trucks on site , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners were the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late late . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who lives here three children , are generally anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to report a majority of police protection against the left . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ches , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police make up between house owners and their neigh@@ bors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; house occup@@ ations and the new home projects have long been part of the neighborhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Riga . &quot;
many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized while the Main@@ zer was under great police orders and were still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
&quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and elec@@ tive lin@@ ers from all over the world over the last few years : local residents from G@@ DR and former home owners share their neighborhood with them . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the rent , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ aer are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on the designed discs or newly painted fac@@ ades that have been thrown with dy@@ es .
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ alone violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem , it could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like physical injury are almost entirely directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences make damages , which tend to make the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house next to the controversi@@ al 94 for 17 years , there is no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not intended . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , will no longer exist in Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the architect , her street does not have a criminal focus on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga @-@ Straße - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important that the residents get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , which all of July suddenly claimed the interpretation of interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which supp@@ ress the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end these are con@@ dos , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never stops ?
&quot; there are fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws you should be aware of it - just like someone who is moving into a pub area , can compla@@ in badly about noise . &quot;
all persons presented with first names have therefore asked not to be named with their proper name .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organiz@@ er .
&quot; furthermore , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the asylum authority for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical ped@@ agogue supports the team of administration for Achim Gros@@ sen@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact person for all the actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the honor@@ ary officials are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ins@@ ul@@ ting Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing rather than focusing on the variety of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place . &quot;
&quot; a management consultant with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , has become an ins@@ ul@@ ent cow @-@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been involved for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years @-@ term .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers at Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting them .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented habit@@ ats .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Agriculture Office to the municipality and the Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de fac@@ to , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so far as to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be made , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be installed on the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , appren@@ tic@@ es@@ hips , training places , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be m@@ apped or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ne@@ at , as reported by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not just mean work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers such as sport , contact with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , there is also administration and honor@@ ary official . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it just takes and makes it sense to bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two after the recent events fear radic@@ alisation , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; What man@@ cher na@@ i@@ v might call . &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclu@@ de it . &quot;
&quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensitive . &quot;
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins bring them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; therefore , main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region . &quot;
they have always been in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly lies the policy .
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place them on site hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the ur@@ bach are already familiar with it , to integrate the people so far . &quot;
&quot; currently , these are around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Ker@@ cas@@ z@@ om@@ or : fom@@ er rec@@ tory in nice location in a small village
the police helic@@ opter fle@@ w different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are en@@ rolled in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. on Friday morning .
