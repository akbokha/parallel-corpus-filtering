<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, was looking for a little variation with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses arrived at their holidays, they hunted at the fast gallop home to the fodder."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself be led by his family about the annex of ALRV, on a horse he swore not even for photographic purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also with the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help handed over the man from Schaffhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="16">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already blamed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th winner of the Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first award winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro the same.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame of German Sports. ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP's Trade Agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential candidates are uncertain in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will drive regulations massively, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the future, Trump and Clinton have to be invested almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly refused by the state-critical Teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could be some party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-launch coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement intends to terminate."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme:" a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, they do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but just protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should be paid better then, for example, Clinton demands."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a minimum of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must get up, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics regard him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who at least want to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Executive Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and is concerned with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-ed women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs has made up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as hope for Europe," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women others outweigh other reasons for the escape:" many steal away from it, because they do not see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, honorary murderers, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, misses, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not know to help, there are more accommodations only for them, requires Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in the housing of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, refugees are not being accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franks, there are storeys or own houses in some common shelters and their own homes only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of women and gender equality" also calls for women to be accommodated separately by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together, there may be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this protective need can be read at the rush, which there is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have talked about it, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily create a second home.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC stated that the ministers would have agreed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students have agreed upon the rejection of a contract agreed with BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had" persistently calm "to problems, which led to the fact that the Treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has agreed to reject the proposed new contract fully and requested official re-negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today filed a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating labour campaign measures launched at the beginning of September."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot forbid myself that Ankara would most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrower and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly by his" "dear friend" "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if not anything bad happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's bright, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin dismissed and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Going on was even bigger since it was committed by a friend of mine.</seg>
<seg id="17">"rebuilding the cousins will be difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"at the earnest, the allegations of senior officials reported that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he was released last month at a failed coup d'état almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti described it as follows:" "tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry with the West, because its response to the attempted power takeover was regarded as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pired to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian state of State gained a bonus that after the attempted coup d" état, he demanded support for the elected officials. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well marked for Moscow, a matter of course, which has a deep fear of regiment."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" alliance of outsiders "as an analyst once described to me: two countries, who turn away from the West and feel badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks, both idents met at the press conference saying that they had not even striped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally missed a question of their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey has fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these stamps will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">"RBS has already said that it will no longer be possible to sponsor the Six Nations sponsorship, and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship."</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, for how do we concentrate on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" "said the Chief Executive Officer."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it means (in Russian) that he later became the director and staff leader of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin on his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state concerning laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step took Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff has resigned at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - embarrassed post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin has been a member of the KGB National Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was the Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov, one of five people, whom he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin could violate Putin's constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, affiliated company Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">"engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings with Viaduct, meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "Deckgebläse", "which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slashes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of engineering from a truly epic scale to this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of all the bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high-end and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or shore side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern bridgebridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweig affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mine: investors shall in future be required more strongly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next meeting, the SPD is proposing a" "Living plan". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Christoph Bratmann says: "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing.</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great point of dispute in the town hall is, however, said Bratman:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction programme, which will cost millions and still need to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, so Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program does not yet exist altogether, because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do we compare the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion is going to run over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning olitic spokesman Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">One stroke could solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the west city, the year-end dates are made."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing construction companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West city is again drastically increased, one removes from the goal of so-called intermingling."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors on screens, complained of many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena in pop culture, interest in the release of the game sank in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overburdened.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go was more user than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation playing the game when she was younger, joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game resulted in a significant increase in steps that the" average "person restores each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"cardio, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increased performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take" 30 minutes of time "" "" coming from the sofa "" and "" being active every day "" hit deaf ears, because many public messages are bored and coming from people who look elingly. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduces their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the Wonderful of Pokémon go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also murderers who have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has happened a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will continue with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="17">"it awaited them a final test in Brazil, a competition which was not so much between Bile and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone to Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnasium and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three times world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multiparty event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sports classes across the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie proposed all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" last five "because the next Olympics ship will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality shows that gymnastics are a more expensive sport and gymnasts first and foremost in private trainers, which can be maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastics and families). the list can be continued as desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the majority of these Turnstones are located in wealthy suburbs, which can support business."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to offer the congregations of aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnstice at 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in my events, we have offered free and affordable apartments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness to bloom electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report because of corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attaches the police, observers and councils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and communal government, who is now an anti-corruptionist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated electorate."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have an identification with themselves, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must only name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to add non-removable ink on the finger of a person if they give up their electoral vote in order to prevent somebody selects twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud that comes along with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Election Scale in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court decided that the reigning mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "cynical way", "and that he would have killed his critics with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman should" "lead his campaign on the basis of the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed himself alarming to the fraudulent letter of letters, who made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice in the older members of the Muslim community."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding of ways to prove identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says," "As proof it was raised that pressure was exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose from the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... government institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivities with regard to ethno and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit mailboxes to stop" "election harvests." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters prior to your choice.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they have released their voice to prevent somebody selects twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications to an automatic letterpress.</seg>

<seg id="31">Photography banned in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the elective stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, in order to ensure that employees rule out the rule that voters are alone in the electoral cabin."</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that according to Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the arbitral Tribunal denied Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high demands in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "waste control" of the election registrants of the town hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," "The Court of Judgment in Tower Hamlets of the last year was a warning signal."</seg>
<seg id="39">"as the mother of parliaments, our country carries a proud heritage, but the worrying and concealed distribution of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent his immune system and sausage of a serious test - by lick on some of the most dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk gave his course to a Euro-Schein, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a purging knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaving any object, he used an Luminometer to show himself and show us what he will get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was recorded under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to lick the rinsing knob of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left that he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railings to railway stations to flushing of toilets, the task put its immune system definitively below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, soil, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was confronted with his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample score showed a luminous figure of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminous number of fresh washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused, after its luminous figure was more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This is the worst thing I have done in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorming who ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had made some of the things I instructed him, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent reported that they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a asociale family left their social housing after a delogging with a damage in the amount of £50,000, because it had terrorized its neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, they found shocked employees of the housing association property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were decorated clap holes, wooden planks were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was decorated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be regarded as not as beautiful part of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was comprised of street fights with baseball bats, intimidation, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were stirred up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours told they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogging were cheered by facilitated neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't talk to anybody."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The innumerable times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today tomorrow we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have said the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant administers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is taking into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be horrible for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have been courageous to us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will donate some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of house administration will now have to clean up garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernies and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Skeldon received a fine of money, after having found himself guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in commercial vision."</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says they will delogge tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall shared with that the delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproaches, as well as to those who were harmed by such behaviour," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the state parliament election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"so far, stupid than so far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land pile struggle - this is biting."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the elective warriors, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the land day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are also practical problems: in the holidays helpers who hang on posters, bubbles, distribute air balloons, distribute flyers, and count votes at the end, only laboriously."</seg>
<seg id="9">"up to 4 September 2016, the electoral and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign shortly before the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one sees from its large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, spread roses and chat a little with the people, as it already did his legendary wordkarar predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel guilt on the blooming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create that, "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will now presumably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with her leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited twice Chancellor Angela Merkel to Großkundgenungen; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group didn't vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was probably the majority of other federal states," "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Northeast CDU resumes the usual election campaign on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this is what Kokert believes, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country, it is brittle the base that it must be very strict, to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any place in the sides of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU electoral fought against his co-workers is also self-exposing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is a lot of stake in the game, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just before AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011 the SPD was still clearly winning with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, are likely to make the leap into parliament."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30am in the morning, and only at about 20 o'clock, there is always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>

<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as scheduled for half-time, until the end of October everything should be completed."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the remuneration of those responsible for the construction work is also vowed, for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the block of the asphalt road in Oftersheim is lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation in the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now move from Oftersheim into the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive movement through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomfort," says the deputy head office manager Florian King for the management of the rehabilitation. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bachlerstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking and rather familiar to their Navi than the signposting."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that many lorries in residential areas fail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality sought to reinforce the vehicle of Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant excesses," says King, who made herself aware of the situation on the spot. "</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look at the cards.</seg>

<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for those who have less to do with the" end customer, "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight decrease" "at the car-ership-Maier too, but also admits that" "course of course" "is missing."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the name of the fight against terrorism, it is constantly being screwed to laws."</seg>
<seg id="2">"after the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a dullness to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the connoisseur.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals were politically reasonable by the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not ask anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, further points would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also take part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as Minister of the Interior, however, he was on results and on a" "recoverable consensus" "within the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"according to recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has left a little time to present its conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some is already known, announced, advertised: that a new security authority shall take care of the encryption of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière is starting a second start for proposals not to be made with the SPD: he wants sympathy for terrorist groups to punish and knock jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," said the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that I have no chances at the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in case of appeals for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to face some worse than hitherto - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some are still unbalanced and questions are answered.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient, for example, the question arises: what has this actually to do with certainty and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people were deeply concerned, could not be clamped up in election campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral fights."</seg>
<seg id="35">"therefore, the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking a position on the issue of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, the two parties went on high."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garanty argument about the furnishing of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the bosses also demand a Burka ban and a rejection of the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling for irreconcilable sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a departure from the double pass, he kept nothing."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="23">"after the conversion, the bus stops the customer after the conversion, but I do not speak of a" guarantee, "as announced on Friday in corporate circles."</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason is legal refinement.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the" "Focus" "had reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for re-equipped diesel models."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed last Monday VW ambassadors in the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>

<seg id="28">"VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry committee, and the KBA Complete."</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations from this are not accepted," declared Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion, and all vehicle-approved vehicle values remain unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">"with the wide term" guarantee, "Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers can come back to a workshop for example half a year after retrofitting - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Sheets: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged dear records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hurry to the comment part, to see him under the pseudonym nonstop men's midwife with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the rebirth of sound plates is not on a boom in millenium, who want to greet the news of physical objects, but to be attributed to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on television, I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly stuffy before I stand, hold my hands and tell something certain like:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate-specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men middle aged) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I haven't followed him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to purchase records that he could not afford when they appeared and buying items that he sold when he was young and plagued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were a bit too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who purchase records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers meet the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media lover, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have been emptied by 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar sound sleeves, from objects that wake up happy attitudes."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">That's the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff is blushing out of a stack of plates."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who purchase a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while through a pile of Bossa Nova Commites smoother."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men of middle ages) has noticed a" "trophy" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently here and said," "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio ohead record, so I can put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who come to fruition."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the records nearly a whole floor, has a blower audience than I go into."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagejungs and middle aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer- and sexbepacked pop instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks sonically isolated, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for several minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It tends to be a mannequin than a bustling.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records..."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to pattern the jeans-hot pants, I watch a group of young teenagems grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxuries like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research findings showed that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, have untaken into account the large number of female collectors, which exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bumblebees by plates of the Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator that dominates nothing of the middle aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="1">French Court rejects deal on demolition of stores in the jungle refugee camp</seg>
<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais argues that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also indicated that provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the prefecture of the Calais prefecture is absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide tranquil meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the low-travel was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum items for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest is eight years old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro stage in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji has a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line-up and raw power to win Gold - their first match in the Olympic stadium of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad prize of the Silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it's probably not - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former leader for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here it is lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously and caused the attack to bounce the GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving coaches. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau was running in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he changed."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a guarded Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua had a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new beginning since the reanpfiff and there was still over a minute of playing... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still seeded."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB brought fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favor of the South-Pacific, whose fans sang, agile and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the pfiff sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked crushed in the grass."</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown took the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton sailed the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>

<seg id="10">"the drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, fosters approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="15">"as outstanding events it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of a central computer control system (2004), and the remodelling of water pipes."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">"financial burdens, which the industry threatened from the green electricity subsidy, are from the table."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition from the existing plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said German economic minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers, the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a charter agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG levy is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, this will not be raised in the steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special meaning.</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: sing well seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp throughout her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in doing so, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes hackers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"by means of regular cohesion, seniors can establish and cultivate social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, means hackers."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs regularly even in everyday life are not so fast out of the puff.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the seniors organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority; it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, explaining it."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"by lyrics and especially melodies, self-centred people sing for long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on their own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people who live alone, practice not only to focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir says hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"showing yourself: if I do something for a long time, I will be better and alert over me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you do not sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens when a tone is next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the acquaintance circle in a seniors choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet search."</seg>

<seg id="3">"to their surprise, the chewing also didn't let the males cold - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of arousal of cats at the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="6">Kater also responds to the calls of kittens - but always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"apparently the acoustic differences between the mistrust of less and strongly aroused kittens for the males either are not perceptible or not of importance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH. "</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the specialist magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differs with the urgency of their help."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a herd of babies who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more aroused kittens, which were additionally lifted up."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had not yet own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"they turned out faster to the loudspeaker, when this rustle of the very excited kittens played."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks wear the same signature," said Armed Forces Danai Kritmethavee Fridays early in front of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not stand in connection with the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"instead, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities had kept secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed about the exact date and place."</seg>
<seg id="24">"still, it is not clear which group is behind the attacks."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) paid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to pamper chaos while the country is heading for stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, has made herself good to restore the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not succeed in getting hold of the rebellion of Muslim rebels struggling for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to breeds."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein's painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are distinctive, self-propelled tools, which generate more than 30 million new selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All errors will come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of making the app blackface promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slotty eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics notified a racist caricature of Asians -" "yellow face." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter recalled inviolating clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Savapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote about the photos widely that the filter was" hurting and bark "was uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very gruesome Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not lethal, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the abnormal extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are different from breed different than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats filters an image that is offensive to a user," it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that fast-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the majority of white, only male leaders, and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or good to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely abandoned Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, it refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel responsible, focusing on subrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Zhu, in turn, said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added," "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence-related information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions were allowed on site, reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committee of Defence, Intelligence Committee, and the Military budgetary combatant, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret services, which reported how superior their assessments changed to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"up-to-date information provided by high-level Centcom commanders typically recorded a positive image of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site, and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed descriptions in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct reference to the fact that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superior laws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements in front of the Congress were significantly more positive than facts," stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture Mossuls could start in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress MP from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigations are continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of CentCom reports by the general inspector of the Ministry of Defence is underway."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of redirecting assessments to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," stated the highest level of Democrats in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," delayed the publication of intelligence-related reports, "compensated the morality among analysts and" gave excessively little space for different opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no clues to the White House's intervention in the Centcom analysts with regard to" "certain political opinions". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were accepted after Complaints of Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon Press Officer, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while investigating general inspections were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense greet a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigation proceeds on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion, which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of the last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminiscent of interruptions of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a lettering on how the then government under George W. Bush met only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter finals, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group will reach the first and second place each."</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a back handshake from the near area.</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, it's the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Rio de Janeiro's events feel constant and inescapable, a fast-paced relay race between competition and pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning staff, which is passed by the bristle to the swimmers to the turner for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is a Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a womanband with dimples, could have been quite among those known names that would be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if it were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not immediately illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should modest enough arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline diving has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it became so sparse that many people, I had questioned, did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"despite the fact that the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 has achieved an athlete who made it until the end of the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it is more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an inherited enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never ending bouncing - but also the Grazie of the gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much like" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hedge and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to official Olympic program according to performance, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold, they have to go further, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further undermining goal in televisions: the world or the Olympiaston."</seg>
<seg id="28">"purposeful quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel more tiring when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a Afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to overlook at the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by creating and objectizing male athlete - as the male US Turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expected his air-boiling, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators, who call for political changes in Ethiopia, struggled with the violent resistance of the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shifted the country and expanded into ever more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave that policemen shot and killed outright disarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights agency now requires a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"according to Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight against the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to suppress the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited, with dissidents have been effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile, or to prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following an extensive vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are concerned that separatists, like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, have been forced to exploit the turbulence over the past few years and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of exposure to the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate about internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered in such a way as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amhasa, the two greatest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amhare are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amhas, predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in areas of Amhāna and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amhāras and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is predominately dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had until his death on an unpublicized disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly enshrined in perceiving early signs of discontent and use Special Representatives to process opponents, and to make them harmless."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands were protested against elections, which were apparently mandatory by the government according to analyst statements and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a base for flying over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally collapsing in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin atrocity."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy on Friday saying that his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" Founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans' presidential candidates whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings its comrades who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to declare statements which he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the apologies utterly serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement, remembering that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism threw down on Mr. Trump while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign for falling demand values on economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already provided sarcasm for his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later," "Of course I told the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction expires." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defending the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even tone, because its cargo values continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head racing in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to not excuse himself for his provocative expressions, he frequently accused his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is increasingly focusing on the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps of prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that prior to Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called it hindrangers, completely false and so it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread themselves in order to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"prior to the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being able to travel around him and prejudicated against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, twilight "television experts who try to understand him and said," You cannot!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked at Mr. Trumps apologies as merely another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="4">"the menu on this day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Iegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans how to eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Coes's last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small schnitzky snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter hewed hewed fry, this found the couple for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were Erdnussbrot, Leberkäse and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinste.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have placed itself in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years prior to the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"men of women cooked for masculine rocks and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways that the country turned out to be no longer the Cockaigne."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when the American food was a central, stressed topic," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budgetary diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as bread and casserole have become the staple food, the casserolle as a" wonderful way to reproduce food residues, "Ziegelman noticed that chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Unique mixtures have been tried since a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at noon," Coe says. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann goes on:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the domestic business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - did the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" housekeeper "and the challenge to turn pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "a Square Meal" "is a festival of historical delicacies."</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cake-Eating behaviour."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen of his kitchen, he sailed as the millions of millions of millions of world he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with Gurkensauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and bore a tuxedo.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks get only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Grönlandshark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average straight 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade magazine "Science" in any case from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"mad," says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist assumed a long time, that Grönlandhaie is stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the Grönlandsharie lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time pentine behaves as she recompensated six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the polar sea and look for carcasses, which torso from higher layers of water."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks, the fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeter was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the lens is already created before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, according to the early 1960s, her birth was to lie in the atmosphere of a nuclear weapon search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters, the left nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon dioxide from the nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate his 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in its lenticular nucleus, all larger Grönlandsharks had normal carbon 14 amounts on the other hand, which results in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Grönlandshark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark should be even 392 years old with 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature, and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this might be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusalas live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year old Harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on sparks."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very big animal should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"accordingly, the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the IW. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"in 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton bought an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon & Schuster for their book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim KAINE continue to set standards on financial transparency," gave Clintons campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and trailers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obligated by law."</seg>

<seg id="10">"they are on the train," wrote Clintons's election campaign by Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Thursday Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed."</seg>
<seg id="12">"trumps critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already voiced that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organisations, his business forms and various other connections, especially with Russia."</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already overthrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in the high-ranking Republican Trump to publish his tax declaration.</seg>

<seg id="16">"POLITICO reported that during the 1990s, Trump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s, and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday that this could still be the case."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the election campaign, federal taxes have become a subject."</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett who would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">"during an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate took his seat here, Trump to exchange their tax declarations."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner raged last evening in the male team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow received the anchorage, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy himself. the Junker made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after being in March at the railway world championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a sign up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in which they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolds."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy wins - and Skinner placed an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"behind it was slightly back after his lap, but Kenny held the team forward and Skinner has held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a strategy change made a great part of the transformation, when executing in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we installed an Olympic record and the world champion defeated."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the victory in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that he fell on the track after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such a preventative victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"said," "It feels with all the GB flags on the tribune as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we have so badly taken away with so many titels, that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven of ten titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kennys it is possible in the area of the possibility that he repeatedly wins Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">"this would be for Kenny, who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (apparently holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the case of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny is next to the Sprint, which starts today and will go for three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I enjoy this just for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal contest of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"world record, winning in London Gold in 2012, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had fought with officers before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there were drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and mobbing actors as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom it looks quite like that the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the removal of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the portland of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - stand in the game, as the plant operator terminate the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years is scheduled in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workplaces - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in case of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to dominance effects since the melt mill consumes around 10 percent of the total output of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry enamel, leading the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the many years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melter with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through melt production," shared the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were called" "hedging outlets", "which should come into force from November 2016 onwards."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the income on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL reported that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $187 million in anticipation of cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" Alcoas "ability to operate the melt, or to ensure the power supply to the enamel." "</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before possible closing of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consume around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator, that would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"Estee Lauder, brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), scanned reality video showing the entire Kardashian-denominator family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and ending with a classical twist: they have all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this portrays the clericeezed act almost every birthday episode (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought that we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon on a mustard at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, security has started a new era of the Kardashians."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as regards the Vogue Cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that is rather similar to an image band than a fashion magazine, the output pulls a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the rolling unit 615 pages advertisement)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities who model "as" Models, the celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prizewinner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the former category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">"these celebrities aren't related to famous people, or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true on their denominator)."</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are emerging in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners likes success not everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always something tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her "the mistresses of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the release Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying on the disgrace seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She was sold by her made pictures of Cindy CRAWFORDS daughter to the magazine "LOVE."</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes initially, which would today range for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an office in the West pocket format.</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax it was communicator."</seg>

<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price of 2700 D-Mark was rather proud, that is about 1400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price for a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in August 1996, no one could suspect that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era."</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the phone-saving of Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft."</seg>

<seg id="1">England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring innovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension Heathrows is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">"I was told that England will never be ready for the games, and that we will flash on the world stage."</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-fellers had wrongly in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked by him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 bn on wittingly growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have implemented a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it is time for us to steer this Olympian spirit and expand Heathrow, and thereby secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of."</seg>

<seg id="2">"for companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass Ad Blocking, a" "Katz- und Mausspiel". ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop side, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the encoding regarding his advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" "this kind of hin-and-her battle between the attracting open source community and the converts has been in progress since the invention of advertisers", "and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest company for social media has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide, according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1,03 billion daily active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertisements Facebooks."</seg>

<seg id="11">Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenues so that Facebook will be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its" "ad preference tool" "to give people more control over their commercials."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying new filters, because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising."</seg>
<seg id="14">"for users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," shared a Facebook spokesperson in an email communications. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"ad blockers are a blunt way, why we instead focus on developing tools like Ad Preferences, in order to put more control into the hands of the people."</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours passed on Thursday at a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss, at the age of 49, wanted to kill himself by several vehicles, including a truck."</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on site.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers were already heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police told them, as well as any witnesses of the incident."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Crostetter distributed the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway, it was decided that the drivers don't have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night as it was in the newspaper."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have shown similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably proved to be more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent matter."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus exponates its day-side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought forth a history of Venus, which was similar to evolution, which was suspected of planetary research."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several thousand years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogenres escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa 'Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="7">They turn on the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotational rates, these mature star expels large quantities of starches."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of Express-Malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware specialists malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months, partly several times victims of an attack with blackmailers software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of Ransomware extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the solutions demanded by the perpetrators, in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially explosive ransom is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are observing a scary rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Director Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertisements."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an offering, it searches for recently modified files such as word-, excel or database files as well as after archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmailers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of Bitcoin cryptocurrency."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without making production stoppable."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business operation completely, in a case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, hospitals already have been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of sick acutely."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, who pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know this and try to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the investigators of F-Secure investigated the benefits of the user and the contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware extortion, the hackers become more professional and share the work, declares safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits have been created by buying malware, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, looks and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then are looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals are then pressuring spammers with the spread," "explains Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be withdrawn by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the little HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers in the first row and the rear have plenty of space, it does not seem tight in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably, only the cockpit-top falls slightly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is not only a case of 453 l in case of high-featured and 1026 l with reversed backrests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosessel and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the cargo height with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he is likely to make his work quieter."</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>

<seg id="19">"the security systems belong to the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as" "approaching objects" "when manoeuvring."</seg>
<seg id="21">"very reliable, the beam assistant works."</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent timing belt responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttle the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and an HDMI socket are below the armrest and therefore are somewhat cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"if you don't want to invest so much, the gasoline engine will receive from 20,000 euros, the diesel starting at 23000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one walks around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>

<seg id="8">"currently, many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors in the German Veterinary Association, with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there can be organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common in case of depression," says weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a disk failure, can lie bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worry, there's an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When to sleep with sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, unrested, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, you should contact the primary doctor in case of sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the case of snoring with respiratory sufferers, for example, in case of snoring with respiratory sufferers, in case of disease-fatigue, for sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fibre explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fibre."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera shows the sleeping-ends on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on them?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of stud bolts that can be set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"shooting counts: regular bed- and rise-times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, avoid drinking alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="4">"in front of a Lidl, who will soon be demolished, will be built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article on this trendy district, as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, is preferred in recent weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel pronounced several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go-zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadets, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrol the police with 30 to 40 officials and three crew trucks on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners were the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late late."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, are generally annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to report a majority of police protection against the left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trenches, which the Berlin inner senator and the police make up between house owners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers" district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"house occupations and the new home projects have long been part of the neighborhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">Many of the projects in Riga were legalized while the Mainzer was under great police orders and were still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and elective liners from all over the world over the last few years: local residents from GDR and former home owners share their neighborhood with them."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rent, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the designed discs or newly painted facades that have been thrown with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "left-alone violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem, it could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like physical injury are almost entirely directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the biggest part of the criminal offences make damages, which tend to make the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there is no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not intended."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the famous burning cars, too, will no longer exist in Riga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street does not have a criminal focus on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga-Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important that the residents get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, which all of July suddenly claimed the interpretation of interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which suppress the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end these are condos, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well drunk," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there are frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting them.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented habitats.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Agriculture Office to the municipality and the Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so far as to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings must be made, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be installed on the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, training places, one-Euro-jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be mapped or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Kunde. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as reported by Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers such as sport, contact with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, there is also administration and honorary official."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it just takes and makes it sense to bridge the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two after the recent events fear radicalisation, also in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine client says quite clearly, "" What mancher naiv might call. "" a residual risk could and would not exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"however, the helpers are already sensitive."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"therefore, main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new blow to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly lies the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on site helpers."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the urbach are already familiar with it, to integrate the people so far."</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
