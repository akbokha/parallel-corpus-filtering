Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing sett@@ ling building and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversi@@ al speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress held partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the former election in Israel . &quot;
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
&quot; in a not@@ ebook , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told me that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officers would have to come to his home . &quot;
Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was yet alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was cut to a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had been in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular trial unit , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tici@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call at some point .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting in the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced themselves to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they rejo@@ iced in his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Lamb himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in employment policy of the university signi@@ fied that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as a Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s track when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb sh@@ red@@ ded himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of Ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and a lamb was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar play . &quot;
he was the woman of the woman at that time .
&quot; all girls were mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and live in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , ad@@ joining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced fifteen years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se , which worked online for various companies . &quot;
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5 . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ ke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; &quot; M@@ ahn@@ wache &quot; , &quot; while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set less labour power for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products merchant says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
&quot; while the holidays itself are even months away , the Christmas shop moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ ys over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ning and a mes@@ hing of it away with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; In@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time @-@ travel film ever fil@@ med . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
&quot; UN Chief says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says that its response to Russia is reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief demands again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Meeting to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an ur@@ ged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Query values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand it as a flo@@ p .
others have dism@@ is@@ sed him as a jo@@ ke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of whom did not even win a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive . &quot;
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures consider themselves in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded last week that 60 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish vot@@ ers believe that Real Estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their swe@@ eping hat@@ s , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry were winning the nom@@ ination with just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign as a plau@@ sible look .
&quot; even if the repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still beats every one . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ li@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump harv@@ ests the majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Walker 15 points , ahead Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head racing with Ted Cruz .
the only Candi@@ date that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans say they match Tr@@ ump in the topic of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign calling for two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; ra@@ pe &quot; , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse had become 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump deci@@ ph@@ ous His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage new @-@ orient@@ ated efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register , Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;

&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , meaning the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little . &quot;

Champions League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
doubts Tor@@ ch@@ ütze in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller turned the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ re@@ aus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze announced a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the wit@@ ches @-@ bo@@ ilers of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ aters hits ( 89@@ . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starter race in series is to be the first step towards final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; at his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria , Müller received the best aid of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had passed a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bayern captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 688 promised fans - and the Munich held a word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ outing .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 there was also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously to work with their offensive efforts , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often led to Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k step@@ ped out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner .
in the 67@@ th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown the pil@@ ots of Poland proposed by the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by direct arrest , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee was par@@ ted ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria served its habit@@ ual game , Pi@@ raeus could set a needle @-@ stick . &quot;
but on the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer was a decree .
so about when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the lan@@ te pul@@ ley ( 56@@ . ) .
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ill with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was initially sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero has only given green light after the final training , said sports leader Matthias Sam@@ mer at Sky : &quot; &quot; who wants to make something else out of it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the failed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 76@@ th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ allen . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partially m@@ um@@ med Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with b@@ umps against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least a Bavaria fan was viol@@ ated from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; if you smoke , it does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : when wa@@ sting the risk drops rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ barrel . &quot;
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; tooth decay causes decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , st@@ resses DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ate the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore return to frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ val inflammation in smo@@ kers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of decay . &quot;
&quot; however , people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ards go back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first author Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study director H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads according to our findings also to a good dental health to high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by unemployment , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter lef@@ to@@ vers from the late anti@@ quity on the banks of the Rhine river bank .
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum Skel@@ ette and remains of historical buildings have been excav@@ ated , museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered a specialist for Arch@@ ae@@ ological Monum@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission pro@@ poses new Court in dispute over T@@ TIP
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP .
&quot; the controversi@@ al private lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which is significantly more traditional in its functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said the competent EU commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the Free Trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP will develop the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that EU states and the US have jointly selected independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to be obj@@ ected against jud@@ gments .
&quot; until now , the involved parties agreed with each other to the arbitr@@ ators , a claim to claim against their jud@@ gments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work according to their own data on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could then be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , allowing tax@@ pa@@ yers to cross the tax@@ pa@@ yers , under@@ mine national laws or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act referred to the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot;
it has been cri@@ tici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points considering the reform of the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU Trade Ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could thus be dis@@ advant@@ aged in this way .
&quot; when talks about the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) free trade agreement can be completed , Wednesday continued un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;

deli@@ k@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about various places that he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender@@ ly arranged songs report . &quot;
where they arose and how it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be wonder@@ fully creative . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; they appear wis@@ ely composed songs , which harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fted at any time into the great op@@ ul@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a series of displac@@ ed series : each of the 50 US states should be in consequence . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot;
&quot; here , St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here . &quot;
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nation@@ wide celebrated master@@ piece appears in 2005 . &quot;
super@@ vis@@ hing of ideas and stylis@@ tic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as long as the smaller clubs got out , the stage shows here become the colorful spect@@ acle from Ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ ko . &quot;
&quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany . &quot;
here you will find a selection of HEIN@@ OL and L@@ ON@@ EI@@ H products
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the far more travel@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk music . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent , &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to say more modest , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been anticipated with tension since his election at the premiere of the Prime Minister .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will give his debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister and set up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch while his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p several sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabin and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a comm@@ em@@ oration ceremony celebrating the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several stories stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party initially supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ ack@@ able within Labour &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth leader President David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who promised a different policy approach says that he has given &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the political party of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front , and that it will be subjected to &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ pe with resistance and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented by the shadow economic minister if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
&quot; he also introduced the idea that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kasper@@ le theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s questionna@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; as it was broad@@ cast@@ ed first in 1990 on television , the questionna@@ ire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the under@@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and thanks to widespread reforms . &quot;

po@@ und increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the po@@ und rose @-@ nicely according to data , which indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the building target SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and er@@ ved ass@@ ess@@ ments over the time of an increase in interest rate since 2009 .
&quot; the po@@ und rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a lea@@ p of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.9 % higher . &quot;
ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; the shares of the portfolio and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his valuation for the company rating . &quot;

the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

Peg@@ ida @-@ poster brings the Leban@@ ese to a potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
&quot; it goes both - and in the potato range , which the Olden@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the pro@@ verb &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat has put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Leban@@ ese had the idea to subscribe to the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;

Met@@ cash laun@@ ches ground @-@ level campaign for the fight against al@@ di@@ - di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea
Met@@ Treas@@ ures attempts to protect the I@@ GA outlets from an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ Treas@@ ure has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are diving on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop owners who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian soccer le@@ ague to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be rele@@ asing further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy date . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA store shops make up and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ous provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening up his first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost about 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ z loses market shares in the East states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , IG@@ AS market share has dropped by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction on turnover and mar@@ gins at the same time . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ alers , however , inv@@ ests and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to join Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores through fast @-@ growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s General Manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refur@@ bish@@ ment programs are to be set to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spot@@ light by the not@@ ori@@ ous engagement of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should sm@@ ash the child . &quot;
&quot; as he finally saw how he defeated a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f failed to win a potential US Open Vic@@ tory from Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the solo behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am rather tri@@ umph@@ ant is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi got caught a little in the quar@@ rel , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he broke a ra@@ cket , when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves a lot of appreciation . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too stern . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the changing area , he is well in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important preliminary decision taken on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the controversi@@ es &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick made the climb very quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , and he has made some bad mistakes and deser@@ ves all the cri@@ tiques he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ led the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all of them trying to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants arrested and re@@ acted with rebel@@ lion in a ni@@ em@@ and@@ land .
the people who fled from violence were arrested for an unknown time in a land strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations got up .
&quot; when a police helic@@ opter suspended over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and un@@ locking ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block in a controversi@@ al meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be that the EU states would receive another 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bal@@ er action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stood out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were used to create the sp@@ iny wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are those who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher prison sentences for condemned traff@@ i@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the state of emergency , &quot; said spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cu@@ sto@@ dy and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are helping to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to manipul@@ ate the data of people and squ@@ ee@@ zed a crowd to meet there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pres@@ idential elections ( 58 percent previously ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can vote for the pres@@ idential office , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pres@@ idential elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is holding a great lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support in men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has shi@@ fted , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage with the older vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit edge in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ as@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the Democratic vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less repub@@ li@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it is the candidate , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons Sup@@ por@@ ters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to dealing with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also c@@ ited .
&quot; as the Vice President poses a potential for the pres@@ idency of the Wa@@ ag@@ gregate , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections would like to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic vot@@ ers are asked of the pres@@ idential elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of his second choice .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to candidate for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead to S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bending is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ective &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers in the pres@@ idential election as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristics in vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is best cut off with the three candidates for hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons strength is the leader . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; democratic vot@@ ers generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the vot@@ ers of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers altogether : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the eligible vot@@ ers do not hold them for honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible vot@@ ers see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes on tour . &quot;
&quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located near Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; in the meantime , half of the support of vot@@ ers in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically in the meantime . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also concluded that Car@@ son meets with demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deep@@ est , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the error margin when sampling 376 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in surveys - with 19 % support from the repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ kers for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ umps . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is at present warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing lovers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; many people do not go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea during this week , divi@@ ding the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , assass@@ inations were submitted against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital what contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with blind@@ folded eyes with a 30 po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and suppos@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said polic@@ eman Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , utensi@@ ls began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood princip@@ ally on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said polic@@ eman Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning on his injuries .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ si@@ eve , Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ lic@@ ted with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ gh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; at least one student dies off the chic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third tier for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ed attacks and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also draw them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has b@@ anned the br@@ otherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local community . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest rates are coming , and the house will get into the banks , rent returns for bonds , and the economy will slide into a rec@@ ession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a rec@@ ession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , representatives of the Central Bank have so strongly empha@@ sized that investors should not concentrate when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of an interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a newer study to what happens after the F@@ ed interest increases . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six previous cycles of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published by Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to appear later in the In@@ cre@@ ation cycle and the return will begin to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a rec@@ ession . &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases since 1950 saw only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expected that this will last and anticip@@ ate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; interest ca@@ vi@@ ties in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants went all year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week ending on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the In@@ cre@@ ased Cy@@ cles from 1950 to present in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um at the BI@@ P took place and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights put very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; at bonds , the ren@@ ditions seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the her@@ b@@ arians fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schwa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flat@@ tening of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often result in better y@@ ields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin at Schwa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the earnings curve is f@@ latter , len@@ ding has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and around companies , businesses will take advantage of the greater part of their business operations in the US , benef@@ iting from interest rates and become more attractive for local products . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts will be worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive and the financing of their deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital rati@@ os and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts become a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains due to higher y@@ ields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Con@@ servative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster because of its &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that the private people do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ servative Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; ev@@ oked &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ an@@ eously named examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC General Director dism@@ is@@ sed the alle@@ g@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and giving new works on behalf I also really consider important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , argu@@ ed that harder to work to engage the audience than it was in the past because the British had less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was put under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media at an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there was an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee @-@ makers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed the output in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into host@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there is now evidence that the online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began to buy purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is all , and we will possibly experience that growth decre@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is c@@ ited as a reason for the following turnover . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers keep their purchases from this event , which takes place every last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times saw the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ der websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a British Retail Con@@ sortium study found out that from £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse partly of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the deaths that were killed as a crane to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to z@@ ol@@ len when the first of the dead step@@ ped up their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ aissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the proc@@ ession proc@@ ession went over to the sacred site , where only days before a building crane went through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the bed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi king passed over the construction company of the Bin Laden because of the cat@@ astrophe , which also left 394 injured , a san@@ ction hang@@ ed . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 persons who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , as the crane went down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , would not have said the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State Saudi press agency , said the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the Company may be b@@ anned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man ple@@ aded to reveal what caused the overthrow of the Cran@@ e who rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ min@@ ed the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Q@@ a@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dec@@ eased son , who was kid@@ n@@ apped by the family in 1990 @-@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European tra@@ des@@ men is over
&quot; British employ increasingly arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
&quot; this leads to 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , target@@ ing arti@@ sans . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q points of sale nation@@ wide . &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that British put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European crafts@@ men who carry out the work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or brush to paint walls , nowadays it seems to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; for British employ increasingly arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ market chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which can be addressed to crafts@@ men and to close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are taken by women . &quot;
at the moment the men out@@ wei@@ gh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , showing more female single households that make more renovation than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed companies , has also instruc@@ ted their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that employs exactly 50 percent of the team with women including his management and finance .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ ei@@ ster A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and assignment . &quot;
the def@@ endants did not conf@@ ess themselves guilty .
one of them was also accused of minist@@ erial abuse .
&quot; by this accus@@ ation , he has been acqu@@ itted by force in May . &quot;
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the German At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the accused were able to use funds for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial transactions .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; in order to susp@@ end the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence appe@@ aled that the association was not created at any point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials would have offset only expenses and invested the sports club for which they had invested between 1982 and 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the deb@@ ts - the pas@@ si@@ va bet@@ tered around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we further or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants told one of the def@@ endants in the bread @-@ profession of the financial ministry . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have invested money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the tak@@ eover . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no deb@@ ts may be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial year , the withdrawal of the insur@@ rec@@ tions had been decided in retro@@ sp@@ ect until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expenses was paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; thus , flat and non @-@ detailed bookings also seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and text@@ books managed the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the out@@ flow of the association had not been exposed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial education , it was important to have been the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in the year 2011 against which a function@@ ary investig@@ ator began for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; the accused said , &quot; &quot; The accused said . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ endant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the respon@@ dents knew no answer for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he thought , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , no one would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the accused has been informed , the function@@ ary justi@@ fies . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage to damage . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this wording , because the association had never been damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; said the functional , he never referred to a cent sal@@ ary , he merely comp@@ uted o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ ets , he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expense would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
detailed documentation for the early years could not be presented .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an audi@@ ting , in which everything was judged properly , they explained . &quot;
Mileage money also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all the dwell@@ ings are in cash , so that he had to travel to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his home of the international market , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard continues to work more than 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to personnel mining , which has been ongoing for three years , the computer giant is further disman@@ tled in the division of the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions of the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) computer giant ( HP ) do not find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) will be saved , distributed by the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US Emergency Bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US Emergency Bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates are maintained at the current status of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ under outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to rise to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University left dism@@ iss@@ al
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb sh@@ ou@@ ted a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; issued authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he had shot on someone and someone killed . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of emergency call that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted it to und@@ o it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the notes Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb called relative to a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a PhD in spring 2015 from the Delta State University .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 exec@@ utives around the world will cost the work of the Group . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union . &quot;
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the equity holders Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution to earnings of around 500 million euros a year out of cost and redemption sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a management board for the passenger &apos;s business in the future . &quot;
the Eu@@ row@@ ings budget line should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the management team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines trading under the roof of the Passage Airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign def@@ ender to we@@ eping and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of an el@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , does not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account said , &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; here , Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of PS@@ V . &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom Defender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover by the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving into another direction so that it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better knows ?
&quot; it &apos;s a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost wa@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided by Dr. Se@@ uss , which was published in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph describes in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead of giving a summary of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be suspic@@ ious yet : the text presented by Cameron reads partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax Films , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted will hope to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times after a child in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text was probably come from Camer@@ ons &apos;s elec@@ toral center .
&quot; Super@@ Camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der that has chosen England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een Ali developed with the ball as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ player is oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I have said this - players are their best choices . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he did not bring such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test schl@@ ager receives to set up his character is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a schl@@ ager that I highly restri@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season early in this season when he scor@@ ed 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends of course on the job creation in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat mos@@ ques in addition to cook , which would bring an extra spin bowl and get four Qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a schl@@ ager can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that it is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately made three hundred rounds and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him , he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people possibly see his statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there &apos;s no big number of backup sp@@ inning that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some smart additions to the coaching staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful effort into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ in &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team orders do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light heart@@ ed .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished new negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is It No Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which sever@@ ely dis@@ rup@@ ts Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and recently said that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own gu@@ ilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ es@@ sions and distur@@ bing contractual changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to stay outside the UK within the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and we can see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as with the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long endurance such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a gi@@ fted force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally not plan out helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ al campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a p@@ lei@@ gh &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ y the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone , as they did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all his rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance , Ed Mili@@ band knew who had his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing cu@@ cum@@ bers , telephone h@@ ack@@ ers foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ Indian , who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to dist@@ ract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself as Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had denied the principle of the not adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never with@@ drawn it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly rap@@ es@@ eed on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to forgive me more for me - seems in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ he years to repeat , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC set@@ tee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I just press it out - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blend of blood and the wild gul@@ lies of Tor@@ oni &apos;s Klein @-@ Englis@@ h@@ ism can possibly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and TV this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father sought to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the whir@@ lpool of social media , a brood @-@ place of par@@ ano@@ ia and tre@@ ason . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks certainly that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic am@@ big@@ ui@@ ties to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats are obliged to try to find in all a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have also suspic@@ ious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ es@@ sions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something about the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Fund@@ ament@@ als Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have asked the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &apos; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &apos; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the statements are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to demonstrate their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BAT ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report , said they . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants told the meeting to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but they include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; is not@@ e@@ worthy , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s alle@@ g@@ ations have already been re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes health risks are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die each year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC was to give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former leader of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they will see public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversi@@ al time @-@ windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which were also clearly displayed by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee in his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others don &apos;t do or put in order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a jo@@ ke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I have to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show that what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggest@@ ing that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they &apos;re going on their sacred missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ous programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; for the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are for £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , ur@@ ged that the BBC should check out its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , &quot; &quot; and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public @-@ legal broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada - and they should change this in &quot; &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances will enter into making everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot;
im@@ pulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels which respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical im@@ pulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did so if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bu@@ bb@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the bu@@ bb@@ les , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons have TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ lower and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent from an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily pr@@ one the infected human neur@@ ons for the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; VC@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished about the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms trade - through a lead table of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ epr@@ ints with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen the awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have up@@ set - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others . &quot;
most I &apos;ve learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the retreat in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ picking up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from where you come from and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ jahr , where you are in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you don &apos;t really love Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in the seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a stap@@ le extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show you interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people that you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyelashes were burned in br@@ anding and that fire ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people will attract and maintain their under@@ wear . &quot;
related : don &apos;t remember to start your university with a relationship
intro@@ vert received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ ating culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow soldier is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ pfen : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
join friendship through baking .
&quot; since you start the Uni at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the greeting of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep as@@ leep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken are a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your things is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate , who added their milk a det@@ erg@@ ent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise coming from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb belongs to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them a little bit qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly gave her neigh@@ bors two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour trial . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to enter the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be very embarrass@@ ed if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse to dis@@ connect and then see each day and perhaps experience how to move all common friends to yourself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart passes his own ways - but if a hot mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is fine than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good thrust is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , but never forget someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo . &quot;
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water that you put into the freezer - but don &apos;t kill their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling more than twice .

Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ nas@@ tics has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee stream , we need plenty of living space over the next decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ raced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you teach people in living blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; six months , the construction took place . &quot;
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?

&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities l@@ acks the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
&quot; but , do not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ? &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true it is : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but build luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the nour@@ ishing mother or the poor . &quot;
I show how to get cheap and well @-@ built today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by entering &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the stream@@ lining of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone may switch on half @-@ way and lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

&quot; you should also make sure that before you download our ch@@ eckl@@ ist of all things to prevent things going wrong and protect themselves , if it is tun@@ . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much smar@@ ter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; founded three months ago , Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; has added another member in his ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ elmann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ elmann is the winner of the 1st Class and honor@@ ary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
&quot; the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ elmann with a donation , which accepted the chairman Alfred Klein . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ elmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the city town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is looking for direct contact
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new office at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consult@@ ations , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will receive immediate sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infinite number of questions .
&quot; the new household manager Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the ci@@ vic hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus &quot; are not rarely mentioned , too , because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office offers prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as st@@ amping prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers from the Senior Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; , &quot; Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center shows both business leaders especially in demo@@ graphic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential .
&quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation fes@@ tivities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

&quot; it will be played on Tuesday , October 6 , at the Bamberg Fu@@ ch@@ spar@@ k@@ sta@@ dion . &quot;
&quot; we are glad we now know when the game goes on stage , now we have planning certainty , &quot; &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ hein@@ z Hü@@ mmer , who also points out on the ticket sales . &quot;
it is something special for our team to play against a third @-@ party .
&quot; we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because floo@@ d@@ lights have a special charm . &quot;
&quot; in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht moved Bamberg in 2010 by vic@@ tories at the district li@@ gi@@ sts 1 . FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Region@@ alli@@ gi@@ sten 1 . FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) . &quot;

&quot; one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that one could wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
&quot; on the site of the gas station , there were also three people . &quot;
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted young people and hit the face with the f@@ ist .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over praxis Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and invested 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand lack luck : there Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of Fel@@ sen@@ hausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was a sympathy for the first sight , when the fel@@ lowship had met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently has completed her specialist training in the Golden Hospital and wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had the mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as far as it was , I just inv@@ oked it . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
and so one agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently , he has been active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged in a honor@@ ary position in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness break @-@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a veter@@ in@@ arian . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the renovation the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a consultation room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; as part of a funding program of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the gar@@ bage can receive a supplement of EUR 500@@ 00 . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ pling @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , in the north @-@ German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; if there was no successor , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers consult@@ ations , by the way also continues to look above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the fel@@ low@@ lands . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ are@@ well in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical professionals have practic@@ ed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; after the long time , a little melan@@ chol@@ y desp@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; often &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; your husband adds laugh@@ ing : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I always pressed myself on gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border continue to remain in parallel .
&quot; however , it is clear that everyone who wants to set up a asylum application can &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration currents , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia den@@ oun@@ ces cor@@ ridor - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling in the direction of Austria and Germany , including cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer boundary of the Sch@@ engen area .
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian will not le@@ ak up its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government hur@@ ried , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatia on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to avoid regi@@ stering . &quot;
the Croatian police could interv@@ ene in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , since then , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik perpet@@ u@@ ated police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly around Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country was reck@@ oned with about 4000 refugees , Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Bel@@ grade denied that it is that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border away from Serbia .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it could actually come to a slightly further west distance of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call his details , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a part of this since 2007 , since then the EU partners have achieved a good testimony of what concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ grade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , both Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g border cross@@ ings remain completely closed . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm on Wednesday morning at a local appearance in Hor@@ gos , keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian ri@@ eg@@ es still not cleared mine fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ wers were sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. promised to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next month , 20 c@@ ents less than the previous forecast . &quot;
anal@@ ysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which are at an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and in spite of higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ship@@ ments of heavy and large packages , which are lifted from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless hoped that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces solid y@@ ields , considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the Ri@@ val UPS , who plans to set up 90@@ .000 to 95@@ ,000 additional labour forces , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned a total of 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked anal@@ ysts predic@@ ted . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to CHF 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack asked anal@@ ysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; in recent years Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought revenue in its unit express shipment to st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in freight business . &quot;
&quot; in Pre@@ market Trading , about an hour before the opening , Fed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th . &quot;
&quot; at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen finishes two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story session hall , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be p@@ amper@@ ed by the un@@ preced@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could be fear@@ ful to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal loans , and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Economic Officer at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do to the financial market itself .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been ques@@ tioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predic@@ ted an interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets however expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the str@@ at@@ ins mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average rank by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift up the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would settle the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the pro@@ position expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % among its highest levels , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten global growth . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market has recovered somewhat , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the top of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation , when it is expected to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency department . &quot;
&quot; now , he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency office has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; dissolved tri@@ bul@@ ations around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consul@@ ted with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ier , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to interest rates , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought F@@ ed to reduce its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on the growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t believe that it should be ahead of time . &quot;

more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; even with her 74 lessons , she still loves to teach . &quot;
every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole thing is different than at the right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition is during breast feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should carry out . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system neg@@ atively . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be f@@ latter for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym@@ nas@@ tics building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ platz is progres@@ sing step by step : during the recent meeting of the municipal council , the completed building application was lo@@ wered without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , the Panel had another application for a &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; with non @-@ cor@@ ro@@ sive first and roof over@@ lap should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; we get a wonder@@ fully large south @-@ roof together , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; there was again the inc@@ lin@@ ation that is required for energetic reasons - different from the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; with regard to the inc@@ lin@@ ation - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is usually rather restri@@ ctive when it comes to liber@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nas@@ tics building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at costs .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and latitude transport .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture . &quot;
the facility is located in the quiet surroundings .
the Pei@@ ssen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of the employees draw from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will meet next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the remaining inner station .
the rooms were present .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has caused the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year , and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game , who agreed to take over the leadership from October 1 and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer will be appointed with his team if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , should finally be shut down in Pei@@ ssen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , if the currently ongoing refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chair of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ored that the house , which is owned by the Federal Chanc@@ ellery , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ time maintenance of Car@@ itas and a daily recreation hall . &quot;
&quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where fishermen have been working as chief physician for more than 30 years , have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
&quot; the Hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened once more and again in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required t@@ onight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) in the Berg@@ ischen HC .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns in front of housing g@@ aps
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , a total of 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
this result is a study commissioned by the Con@@ federation of Social Affairs .
&quot; compared to this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an accommodation . &quot;
many then push to the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is pushing a defic@@ it in front of itself , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently in the metrop@@ olitan areas some 7@@ 0,000 residential units already compla@@ ined , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people lived in large cities not@@ with@@ standing in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
&quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; for a longer stay due to the f@@ lau@@ te on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; in the major cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has dropped again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; pro@@ poses a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new inc@@ enti@@ ves should revi@@ ve the social housing construction . &quot;
this could be avoided on the land tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dised flats will be temporarily suspended .
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy program for refugees in the state bank K@@ f@@ W is already good in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , with 184 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no coming through , since more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that the travel through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les will be given .
but nevertheless the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Sch@@ engen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Sch@@ engen country .
&quot; after the era@@ dic@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RTL reported . &quot;
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the day of the day .
&quot; new laws , which occurred in force on the same day , practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
&quot; according to media reports , most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and ta@@ xis into the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not encounter mar@@ ginal f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip holds other dangers : there are still sharp mines out of the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , Hungary is hardly any more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 366 cont@@ ested people .
shortly before the opening on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws steps to overcome and damage the border count as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned prison sentences up to five years and the de@@ port@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; practically , however , no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers shall be depor@@ ted there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
&quot; they gathered the gar@@ bage , the tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side during the past few weeks . &quot;
lock lat@@ tice was disman@@ tled and one of the pick @-@ up bearings in the border place was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reach a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the request of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
Mayor drove &quot; bor@@ dered &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge on Sunday , when there were ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Pas@@ sau by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ ed together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Middle Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have ta@@ sted the un@@ happy guests only once , with snack and drink . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pas@@ sau by car . &quot;
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers went to Wels on Sunday evening in Wels by an ICE to a regional train towards Pas@@ sau , after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany after the short term , but still trying to try the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was put off at the Inn in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday closed , Friday before a two @-@ year run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends many thousands of tens of thousands to us , is a logical outcome of a seem@@ ingly holy policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp right away with the construction of structures to ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor officially opened the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with cha@@ otic states are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; the p@@ oultry must also notice that the &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , there will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for protection seeking . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 35@@ .000 winter@@ proof quartz
Konrad has to deal with the refugee teaching of all hands .
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to provide lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success . &quot;
&quot; even the occup@@ ying of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , Konrad said and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ class . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects about 85@@ .000 Quar@@ ts in the he@@ ur@@ ged year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries with 15@@ ,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the coun@@ cill@@ ors he has already conducted talks .
they had promised him to create lod@@ g@@ ings for the coming refugees too .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar was supported by Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born and will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to comply with a certain height of the tow@@ el holder or the size of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was successful with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any cost as they themselves stated .
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
&quot; so far , our own district search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz is calling for a better division
&quot; first of all , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for Refu@@ ge@@ es is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because the suffer@@ ers can currently under@@ go without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suitability . &quot;
criticism of the City Council on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone line with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) is responsible for further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the prot@@ ectors would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meter ) , is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology segment . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Dut@@ ch@@ man promises some promise : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2700 square meters of rest in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are in@@ quiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags stand in the centre . &quot;
&quot; actually , Jutta Brei@@ t wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade , and finally got a new business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which they sell , among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , all around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been re@@ constructed . &quot;
&quot; but I have taken a long time to see if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Brei@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor for the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own place where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Gre@@ ater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot;
their fashion interest has given Brei@@ t from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman can not answer with the last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is upgra@@ ded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called its inhabitants .
&quot; this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he appe@@ als to foreign hos@@ tility , journalists are sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ised or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. pres@@ idential office is stir@@ red up the campaign . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire origin@@ ate . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
many in the 1200 @-@ resident @-@ place is related over -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters Art , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , to which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit &apos; a big mau@@ l &apos; , Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high German : the sponsor , says . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the sponsor .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were the first real estate acquis@@ itions in New York .
&quot; however , the life of grand@@ parents was not free of trage@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Ga@@ el@@ ic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film launch . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more dist@@ anced from the American , &quot; he is always so br@@ anded . &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm mentioned like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz ended during a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine this by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he did not win the election , for &quot; he has such radical beliefs , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ y@@ ings at the time of his grand@@ father in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ pres@@ idents of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shi@@ fts in the reviews for Today . &quot;
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the u@@ prising seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since the sunrise gave an average of 39@@ 7@@ .000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , compared with Today 3@@ 39@@ .000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today the gap to Sunrise has closed in recent months .
&quot; in August Today , today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 330@@ ,000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap was between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September , sunrise at an average of 3@@ 49@@ .000 spectators stands at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
critics have wonder@@ ed whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ .000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e resulted in an average of 4@@ 46@@ 0,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang up to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ .000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour of 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that couldn &apos;t manage to over@@ head the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three voices handed over : bach@@ el@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may appear un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood ends in The Bachelor , was finally wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not show if she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may have mistakenly deleted an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood has sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have settled in ly@@ ric fashion about why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive Woo@@ ds last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ visit last week she made clear that Wood &apos;s &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not her , she was terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between Sne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some train@@ ers have b@@ anned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank as he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t during his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his twi@@ sted catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
j@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compar@@ es the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Goal area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agram .
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of homosexu@@ als

the Free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees .
&quot; party and party leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ fall arrest in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get uph@@ e@@ av@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
open vot@@ ers are held on Friday to Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the Klau@@ sur , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protected zones for refugees in Syria as it existed during the war in the 1990s .
&quot; so it is not going on , we must face the causes , &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courses that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW leader cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need nation@@ wide uniform standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria post@@ pon@@ es , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more viable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national politics in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ term burner remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Kult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; which has been tested for three years with an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years . &quot;
&quot; however , Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough . &quot;
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW leader . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all Gym@@ na@@ sia that want this .
free drive from G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to jump on the j@@ umps
the German stock market has closed up with winn@@ ings after a long distances of land@@ less and nervous circulation .
&quot; only in the afternoon , a fir@@ mer op@@ ener of the US ex@@ changes ensured a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points . &quot;
the medium @-@ sized MD@@ ax gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the techn@@ ologi@@ zed Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.0@@ 3 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
&quot; Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 as the Eurozone &apos;s leading index fell by 1,@@ 01 percent to 320@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also booked trade places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the D@@ ow Jones index not@@ ated about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
&quot; in this way , many stock markets expect the markets to come into place until after the interest in the US and also to the big di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea at the trade fairs on this Friday . &quot;
&quot; the discussion about the burden of nuclear expansion has pushed the shares of RW@@ E for a record in the meantime , and also left deep marks at E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies are missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3,@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6,@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.9 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; according to a re@@ ta@@ iler , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took place from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; therefore , investors gave little attention to the German chip maker . &quot;
the investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus should be paid to the automotive market .

4 People killed after police officers shoot on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police fired rubber sho@@ ots to a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u capital . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district officials , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them thre@@ w stones and fire bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then pushed into the air before returning to rubber sho@@ ots .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber sho@@ ots , known to them that they can kill but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high mort@@ ality rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ ati@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al issue in Nepal , which has been ruled centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislat@@ ors accelerated the trial after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislat@@ ors have voted this week over certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

project H@@ ieve : details are on the table

&quot; for months , behind closed doors were negoti@@ ated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
&quot; now , the plans for a new holiday resort on the Small Sea are near Em@@ den on the table . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ spective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ ile company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ der Council City Development Committee . &quot;

&quot; under the pressure of the project cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP Group , which submitted to the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has been running around ten to twelve million euros for months in the discussion .
&quot; violent reactions among the land@@ lords who had come into the meeting , marked the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and member of the board at the interests of the tra@@ ilers , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears such a number of other project critics that the traffic would grow strongly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; there must be full bus dischar@@ ges so that this is reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are of the former inn , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we must have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google laun@@ ches dup@@ lication donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help 11 million of humanitarian organizations , to help thousands of refugees who over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who was fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are searching for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / gra@@ ft , doubled to $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or o@@ besity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , o@@ besity surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are o@@ bes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which have been collected in a study since 2007 , compar@@ es two types of o@@ besity surgery - stomach @-@ b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease can be completely dissolved and 28 % partial . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes completely dissolved in one percent and in part with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood level , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also toler@@ ated average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was with o@@ bes@@ e people who under@@ went a o@@ besity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with o@@ besity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is being noted in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth for years , and he falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa B@@ inder .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe could not take all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader called on to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries was ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terror attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of dis@@ infection of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centers in the USA report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ lows strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reporting po@@ ison control centers , rose from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more frequent to these products , and s@@ adly a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube as te@@ ens dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only drink due to a cheap experience .
young people have suppos@@ edly mixed inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be caught by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ zer ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially for small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in Can@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer in reach of children , and when children come from it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally dr@@ unken with an adult , said Dr. Chris RIT@@ CHE@@ Y , a emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ wo@@ ke her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , said RIT@@ CHE@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ aries and to store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ont@@ ario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York decided to po@@ ison their &quot; &quot; gem@@ s &quot; &quot; teacher by expla@@ ining anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their space .
&quot; the police looked at the failed plan as &quot; &quot; Ges@@ hur@@ tz &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the rise of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , such as the figures of the National Statistics offices ( ONS ) . &quot;

&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than spots , a mac@@ ab@@ aster lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be chosen , he will see it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I cannot do that .
&quot; in addition to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined with her .
&quot; she dre@@ amt that she could have &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to whom you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke to the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to go back to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a home @-@ peac@@ eke@@ eping incident in Becken@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and ho@@ l me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ cent@@ c was not very enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt sound sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; look like to high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything suddenly comes out , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes one re@@ acts and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home t@@ onight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go around raised head , and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m doing my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
Moo@@ dy had previously had the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y his barn .
&quot; eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to grasp . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of his time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the opinion that it will be personally ?
&quot; does the RV@@ L be@@ have co@@ war@@ dly , and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ str@@ ations of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he &quot; &quot; could throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ loaded Master Black Caviar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse deb@@ ts , which met the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday that was so .
but it was also like that on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who impose these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man was arrested by driver cur@@ sed
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and a driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Setting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told the arbitr@@ ators to have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team scor@@ ed the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the t@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that they were only focused on tac@@ kling their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers at his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring events when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our defen@@ sive system or techniques all year . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and that has provided for us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not ac@@ custom@@ ed to lose , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it is already funny how this time and again this time of the year emerg@@ es .
&quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne says of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting it was &quot; , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a failure . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ sters scor@@ ed a higher result than the Bron@@ cos play against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ auses making and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the maps .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team is free on this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday night at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start tomorrow . &quot;

&quot; a man who is probably threatened with a life @-@ long penalty because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led to Que@@ ens@@ land , was fre@@ ed against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America over Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ threatening punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café there could have been a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the criminal case he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ ida@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against the security deposit , under the conditions that he resign@@ s his Australian and Serbian passport , with the police daily and sat at an initial bul@@ lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
an accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
a truck driver had sever@@ ely injured a truck driver with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried . &quot;
the cab of the accident caused by accident broke out completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed completely over six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to attract ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this fell as@@ leep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; searching &quot; &quot; web research that used terms for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ ten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be ad@@ dic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten p@@ ests . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of ra@@ pe and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mb@@ ling and we@@ eping .
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the Indi@@ ct@@ ment to have in@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 last year , to have viol@@ ated this year against the editions and did not appear before court appearance on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; may be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael wa@@ its the verdi@@ ct until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in cu@@ sto@@ dy due to hear@@ ings to other remaining cases . &quot;
he was still recorded before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up away from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the hau@@ lers suffered from fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man from the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river Inn , Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been picked up more than 1000 refugees in the districts of Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they had come to the German side by foot on bridges and shr@@ ub@@ s .
there they are taken from federal police and forwar@@ ded to registration .
&quot; at Munich &apos;s main railway station , there were more refugees more refugees on Wednesday compared to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the city was reached on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : out@@ er@@ un@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest , &quot;

&quot; the vigor@@ ous Deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the past days . &quot;
fier@@ ce stor@@ ms and thunder@@ stor@@ ms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , Thurs@@ day@@ morning it is also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see@@ reis with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hours of hour . &quot;
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ he@@ aters show their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
&quot; in 2015 , above all , the compact cars are to be recorded , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell to this segment alone in August .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( audience stage 17th to 27th September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German motor@@ sport sector is Opel Astra , who will stand at dealers in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive for this . &quot;
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 990 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse supplies further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are also among them . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variation will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a empha@@ sized sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in trade , he comes next year , then also as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan dealer wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , adap@@ ts itself fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is by manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
the start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not brand new but completely renewed is the comp@@ actor model DS 4 , which is visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers above all laid hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was drawn new , and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was mainly moderni@@ zed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the upgra@@ ded Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted a former prison@@ er of the judicial exec@@ utor of Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; due to the injury of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation , when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
&quot; those affected can even hope to judge the judges , even if they were confin@@ ed to confin@@ ed spaces within a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus , a former prison@@ er with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who is now on free foot after his lawyer &apos;s information was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warran@@ t for the illegal det@@ ention conditions against the land of Berlin failed .
but the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht will now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of arrest for compensation are decisive , there was a compensation , it was called . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clear the amount of money .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of interest . &quot;
&quot; so they spoke only in April of a prison@@ er of damage , because he was locked naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to 2011 , the multi @-@ occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday that a prison@@ er had agreed to a decent housing in November 2009 . &quot;
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated every day between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to pun@@ ches it should have come about due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany after forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that .
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in affordable rental objects : between 600@@ 00 and 800@@ 00 social housing from the rental price binding , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social flats annually need to be created every year , and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion euros per year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of State agree that there must be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the p@@ oultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically after their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the company society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from labour ban for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to restri@@ ct asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the short@@ age of skilled labour , there is a majority of the view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is therefore the Königs@@ weg path to the integration of the Königs@@ weg . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ pieces in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the capacity of training - roughly by allowing more trade schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for classes without knowledge of German . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by educated teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ age of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or patient studies - the only exception has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
studying willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a residence or debt do not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the legitimate people . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this Span@@ ne shor@@ tens up to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap also needs to be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get immediately B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually depri@@ ve Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church law to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which professionally takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights are also duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him some control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the read@@ iness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism , too . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is ur@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - for a decade , an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long for a long time , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention must become reality in the coming years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all of them to the registration of health cards . &quot;
&quot; later , services could be settled later with the federal states . &quot;
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited service catalogue which the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law fores@@ aw . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors prefer to create the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health schol@@ ar The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be more aware of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters would have to be accepted . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have been helped with more general rehabilitation centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; under refugee children , there is much more un@@ treated disability , and with the young people it is about HIV enligh@@ tenment . &quot;
&quot; with some other illnesses , German doctors would come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; a paras@@ ite case or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as regards the doctor &apos;s angel , it may even be reli@@ eved by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , and several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and possibly need to check out tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is mentally ill following estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; in particular , refugee children are vulnerable , declar@@ es Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study at the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee boy is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death an@@ xi@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe ti@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , however , the treatment usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst rel@@ ies on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst is inviting in the arena of bricks to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Animal Teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the actual stage of affairs .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift of ma@@ stered the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take away people from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tail with world @-@ city fla@@ ir , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this fla@@ ir .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
the Cub@@ an duo will take up the Cub@@ an duo with the heroes of the silent movies .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is supposed to con@@ quer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ul@@ ties . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ icy@@ cle on a ball ?
for He Yuan is not a problem .
sli@@ mm@@ ing people fascin@@ ate and are frigh@@ tened at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it is not good for us . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by the eyes of every desire . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
the highest commandment is : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
&quot; from 17 to 20 September , the Circus Pro@@ bst hosts his performances daily from 17 to 20 September . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are discounted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the zoo is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening was also approved by alle@@ g@@ ations of the opposition of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe from Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had stopped him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politi@@ cian SMS messages have received SMS messages on their phones , which they warned against interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the affected parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 work@@ places within the scope of restructuring and savings in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will share two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected foot@@ print will result in a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who will lead the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenues and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ sufficient , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to handle the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely foc@@ uss@@ ed companies deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the play against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere certainly won at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain . &quot;
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical perspective , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd shows 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five playing times .
the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deser@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need to get a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to go on by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured in the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven away from the distant hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al has never worked .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now has become more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how su@@ icide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there is three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Aga@@ inst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced ( CAL@@ M - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of asking the culture to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms noted that if the suffer@@ er had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere &quot; , his chances of recovery are doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication held by social media , focusing on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , mer@@ ry and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the sense of hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in cozy sessions and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often with@@ hold back to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of phone past@@ oral care , I explained : ... &quot; my hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endanger@@ ed , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might also help people in eye view of desp@@ air also , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop of the day totally re@@ designed setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ festival
di Maria meets to help PSG to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PSG player , who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scor@@ ed a head @-@ ball@@ tor at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they are not only aiming at the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . later he was replaced by his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to create problems and relax , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was thrown out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was designated as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and passed nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who suggested Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field was a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PSG himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ p@@ ses and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned the Di Maria into a shooting , which was lo@@ wered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2. minute at the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth season of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the end result very low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi arrived at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG has played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification plays are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ by share sales
&quot; mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ enc@@ ore located in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its huge debt til@@ ting plan . &quot;
&quot; the Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ in order to pay off its own debt . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , is strug@@ gling with falling raw material prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses the demand and has been disa@@ stro@@ us in markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of reference rights brought a rapid rise to the London Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share increased by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore last week announced the 2.5 billion share of stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to exter@@ min@@ ate around one third of its $ 30 billion deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the U.S. president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yu@@ an at a state @-@ d@@ iner after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .
&quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before going on to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and X@@ i have a number of controversi@@ al issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversi@@ al waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times Champions League winner , two times Club champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old , after 24 years , left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was already standing in front of Barcelona in front of the f@@ are@@ well . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we do nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on is playing diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she won &apos;t need behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out when this under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor von The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the F@@ ARRE@@ FL@@ Y brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown initially said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te beaten by her white te@@ at . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the movie ; Dam@@ on rep@@ lied that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when accurate ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ age of Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the motion Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nation@@ wide effect and ur@@ ged legislat@@ ors and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured co@@ hes@@ ion . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; recently , leader of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter has published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
&quot; professional sport cli@@ m@@ ber and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the contest show , which just completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time , with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero concluded this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the fier@@ ce victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his b@@ unch of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Britain , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and change life , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he gets a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had di@@ pped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warrior was extended for a wet season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass through Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins wa@@ sted a chance to climb inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scores three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two ranks , his first r@@ ents since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has a well curved head@@ board , &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better off in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inner , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ schl@@ ager Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run tear from the right @-@ handed revol@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the end @-@ run in the second Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was that in the Major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a insurance run at the end of the ninth inner , the wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ Don and scor@@ ed the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for its fifth . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited the game from a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three rounds in the first two inner ring against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hi gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right hand , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not very well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scor@@ ed no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a breach of the limbs .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to fight against the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
&quot; since the 20th of August , he has been missing in the right hip since the 20th of August . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers and the Tw@@ ins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in them should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden hur@@ ried on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event last days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily supp@@ ress there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse for the first recording of the government pres@@ idency of the government . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have established emergency accommodations in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he proposed the European states &quot; collective elim@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military participation in Germany has passed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing on our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German amb@@ assador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Federal Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back . &quot;
Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call her and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kans route . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; so far , the EU countries cannot agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start on Tuesday ( 22 September ) on a special meeting for the binding distribution of additional 120,000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Bund will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , compla@@ in to them too . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ eye view could not stay in Germany too .
this view had been sum@@ mar@@ ised in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge force effort . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees have now stuck on the Bal@@ kans .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats depar@@ ting across Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan promp@@ tly .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had gone through the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands more migrants on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the icing of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ app@@ ies a global ocean . &quot;
this includes researchers from observ@@ ations of the space son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its track around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this de@@ af movement is only small but nevertheless too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Cor@@ nell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for a longer time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , feed the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München needs to ab@@ stain about one month on the offensive Val@@ det R@@ ama .
&quot; a study carried out an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , shared the association . &quot;
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this makes us difficult , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a united professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a de@@ press@@ ant . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .

tor@@ ch Ruby Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training once a week after his bra@@ ins .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National player should go into running training . &quot;
&quot; at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a violent clas@@ h . &quot;
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious sur@@ geon . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gan@@ ese contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gan@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gan@@ os contain relatively much sugar - above all su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. The man@@ gan@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gan@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and smell . &quot;
the shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gan@@ ese can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .

&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been recur@@ ring since last year to be ready for the Christmas business . &quot;

&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ illes &apos; side of the F@@ öh@@ n , it breaks through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blow@@ s with storm strength through the com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; after Com@@ promis@@ ers on Thursday morning , we cross a marked cold @-@ front , which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind ar@@ ches and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west flow . &quot;
&quot; on the mountain@@ side side , the night is breaking through the valleys through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of the fo@@ eh@@ n until Thursday morning in the valleys with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair dryer can penet@@ rate up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and in the mountains there are even or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , humidity begins to st@@ ow away on the mountain slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain sets a rain that lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this is due to large amounts of ra@@ inf@@ all over the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n goes out of the air , in a row a cold @-@ front with powerful , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front the wind will refres@@ h strong up to stor@@ my , and the temperatures rise significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , but in the south it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of town President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a hi@@ ther@@ less place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now honored as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested from the work community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries only in secret . &quot;
with the square I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a sin@@ cere sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions might have strengthened him by histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the disc@@ la@@ imer .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , this may seem quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; Book of All Books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that focus on themes such as dead@@ lines , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he spont@@ an@@ eously fascin@@ ates several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on artificial books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and so into today , translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original text of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order . &quot;
&quot; then the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls . &quot;
I tried to work on to help me again with the Lord &apos;s Father .
&quot; his second concern is to bring art back to more importance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is now shaped by advertising , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the spect@@ ator go into the pictures , &quot; discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture seeks his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I have not paid attention to comprehen@@ ding the Bible , but the most important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn se@@ am
&quot; plans taken place , company commissioned to model earth hill for a circuit : a year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ures in politics and administration were responsible for dr@@ y@@ ness , especially in the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so hill depor@@ ted , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the First Municipal Auth@@ or@@ ator Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck can now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; then there should be no &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga starts a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in addressing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the German Chancellor and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must put the policy .
the German Football League therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal lists support this program .
&quot; already at this weekend , the 36 profil@@ ers set a clear sign when they are on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can only &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ Sport@@ chef Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ intel@@ li@@ gi@@ bility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody must go away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football , no , we have to use our jet force , our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the le@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; for the European Championship against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 lic@@ ences had started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this year and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP Chief of Management loses an eye in accident
&quot; the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a crash at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he was on a water glass after midnight , which he wore in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood @-@ bloo@@ ded , was impot@@ ent , then drag@@ ged out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , and will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software companies . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; SZ &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to get up again , if you like it . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ t ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen was twe@@ aking a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as a reserve for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Weiden@@ F@@ eller in the Gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ ell with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high intensity of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his tri@@ bal position on the re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the gate position .
this is why Roman Weiden@@ er adop@@ ts the place of Stamm@@ man Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether Wil@@ low W@@ eller will be deployed in all Europe League games in the future , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also deny the second game . &quot;
&quot; the final statement by fellow player Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps middle @-@ field players Julian Wei@@ gl as understand@@ able : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to take the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast moving to digital radio . &quot;
the testing of new technology is currently on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to avoid the driver &quot; no additional risks of liability , &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework &quot; and , &quot; where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to make use of the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees man as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location value the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD transport policy S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA by For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Insp@@ ection Reg@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are going through in the coming ten years , 32 percent expect that 31 percent do not believe at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 2025 were reck@@ oned with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 per cent in flowing traffic could imagine on the highway , in traffic 45 per cent . &quot;
good every member would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current stand at the title battle of September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf will only be able to beat in the single . &quot;
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship event in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is born on Friday Z@@ UR@@ Ü@@ CK@@ ER@@ WAR@@ TE@@ T .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; said single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , was also remin@@ is@@ cent of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; by this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ ranking five @-@ five . &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w von Manchester United has taken a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Eind@@ ho@@ ven , the Defender has been hit by a Tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits the big star of the fashion scene - and that he was stuck in skir@@ ts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the f@@ ant of the Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation on September 18 , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his first rej@@ ection@@ ist attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
&quot; previously , the impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , who has written fashion history , without ever having completed an appren@@ tic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was done : to fres@@ hen up the d@@ olls , for example , a st@@ yl@@ ist is engaged . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , agile , trendy design of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , including Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
&quot; later I bought it , of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gard@@ iner - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example to cover ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ desp@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; instead , the mode is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning times of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace , fashion played a larger role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and now is re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stylis@@ tic periods , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
&quot; if you do not use any niche in the textile industry in Germany , it is no longer on the market . &quot;
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were broken off . &quot;
private specialty shops and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , current to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ bead in Fal@@ ken@@ stein explains : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; Professor U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outside office of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Saxony , at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies , who have to think of everything economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only slightly varies to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine handles small kit@@ chens at some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; she also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and would like to have a souven@@ ir . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern amb@@ assador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; you should not touch le@@ gends , but Disney is still dar@@ ing for a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a new movie , but a continuation of the 20 years after the first film with the magic children girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; but the director says : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woo@@ ds &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy must open wide out@@ ward to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group entrusted with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should be committed to attra@@ cting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategy for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and drive forward reforms will bring about new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system will gradually be tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as the market has a major role in the allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a right @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies will decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors to open , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and deliver better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee lawyers &apos; right to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury border value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus exploit the consumers a significantly higher dose of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding work paper of the EU , has critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of fail@@ ing industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full force to pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ er should be lifted for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy grounds &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily loaded with mer@@ cury , that at the basis of the current limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be un@@ pol@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller tom@@ bs , such as car@@ p , are usually so low bur@@ dened , that they hold the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant di@@ stra@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans which strongly accum@@ ulates over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts of particularly in inf@@ ants can cause damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations hit the Gre@@ ens Bundestag Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount recorded in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nation@@ wide exceeded , &quot; had c@@ ited the &quot; Spiegel &quot; from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
