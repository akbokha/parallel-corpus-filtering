Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting there is also the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington cri@@ tici@@ zes Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement building and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal struck by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has further deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversi@@ al speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress that was partly judged as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of the election in Israel . &quot;
in a emergency call Professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb re@@ counted with a somewhat irrit@@ ated voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officers would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who had already travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular historical processor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tici@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency call at some point .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting in the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they rejo@@ iced in his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal background . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies towards proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the recent changes in employment policy of the university meant that the doc@@ torate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found a lane when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his par@@ ental house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb opened his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he obtained a doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long lasting friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar play . &quot;
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; all girls were mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally devast@@ ated , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues played . &quot;
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se , who worked online for various companies . &quot;
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5 for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ ke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , managed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American Native Americans and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , an English @-@ professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial vi@@ gi@@ l , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors Emil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb sh@@ ook the emergency phone after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it plans to employ 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and sales centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 more than 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays itself are months away , the Christmas shop moves closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox exc@@ uses his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also notable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ning and a distance from it to be with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;

UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon , Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says that his response to Russia is reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the edge of the minist@@ erial session of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Po@@ wers &quot; make this situation irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an ur@@ ged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Query values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flo@@ p .
others have dism@@ is@@ sed him as a jo@@ ke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it did not work ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of Nom@@ ination of Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to pl@@ unge it .
here are some recent surveys that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of ten repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ ers GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two of them say they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he was the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish vot@@ ers believe that Real Estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , says ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
&quot; if they expose their swe@@ eping @-@ hat@@ s , Republi@@ can vot@@ ers Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change from the date when four out of ten end of July put their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry was winning the nom@@ ination of just 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet it is clear that a large number of GO@@ P vot@@ ers look at Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost everybody . &quot;
some experts suggest that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps management while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ li@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump harv@@ ested majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ dir and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only Candi@@ date that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign led to immigrants from Mexico two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse had been in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump deci@@ de@@ dly His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and destroy the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday , six of ten repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration in the spot@@ light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa repub@@ lic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated about the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish@@ ly anno@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
here in the Hob@@ bit Trail is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea coast .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; meaning the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers cost a square meter most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers real estate service provider has published a ranking of the most exclusive German homes - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ indicated . &quot;
&quot; well , who can afford it ... &quot;
&quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top right here . &quot;
Champions League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double goal in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller left the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympia &apos;s Pir@@ äus - then ran it .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; Wit@@ ch essel &quot; &quot; of Pir@@ äus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ i hits ( 89@@ . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth WSOP success in series should be the first step towards fin@@ als on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt at last . &quot;
&quot; at his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria lead , Müller was awarded the best aid of Olympic team by Olympic team Roberto , who had passed a nick@@ named shot of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; had promised Bayern captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 688 promising fans - and the Münchner kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ outing .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the King class , among them against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but with their aggressive efforts often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often led to the left outside Douglas Costa , which was rarely used against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
mil@@ ler had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k insert from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner .
in the 67@@ th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; at first , when Olympic @-@ St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee had par@@ sed ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians moved up their habit@@ ual game , Pi@@ raeus could bet needle @-@ stal@@ ks . &quot;
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neuer was a se@@ duction .
so about when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te dist@@ rac@@ ts ( 56@@ th ) .
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola left a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was initially sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero only gave green light after the final session , said sports president Matthias Sam@@ mer at Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an to the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 76@@ th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , and by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly framed Bavarian fans in their audience block apparently had prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least a Bavaria @-@ Fan was wounded from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; if you smoke , it does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : when wa@@ sting the risk decre@@ ases fast .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers were at risk of losing their teeth matur@@ ely in order to improve the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ degree . &quot;
&quot; the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; major causes of tooth failure are ca@@ vi@@ ties and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ating the authors . &quot;
the link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of ca@@ vi@@ ties .
&quot; however , people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard decre@@ ases to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study director H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also results in good dental health to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by non @-@ unemployment , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter lef@@ to@@ vers from late anti@@ quity to Cologne Rhein@@ ufer
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum Skel@@ eton and remains of historic buildings have excav@@ ated , museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday . &quot;
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always extended as a specialist for arch@@ eological monuments . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had been a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; along with the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission pro@@ poses new tri@@ bunal in dispute over T@@ TIP
the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the resolution of the agreement on the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement of T@@ TIP .
&quot; the controversi@@ al private lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in its functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared S &amp; D Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the US free trade talks .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP will create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely see that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they are to come from the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against verdi@@ cts .
&quot; until now , the proced@@ ural parties agreed with each other at arbitr@@ ators , there was no obj@@ ection to their jud@@ gments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens were not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work on an International Investment Court in accordance with its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
&quot; the Investor @-@ State Disp@@ ute Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , allowing tax@@ pa@@ yers to leg@@ alize the tax@@ pa@@ yers , under@@ mine national laws or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP , such as Camp@@ act , described the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot;
it has been cri@@ tici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major advance . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points for the reform of the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association of Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the activities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when talks on the T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) free trade agreement can be completed , Wednesday continued un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year . &quot;

deli@@ co@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy folk singers recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about different places he repeatedly draws on the map , about what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender@@ ly arranged songs report . &quot;
where they arose and how it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonder@@ fully creative mind . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; they appear wis@@ ely composed songs that harmon@@ ise very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great op@@ ul@@ ents at all times . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a series of displac@@ ed series : each of the 50 States federal states should follow . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine @-@ proximity , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot;
&quot; here , St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here . &quot;
live are enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; with &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a master@@ piece is celebrated in 2005 . &quot;
super@@ bly based on ideas and stylis@@ tic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic selling pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth ordinary studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here become a colorful spect@@ acle from ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
&quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band in Germany . &quot;
here you will find a selection of HEIN@@ OL and L@@ ON@@ EI@@ H products
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; commerci@@ ally available theatre since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now ban@@ ished in their chairs , the clearly rei@@ sever@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens returns to the in@@ tim@@ acy and to the folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one h@@ ears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent , &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; plate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; just for an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , playing acousti@@ cally very few older songs and finally bows off under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister with tension since his election
the new leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six given questions shortly after mid@@ day and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour M@@ EPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p several sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the cabinet cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , during a comm@@ em@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several cover stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ cab , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two Night program , he advised the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they called themselves on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party initially supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bur@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ ack@@ able &quot; &quot; within Labour as well as to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements to the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour made amend@@ ments to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith said the Shadow Assistant and R@@ ant minister that the party was &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth leader President David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the leader who promised a different policy set says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the issue of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from &quot; striking &quot; and stri@@ ving with resistance , instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented by the shadow of economic affairs minister if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
&quot; he also introduced the idea that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ Theater . &quot; but a few years later he admitted he failed . &quot;
&quot; as it was broad@@ cast@@ ed first in the year 1990 on television , the questionna@@ ire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his colleagues , although critics have argu@@ ed that she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and thanks far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

po@@ und increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the po@@ und rose @-@ nicely after data , which show a rise in the UK wage growth . in addition , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s target target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage was the fastest and succ@@ es@@ ful estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the po@@ und rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a lea@@ p of 20 % after taking over offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ B@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;

ri@@ chem@@ y &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the mon@@ di packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment of the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
JD Sports climb@@ ed 3.1 % after the sport management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could make the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less extra jobs . &quot;

cash laun@@ ches ground @-@ level campaign to combat aging
cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA outlets from an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ z has launched a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ z and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian So@@ ccer League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash publis@@ hes additional details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investors strategy date . &quot;
it is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut away about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that the I@@ GA retail dealer could lose 360 $ millions of revenue per year and USD 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business , and in the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of high fixed cost base , could cost about 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ z loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ z refused to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction at the same time on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ests and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compens@@ ate for sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refur@@ bish@@ ments are to be set at El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves praise for the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spot@@ light by the not@@ ori@@ ous confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f ten@@ ded a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am quite cour@@ age@@ ous is the fact that in my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the quar@@ rel , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he broke a ra@@ cket as he lost a fight in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has acted extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I believe he was treated a little too stern . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well respected , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also did not take into account the decision to take Kyr@@ gi@@ os with the important preliminary decision taken on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick made very quick progress on what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deser@@ ves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the r@@ amp in which he can only think about it , I think appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declar@@ es emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all of them trying to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants arrested and acted with rebel@@ lion in a ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land .
the people who fled from violence were arrested for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter hung over them , the migrants &quot; op@@ ted the border ! &quot; and un@@ locking ins@@ ults against the Hungarian pro@@ hibition police . &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border , on a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block , could not agree on a common immigration policy in Brussels at a meeting in Brussels . &quot;
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in cor@@ ro@@ sive Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would conclude that the EU states would receive another 120@@ .000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an active action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency meeting in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate the asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was also planning to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - having ended a fence along the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ outs were used to create , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are those who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the state of emergency , &quot; said spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters of Associ@@ ated Press have already viewed heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rating deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in cu@@ sto@@ dy and are accused of perpet@@ uation of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to handle the data of people and squ@@ ee@@ zed a crowd to meet there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can be candidates for the pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the pres@@ idential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , most democratic elec@@ tors say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant to their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while some profits scor@@ ed . &quot;
Clinton is holding a major lead in women and moder@@ ates but these j@@ umps have decreased .
your support in men is significantly reduced and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage among the older vot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin of the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic vot@@ ers nation@@ wide say they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
one neighborhood would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly excited about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would enthusi@@ as@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the pres@@ idential elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it is the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice president th@@ rows a potential for the pres@@ idential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the pres@@ idential elections are asked , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the foref@@ ront . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of their second choice .
&quot; if Bi@@ ds decide not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead increases ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; bending is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers p@@ ens out as un@@ acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important features among vot@@ ers of the pres@@ idential elections .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is best cutting the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic elec@@ tors do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it . &quot;
&quot; democratic vot@@ ers generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the demo@@ cra@@ cies of the pres@@ idential elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not affected altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 saying that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the elec@@ torate &apos;s elec@@ torate do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible vot@@ ers nation@@ wide see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes on tour . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son resi@@ des in the country @-@ wide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; in the meantime , half of the vot@@ ers &apos; support in the new pol@@ l , and others lose their support dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son well received demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ dir , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Scott Walker who has fallen in deep@@ est , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place . &quot;
the fault margin in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in surveys - with 19 % support with the repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a performance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values can only be measured remot@@ ely , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find hot water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people do not go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) shares . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a multi @-@ channel ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood took brutal attack by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital what contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and had been repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensi@@ ls and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood princip@@ ally on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ mer Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning on his injuries .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ si@@ fication , Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ lic@@ ted with d@@ ull power injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ gh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ane of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the chic@@ anes since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment because of murder third tier for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of de@@ crimin@@ ating attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also draw them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has b@@ anned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; interest will come , and the house @-@ se will fall into the banks , rent returns for bonds and the economy will slide into a rec@@ ession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little instructions on how to proceed . &quot;
a rec@@ ession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have stressed so viol@@ ently that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of an interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to Clients . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no consequences . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank anal@@ ysts in a more recent study on what happens after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , published by Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the In@@ cre@@ ased cycle and the margin of return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a rec@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; remark@@ ably , the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 stood only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in a frag@@ ile economic background could be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants made an interest in the F@@ ed interest rate throughout the year , and all eyes focused on the Federal Open Market Committee session this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the In@@ cre@@ ased cycles of 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in the GDP , and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights were put into the shade very quickly after the beginning of recovery . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is qui@@ cker than if they change their strategic course .
&quot; at bonds , the y@@ ields seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the In@@ cre@@ ased cycle , the bond endi@@ ces fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schwa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in bringing back bridges closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flat@@ tening of the curve .
&quot; high interest loans often result in better y@@ ields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin at Schwa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones means that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the earnings curve is f@@ latter , len@@ ding have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and worldwide businesses , which will handle the greater part of their business operations in the US , will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts will be worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and also the financing of their deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with a low balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital y@@ ields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by average each 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts become a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains by higher y@@ ields , even if experts in different opinion are how quickly that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham . &quot;
the Con@@ servative member of the parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster for his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly opposed to commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast , The Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that the private people do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ servative leader Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender is &quot; &quot; ev@@ oked &quot; &quot; and is increasingly difficult to differenti@@ ate from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ an@@ eously named examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC CEO dism@@ is@@ sed the alle@@ g@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf I really consider important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that he needed to work harder to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was put under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports , to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added that he would like the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there was an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the b@@ illing ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the output
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say there is now evidence that the online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to the year 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that happens , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the subsequent turnover . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times saw the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a British Retail Con@@ sortium study found out that from £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
&quot; for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident slain - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse in some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the deaths that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mek@@ ka &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to z@@ ol@@ len their respect , when the first of the dead step@@ ped up their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the proc@@ ession went over to the sacred site , where only days before a building crane went through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction on the construction company of the Bin Laden , because of the cat@@ astrophe , which also left 394 the wounded . &quot;
the bodies of 29 persons who were killed as a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central mo@@ cha of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to be the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to go to Mec@@ ca by thousands who continue to come to the city .
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group , said to have not stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , who rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which takes place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ min@@ ed the group because of not actual security measures and because it did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project run by the Bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Q@@ a@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dec@@ eased son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in 1990 @-@ 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered that 1 Million Re@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed , and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;

&quot; British increasingly employ crafts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
&quot; this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim at crafts@@ men , will be opened . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q points of sale nation@@ wide &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is claimed that Britain will lay down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European crafts@@ men who carry out the work in their homes .
&quot; if you can handle sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or brush to paint walls , nowadays it seems to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; for British increasingly employ crafts@@ men to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the company &apos;s boss is behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ market chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to grav@@ itation prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at crafts@@ men and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores because eight out of ten grocery shopping choices are taken by women .
at the moment the men out@@ wei@@ gh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , showing more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occup@@ ies almost 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and CF@@ O . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a drop in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
&quot; due to the trend King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ ich will have to answer on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and assignment .
the def@@ endants did not conf@@ ess themselves guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; by this accus@@ ation , he has been acqu@@ itted legally in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the Prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary study that the def@@ endants had been able to use funds for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he att@@ aches the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial fraud .
&quot; this fact was the leader of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; for the rejection of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense was that the association was at no time an asset to an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports facilities had only applied expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from deb@@ ts - the pas@@ si@@ vity amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood ahead of the situation : do we carry the club further or block we ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants told one of the def@@ endants in the financial profession of the financial ministry . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in the collection . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no deb@@ ts can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of financial success , the payment of compens@@ atory damages had been eff@@ ected retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expenses were paid only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus was paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; thus , flat and non @-@ detailed bookings also seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and text@@ books managed the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; why the out@@ flow of the association had not been exposed in detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial provision , it was important to have been the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the club account in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investig@@ ator because of office abuse . &quot;
&quot; this was the case , the accused said . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ endant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; after that , the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time . &quot;
&quot; then he thought , he thought that this was the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the compla@@ in@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary himself justified herself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage compensation . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; on this point , the first def@@ endant said that he did not agree with this wording , because the association had never made any damage to the association . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said he has never paid a cent sal@@ ary , he merely comp@@ uted mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ ets , he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expense would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
&quot; for the early years , the def@@ endants could not be indic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; these were no longer kept after an audi@@ ting , in which everything was judged correctly , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter money also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all containers must be held in cash , and he said in his statement from his residence international market to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main tre@@ ati@@ se will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard comp@@ ats more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to personnel degra@@ dation that has been running since three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs during the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the US computer lab Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) will be saved , distributed by the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; after all , the Hewlett @-@ Packard share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Group , which has become a large group of printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently un@@ folding - this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business segments are to be listed on the stock market .
a once again dis@@ appo@@ inting PC paragraph as well as a we@@ aker demand from corporate customers after its services translated the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , the revenues went back to 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP respon@@ ds with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and get more and more transactions online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rejected : 54 per cent said , 35 percent showed themselves agreed . &quot;
&quot; the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will find positive . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with Syrian rulers B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed declined , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : out@@ break of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights for several hundred depor@@ ted refugees .

he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line formed and a floo@@ d@@ light stood behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials first set off pep@@ per@@ spray .
&quot; after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn somewhat with@@ standing .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as cried .
other refugees s@@ acked in themselves and suffered under respiratory problems .
the police spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Pfe@@ ffer@@ spray .
time of deci@@ ding on interest rates for the US emergency bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US emergency service comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were ques@@ tioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates are held at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ under outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University left for compensation
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb sh@@ ou@@ ted a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; stated public authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , he had shot on someone and killed someone . &quot;
Lamb said the staff of the emergency center that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted it to und@@ o it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb was driving 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were killed . &quot;
&quot; President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb apparently believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb C@@ alled relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to j@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , Lamb drove his car aside , fle@@ w on foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a doc@@ torate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University .

&quot; in 2001 he fought against Leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;

all this calls for sure its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
the Group restructuring will cost 150 of the around 1000 exec@@ utives around the world .
&quot; with the pilot trade union , there are meanwhile new negotiations . &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the equity capital Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment was a contribution of some 500 million euros a year out of cost and redemption sy@@ ner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger &apos;s business . &quot;
the Eu@@ row@@ ings airline line should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the management team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120,000 employee was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pil@@ ots
&quot; in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot @-@ cleaning cock@@ pit ( VC ) , the negotiations should be res@@ umed after the tri@@ bunal on this Thursday . &quot;
they shared the union with them .
the issue of the talks should be the retirement provisions for pil@@ ots .
cock@@ pit wool &quot; will result in a year with a predic@@ ted record result as soon as possible .
the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pil@@ ots , the &quot; Wings &quot; concept . &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa in the fight against competi@@ tor routes def@@ ends the Group &apos;s own equity line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left foreign def@@ ender to cry and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and is located in the hospital .
he will be post@@ pon@@ ed tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al thought that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were pay@@ able .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; here , Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V &apos;s defeat . &quot;
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As The Netherlands Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving into another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax knows better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite child &apos;s book , the Minister @-@ President ruled for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead depic@@ ts an abstract of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ing @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would not be enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax Films , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ing @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing street speaker told that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s elec@@ toral bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ Camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der that has chosen England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting arrangement , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
here news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ ers are gear@@ ed towards results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I have said that - players are their own best choices . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he hopefully turns out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he did not produce such good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test hit gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only repro@@ ach that one can raise was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a hit man I guess . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scor@@ ed 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ ques next to Cook , which would produce an extra spin bowl and get four qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a Devil &apos;s guy from Cri@@ cket Player . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as op@@ ener .
he immediately made three hundred R@@ uns away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him , he really impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there &apos;s no big number of backup sp@@ inning that raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ ful coup . &quot;

the Bre@@ x@@ it War@@ ehouse ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy has been in a pl@@ um by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ finished new negoti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is It No Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which broke vigor@@ ously because of Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at and recently said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ ang@@ led in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own gu@@ ilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ es@@ sions and distur@@ bing contractual changes that they usually do not want to fill . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves facing a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants an outside of Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long endurance such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers even deliberately do not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend pres@@ umes . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a plague &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone , as they did not support it during the 1975 referendum in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all his rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing cu@@ cum@@ bers , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ states that most of our major newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better spread ban@@ anas to dist@@ ract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir denied the principle of the not adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which thereby opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never with@@ drawn it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed any more for me - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ he years to repeat , an error back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC set@@ tee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it out - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blu@@ ef@@ arm tendency and the wild ze@@ al of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Eng@@ lander can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in radio and television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ out fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns nom@@ ination of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their meeting on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whir@@ lpool of social media , a brood @-@ centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and tre@@ ason . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are fundamental am@@ big@@ ui@@ ties with EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite gay economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start any campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have also suspic@@ ious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ es@@ sions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded when starting Monday of something , which was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze report from Public Health England about E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et , critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &apos; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis &apos; where P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the statements are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ level decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to give their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was supposed to have received an independent study by British American Tob@@ acco Media ( BAT ) . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the Reference of BAT for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , said they . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he has received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing members of the committee are not delivered , but they include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the session .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most of the criteria &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions is discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s alle@@ g@@ ations have already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die each year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we meet our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC was to give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard disp@@ uted time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which were also clearly shown by not subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation into the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not make or do . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a jo@@ ke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded programs that could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give her right arm for it . &quot;
I would like to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue that when they go to their holy missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; for the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check out its Rei@@ fe@@ an mission to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada - to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; to question the partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses that have high frequencies for human ear to be heard .
&quot; the im@@ pulses function through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultr@@ asonic waves . &quot;
more on this topic : read researchers and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , used by ultras@@ ound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical im@@ pulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic bu@@ bb@@ les . &quot;
&quot; the bu@@ bb@@ les , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worm &apos;s cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons have TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ b@@ lower and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily pr@@ one the quoted human neur@@ ons for the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; VC@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which ruled around the advertising for the arms trade - through a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have been up@@ set - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces varies from easily irrit@@ ating to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell from wh@@ ence you get , if and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ Years , where you are standing in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a stap@@ le extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak even if your lashes were burned in fire and these ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are moving and their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ b culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ pfen : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
join Friend@@ ship through B@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of back Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to give you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep as@@ leep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken are a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook within . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate , adding a det@@ erg@@ ent to their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neigh@@ bors , whether they were doing something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when they finally finished at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neigh@@ bors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , completed her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic when your future spouse happened to enter the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be far too embarrass@@ ed if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse to dis@@ connect with them , to separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they all come across all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart passes his own ways - but if a hot mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a bit of reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security , but never forget someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put into the freezer - but put their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ raced houses for refugees , All @-@ in @-@ one , Ger@@ ling @-@ serving &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds ter@@ raced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; so , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room but also the mother and the poor . &quot;
&quot; I show how to get cheap and good build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flood of refugees , we need sufficient space for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a ter@@ raced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to the needs .

&quot; Gil@@ dner : true it is : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford one more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone may switch on half@@ way and lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

&quot; one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police of his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
on the grounds of the gas station there were also three people .
one of these men now cried out to the young man and put it into the face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nos@@ eb@@ and and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends rus@@ hed and compla@@ ined on the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed over there .
&quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the wounded in front of the building went to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and invested 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
&quot; also , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dorf &apos;s mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ den@@ hausen on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen , her husband , Karl @-@ Heinrich , is still standing at half a point in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was a sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ isti@@ s met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who are currently doing their training in the Dresden Hospital and wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage can fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I just inv@@ oked her . &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea of operating their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon . &quot;
and so one agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Lith@@ onia @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; he grew up there in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and volunte@@ ered in the DRC application of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
&quot; during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a veter@@ in@@ arian . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the renovation the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; as part of a funding program of the administrative district ( 25@@ ,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the Müll@@ ers receive a subsi@@ dy of EUR 500@@ 00 . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ i mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ den@@ hausen every quarter , in the north German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
&quot; if no successor has been found , she would have gone too . &quot;
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers consult@@ ations also continues to look above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the puri@@ fication of the rock faces .
&quot; with their f@@ are@@ well , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the medical professionals have practic@@ ed there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot;
a little melan@@ chol@@ y she felt after the long time .
&quot; but we continue living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
your husband adds laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I always pressed myself on gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; however , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask a asylum application can &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; do so . &quot;
the supply and safety of people are in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , not via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia ins@@ ulates &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany , under certain circumstances also to er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , however , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the external border of the Sch@@ engen area .
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not le@@ ak up its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government ran , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to arrive in East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could interv@@ ene in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik perpet@@ u@@ ated police vehicles with new refugees ever since . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
&quot; in the coming days , his country expects about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had hi@@ ther@@ to mig@@ rant to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Bel@@ grade denied that it is it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do that , &quot; was it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus arrived with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border away from Serbia .
&quot; we heard that Hungary admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could actually come to a slightly further west distance of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners face a good testimony to the country ever since , which concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ grade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , both Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g border cross@@ ings continue to be completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees are now wanting to go on to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to so@@ ot@@ he on Wednesday morning at a local appearance in Hor@@ gos , keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not be about very high refugee numbers .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
helping migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian country still not cleared mine fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers in the border region was sent . &quot;

&quot; that not everyone wants to publicly dis@@ agree on the boards is understand@@ able , but finally it is a very personal thing . &quot;

Fed@@ Ex reported dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter and the Gi@@ ver Gig@@ ant increased its profit outlook for a whole year because of the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wishes to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. promised to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than the previous forecast . &quot;

&quot; the company said it nevertheless expects that the result compared to the previous year will increase due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid y@@ ields , considering the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holidays employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS , who plans to adjust 90@@ .000 to 95@@ ,000 additional labor force , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million were earning 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research ques@@ tioned anal@@ ysts predic@@ ted . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack asked anal@@ ysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
&quot; over the past few years , Fed@@ Ex has reported a drop in international priority shipping , which brought revenue in its unit express shipment to st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in the bo@@ d@@ transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market Trade , approximately one hour before the opening , Fed@@ Ex stocks declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th . &quot;
&quot; at its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen passed two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot of Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ oni table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; threatening about them at an end of the galvan@@ ized , two @-@ storey seat of the seat , there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be p@@ amper@@ ed by the un@@ preced@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the near @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the previously si@@ ghted F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity through raising interest for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently ques@@ tioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predic@@ ted an interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets however expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists alle@@ vi@@ ate the beat by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average rank by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift up the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the pro@@ position expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market this year was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the top of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation as to how to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ den , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he pres@@ upp@@ oses that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency office has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow down their monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; dissolved del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to obtain a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the Financial Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which apparently did not inter@@ fere with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ner , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to an interest rate , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia pushed the F@@ ed to lower its loans by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on the growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives und@@ o these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears real interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I do not believe that it should be ahead of time . &quot;

more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
preparing a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach with her 74 L@@ ences .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it in asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is quite different from school than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes nour@@ ishment for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women in sho@@ cking ways how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should carry out . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be f@@ latter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym@@ nas@@ tics building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : during the recent meeting of the municipal council the completed construction application was lo@@ wered without major discussions .
&quot; prior to that , the Panel had also adopted an application for a construction legal exception &quot; &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was a permit for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; this means that a &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; should be erected with non @-@ cor@@ ro@@ sive first and roof over@@ lap . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderful large south roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; there was again the inc@@ lin@@ ation required for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the cultivation plan has no &quot; exceptions &quot; concerning the inc@@ lin@@ ation - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council rather restri@@ ctive in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the National Council for Ex@@ amination . &quot;

the Pei@@ o@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of the staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the day next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further inner inner station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , the employees who cannot work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the internal station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer will be working with his team if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ hip , which has more than 35 beds , should be finally closed in Pei@@ o@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , if the currently ongoing refur@@ bish@@ ment at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chair of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily circulation psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ rel@@ ocation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understand@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where fishermen have been working as chief doctor for more than 30 years , have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
&quot; the hospital of Pei@@ ssen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been under threat again and again in recent decades , com@@ partments were closed , such as surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , a total of 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; for this result , a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ aler Housing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; with this , 140@@ .000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an accommodation . &quot;
many then push to the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is pushing a defic@@ it in front of itself , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently around 7@@ 0,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working people lived in large cities not@@ with@@ standing in room @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the f@@ lau@@ te on the housing market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has declined for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; pro@@ poses a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new inc@@ enti@@ ves should revi@@ ve the social housing construction . &quot;
this could be om@@ itted on the land tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dised flats will be limited .
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy program for refugee camps of the state bank K@@ f@@ W is already well established in towns and villages .
a good week after the start on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had been retri@@ eved .
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary , practically no coming through , there are more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous though .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and belongs already to the Sch@@ engen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Sch@@ engen country .
&quot; after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported on the Croatian television channel RTL . &quot;
Hungary has sealed off its border for refugees on the day of the day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically elimin@@ ates the need for su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , most came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d both by bus and ta@@ xis .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees are not on a border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines out of the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , no more refugees arrive after the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 366 cont@@ ested people .
shortly before the opening on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
&quot; the new Hungarian laws , over@@ coming and dam@@ aging the border count as a crime . &quot;
&quot; therefore , 35 pen@@ al procedures were initiated in the south @-@ Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the condemned prison sentences up to five years and the de@@ port@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit zones , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - the most important Tran@@ sition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be depor@@ ted there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up with it .
they collected the gar@@ bage that had left thousands of people left at the road@@ side during the past few weeks .
lock lat@@ tice was disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border place was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reach a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; however , about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the request of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
Mayor drove &quot; bor@@ dered &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the clearing on Sunday after the bridge on Sunday , when ten people with travel companions were at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly dis@@ continued the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ ed the Arab@@ s along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; before we first checked the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pas@@ sau by car . &quot;
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to Pas@@ sau in Wels on Sunday evening in a regional train to Pas@@ sau to try it after the short @-@ term announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still on the border . &quot;
the regional train was shut off at the river Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neigh@@ bors on Sunday closed on Sunday morning a two @-@ year run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent another Z@@ ig@@ nia to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of being in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures to ensure humanity , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has officially opened the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st circle of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; the p@@ oultry will also have to notice that the &apos; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &apos; , which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seeking . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

Konrad has fully dealt with the refugee teaching of all hands .
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success . &quot;
&quot; the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also accommod@@ ated without a big whir@@ l@@ wind , &quot; said Konrad , praised the organisational &quot; master power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke about a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ .000 quartz in the he@@ ur@@ ged year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are supposed to provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the coun@@ cill@@ ors he has already held talks .
they would have promised him to create lod@@ g@@ ings for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it runs fine , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born . it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodations on the platform .
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that qu@@ arti@@ ers have to hold a certain height of the tow@@ el holder or the size of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he is more successful with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any costs , as they themselves stated . &quot;
their number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
&quot; so far , our own district search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz is calling for a better division
&quot; first of all , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for Refu@@ ge@@ es plan the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently under@@ mine those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be checked for their suitability . &quot;
criticism of the City of the City on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other areas have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone line with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has also acquired additional action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the guards would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , he once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , Austria is now also &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general rehabilitation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial row is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology segment . &quot;
&quot; in IT the intelligent heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in Start@@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft , and later to acquire some of them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours , which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises quite a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2,@@ 700 square meters of rest in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are in@@ quiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni owner opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; actually , Jutta Brei@@ t wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : finally , she has received a further growth in the form of another business . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop compared to the business in which they sell , among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , all around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I thought for a long time whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Brei@@ t . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own place where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Gre@@ ater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
their fashion interest has put Brei@@ t from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman can not answer with the last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a nice bag evalu@@ ates every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants were called An@@ gi@@ ator .
&quot; some people also associate with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it appe@@ als to foreign hos@@ tility , journalists are sc@@ rut@@ in@@ ised or revealed in international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. pres@@ idency strikes the campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire origin@@ ate . &quot;
the New Yorker with the p@@ amper@@ ing hair@@ style is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to him about -@@ ty corners with him .
&quot; his grand@@ father came out of K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , among which beside Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit &apos; a big mau@@ l &apos; , Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the k@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - in high German : the sponsor , says . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were the first real estate acquis@@ itions in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of trage@@ dy : their desire to return to homeland in the long run , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was filed without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film launch . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker , retired , sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension vert@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm shows how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine this by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ y@@ ings at the time of his grand@@ father in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , which was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 k@@ og@@ gers , even in the US , the interest aw@@ akes . &quot;
the Upper Bavaria municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as reserve .
&quot; seven &apos;s sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Charles Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shi@@ fts in the reviews for Today . &quot;
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the u@@ prising seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sunrise realis@@ es an average of 39@@ 7@@ .000 spectators at the five capit@@ als , compared to today today 3@@ 39@@ .000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today the gap to Sunrise has closed in the past few months .
&quot; in August Today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 330@@ ,000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September , Sunrise at an average of 3@@ 49@@ .000 spectators stands at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect those morning people more than parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven was strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers , and hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e resulted in an average of 4@@ 46@@ .000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang up to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13@@ .000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 viewers and the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ seat average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ seat will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute that didn &apos;t make it to over@@ flow the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three voices handed over : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may not know@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally ends Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally gave an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood has sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have in ly@@ ric way om@@ itted why wood is the perfect man and therefore called his sense of hum@@ or , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to receive Woo@@ ds last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers become a game spo@@ iler who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between s@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL &apos;s career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches had b@@ anned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t during his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a p@@ unt return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his desp@@ ised mu@@ zzle and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , who was restored in the first playing quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian sponsor@@ ship for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; after the F@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL &apos;s career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compar@@ es the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Goal setting led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;
Hay@@ ne posed for a picture with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agram .
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of the gay people

&quot; free vot@@ ers demand the recru@@ itment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get uph@@ e@@ av@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
open @-@ day fra@@ ction of the Free Di@@ ers will meet up to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees also domin@@ ates the Free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the c@@ law , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective areas for refugees in Syria as it existed during the war in the 1990s .
&quot; so it does not go on , we must follow the causes , &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; We also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the FW leader cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we need nation@@ wide uniform standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria post@@ pon@@ es , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the regional policy should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt . &quot;
a long term burner remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; in 47 Gym@@ na@@ sien in which an extension of the upper @-@ secondary intermediate level has been tested from three to four years - in the result it takes nine years to finish . &quot;
but this is not far enough of Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the issue G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW leader . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on j@@ umps
&quot; after a long distance , the German stock market has closed down land@@ less and nervous trading course with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon , a fir@@ mer op@@ ener of the US ex@@ changes ensured a clear direction that ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points . &quot;
&quot; the MD@@ ax of medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;
technology @-@ based Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.0@@ 3 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the Euro@@ St@@ ox 50 as the Eurozone &apos;s leading index fell by 1.0@@ 1 percent to 320@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also booked trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index recorded approximately 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many stock markets anticip@@ ate that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big decline in the schedule on this Friday .
the discussion about the burden of nuclear power has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in a meantime to a record low and also left deep marks at E@@ on .
&quot; according to the &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy groups may lack some 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures given in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6,@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.9 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; according to a re@@ ta@@ iler , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took effect from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; therefore , investors gave too little attention to the German chip maker . &quot;
investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should be paid .
&quot; car values were asked : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were again set off than in the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA managed to launch the International Motor Show I@@ AA in Frankfurt . &quot;

4 people killed after police officers shoot on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber sho@@ ots into a crowd fighting against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district official , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and then pushed into the air before returning to rubber shells .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber shells , known to them that they can kill but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high mort@@ ality rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ ett@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal on the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislat@@ ors accelerated the trial after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislat@@ ors voted this week over certain cl@@ auses in the constitution of Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the land at Em@@ der Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be re@@ constructed .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; planned is a mix of trade , trade and housing - but there is still no concrete offer . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters large property in direct vicinity to the Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post .
the preparations for this are under@@ way .
&quot; it is planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , trade and housing . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it &apos;s called on the part of the city . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is situated on the ring road / corner of the Große Straße , just a few months ago , and the building had to be torn down . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some owners are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure time
&quot; for months , behind closed doors were negoti@@ ated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the v@@ ested interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ der Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends passed from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
&quot; the project , which is about ten to twelve million Euros , has been in discussion for months . &quot;
&quot; violent reactions among the land@@ lords , who had come to the meeting , empha@@ sized the images and new details on the desired hotel structure . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the land@@ owner and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that the traffic would increase strongly due to the planned size of the plant : &quot; there must be whole lot of bus stops , so that this is reck@@ oning , &quot; &quot; said Martin Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the gut a hect@@ are of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
nor is there any operator .
&quot; first we must have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google laun@@ ches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are searching for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / Tablets to be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed over 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or o@@ besity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; over the years , o@@ besity surgery has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are sick @-@ o@@ bes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as o@@ bes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ v@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which have been collected in a study since 2007 , compar@@ es two types of o@@ besity surgery - Mag@@ b@@ ypass and Mag@@ h@@ ash formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical Diabetes Care around 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes illness was completely dissolved and at 28 % partial . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the type of diabetes completely dissolved in one percent and partly with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the checks of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as it reflects in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased responses in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avi@@ est people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was with o@@ bes@@ e people who under@@ went o@@ besity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without higher risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start losing weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have strongly connected their bodies with o@@ besity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is increasingly recognized in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ attractive at school times , meets the flock of her youth for years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa B@@ inder .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Long@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot absor@@ b all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader asked for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama talked about the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford focusing on ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terror attack of 11 September and revealed that the violent response of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama said . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of exposure of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ lows strong alcoholic hand des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported to report the po@@ ison control centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and s@@ adly a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally , while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of cheap experiences .
young people have suppos@@ edly shu@@ ff@@ led dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wat@@ ering to get a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand san@@ iti@@ zer ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few squ@@ ir@@ rels can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in inf@@ ants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison control center at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , station Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ key around but people leave this hand san@@ iti@@ zer in reach of children , and when children come from it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lit@@ ters from after straw@@ berry scent dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally dr@@ unken with an adult , said Dr. Chris RIT@@ CHE@@ Y , a emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit his head , said RIT@@ CHE@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ aries and to store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ont@@ ario women after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York decided to po@@ ison their &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; teacher by expres@@ sing anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , so reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their space .
&quot; the police viewed the failed plan as &quot; &quot; s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish Football is bor@@ ed Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former Rang@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an amb@@ assador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic Games any more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
you speak about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ar Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic struggles must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stood clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that just that way - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is increasing in the UK .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom increased to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period as a whole . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statistics Bureau ( ONS ) showed . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .

&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , he will see it emotion@@ less . &quot;
I cannot do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; prison officials say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined with her .
&quot; she dre@@ amt that she could &quot; &quot; form@@ ulate her better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the pod@@ casts series I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to whom you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was persu@@ aded the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to go back to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called in pel@@ vic ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape to the C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he was standing in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and ho@@ l me , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ sist@@ c was not very enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ated . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him and thre@@ aten racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing , and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tester at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the sp@@ ying alle@@ g@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home t@@ onight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to change my head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying to do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had prepared the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity @-@ department had tried to sp@@ y his stall . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
&quot; has the RV@@ L beha@@ ves co@@ war@@ dly , and perhaps makes people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the train@@ ers &apos; fru@@ str@@ ations have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt test , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Caviar , described the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s bill , which met the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day as it was .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation into this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a jo@@ ke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is gone too far , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
man was arrested by the driver of the driver
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man with a cycl@@ ist and a passenger flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries by helic@@ opter , after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway . &quot;
&quot; the police said , the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver . &quot;
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia appeared to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ au@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ sed and abandoned assistance and for other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains at the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Setting &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favorites in the N@@ RL . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring matches &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly cover@@ t note to the Storm team after his team scor@@ ed the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land do not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the t@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said they were focused solely on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; with the Tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his crew agree that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that appears again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring @-@ fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our defen@@ sive system or techniques all year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has been the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not ac@@ custom@@ ed to lose , so it was a bit of shock to him . &quot;
it is already funny how this time emerg@@ es again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; in 2010 , Benn@@ etts has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne says of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a trick . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of soccer to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
&quot; also , Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ sters scor@@ ed a higher score than the Bron@@ cos play against cow@@ boys . &quot;
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t looked at it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are p@@ auses and do not have any points of interest ?
for me it is the maps .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team is free on this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin in the next Tuesday morning . &quot;

&quot; a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led to Que@@ ens@@ land , was fre@@ ed for a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu , and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ ida@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Justice Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he rep@@ u@@ di@@ ates his Australian and Ser@@ b Pass , who reports on a daily departure from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
an accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
a truck driver has been seriously injured when a car accident took three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to turn left to the left at the last moment , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ induced embr@@ yo completely broke apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed completely over six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to attract ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , log@@ ised into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the bewil@@ dering news and immediately aler@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research which used terms to search for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; gave a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to terri@@ fy ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said that he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of ra@@ pe and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mb@@ ling and crying . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the Indi@@ ct@@ ment to have in@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 last year to have viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear before court appearance on March 24 this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one might argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; may be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael left the verdi@@ ct until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in cu@@ sto@@ dy because of hear@@ ings to other remaining cases . &quot;
it was still recorded before the date of the judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up away from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ users suffered from fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man from the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river River Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn district since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ub@@ s to the German side .
there they are taken in reception by federal police and forwar@@ ded to the registration .
&quot; in contrast to the beginning of the week , a lot more refugees arrived at the Munich train station in comparison with the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone at 8@@ am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the city was reached on Tuesday 17@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : tropical Storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest &quot;
met@@ eor@@ ologists warn against storm bees in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drawn by the Bermuda Islands over the past days . &quot;
fier@@ ce stor@@ ms and thunder@@ stor@@ ms are expected above all in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning it is also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with goats from 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ s show their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is above all to draw attention to the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently especially popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell to this segment in August alone in August .
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( audience stage 17th to 27th September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German motor@@ sport sector is the Opel Astra which will be at dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not expected to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry under the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 990 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp to which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variation will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively a five @-@ door in a conventional and a empha@@ sized sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in trade it will come early next year , then also as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan dec@@ or wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the base model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Nm ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not brand new but completely renewed is the DS 4 compact model , which can be seen on the I@@ AA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers placed a hand on the front end : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology were equipped . &quot;
&quot; the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was mainly moderni@@ zed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants on the I@@ AA in the compact class like the frozen Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human dignity
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court admitted to an ex @-@ prison@@ er of the judicial system Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; the suffer@@ ers may even hope for money if they were im@@ pris@@ oned in confin@@ ed spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prison@@ er with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who is now on the open foot after his lawyer &apos;s data was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warran@@ t for the in@@ decent conditions of det@@ ention against the land of Berlin failed .
but the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and returned the case for renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht shall now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of arrest for compensation are author@@ it@@ ative , an equilibrium was given , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen@@ ing the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al now has to clarify the amount of money .
&quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of pen@@ al prisoners . &quot;
&quot; so they said in April a prison@@ er of damage , because he was det@@ a@@ ined naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to 2011 , the multi @-@ occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had certi@@ fies a decent housing to a prison@@ er in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot;
the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was held every day between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; for this reason prisoners are always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to pun@@ ches it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial black@@ mail , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 are to fall off in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany in accordance with the Federal Ministry of Justice this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decis@@ i@@ veness in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do it .
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , the next five years are needed . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : between 600@@ 00 and 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the rental price binding every year , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees are also allowed to apply . &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings per year would have to arise and therefore , the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal Government agree that there must be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
&quot; according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the p@@ oultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says immigration researchers Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while in the past there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the short@@ age of skilled labour , there is a majority of the visibility that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of knowledge of German .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is therefore , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration noted that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ ebel , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration hand@@ ing distri@@ butes them in various languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example by allowing more trade schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared for lessons without knowledge of German . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by educated teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ age of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or patient the study - the only exception has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position . &quot;
studying willing to grant access to university could be facilit@@ ated .
&quot; because refugees with a residence permit or cancellation do not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law , if they start studying . &quot;
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g as they do not fall under the circle of the legitimate people .
&quot; patient refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years , in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this margin will be shor@@ tened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must also be closed , require Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; in future Islam will play an important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually con@@ v@@ ene the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him some control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the read@@ iness to take place against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to prosec@@ ute such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - a decade ago an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general gender equality law .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German call for a long time and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention of Germany undertake , must become reality in the coming years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees , ob@@ serving Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system for this . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all the new@@ com@@ ers from the registration of health cards . &quot;
rendered services could later be settled with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to trace so many people with the limited service catalogue which the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are doing the language barriers especially . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health schol@@ ar The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are more aware of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpre@@ ting costs should not only be applied in clinics , even in medical practices . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general health centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; there are clearly more untreated disabilities in refugee camps , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; but German doctors came from their training with some other diseases , but Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; the paras@@ ite case or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as regards medical marijuana , the refugees may possibly even have relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , and several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and possibly need to take examinations . &quot;
at least half of the refugees coming to Germany are mentally ill following estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post@@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; he is particularly vulnerable to refugee children , declar@@ es Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study at the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee boy is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death an@@ xi@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe dist@@ res@@ ence and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent symptoms being chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social com@@ missions , experts or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ interpre@@ tations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group to the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now the Circus Pro@@ bst , in the Man@@ ege on the brick , invites you to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an instructor and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the actual stage of the estate .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for master@@ ing lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ oti@@ ck@@ tail with world city fla@@ ir , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this fla@@ ir .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ br@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies the Cub@@ an duo will pick up loose .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is supposed to con@@ quer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ v@@ ae , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and joint . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ icy@@ cle on a ball ?
for He Yuan is not a problem .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from the eyes upon possibility of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to enter the arena . &quot;
the highest commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; the Pro@@ bst family is proud of its zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst , from 17 to 20 September , invites every day at 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , the prices are reduced for the performance at 5@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal preview is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions a false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also am@@ ended by alle@@ g@@ ations of the opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe from Mr Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; last month , they had stopped him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politi@@ cian SMS messages have received SMS messages on their phones , which they warned against interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in Parliament will end , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25@@ ,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected foot@@ print will result in a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenues and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ developed , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill , Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. Tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely foc@@ uss@@ ed companies deliver better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the play against dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain . &quot;
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old moment@@ um during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in contact with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical viewpoint , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd shows 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 from Arsen@@ al 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five playing times .
&quot; the broader picture for sen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have failed to record most of the injuries . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win fighting strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deser@@ ves . &quot;
Arsen@@ al ki@@ cks off its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need to get a little break for a break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured in the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn out the lesson of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven away from distant hope , with his management to lead the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ opy victory . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how su@@ icide rates among young men prove at a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Aga@@ inst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( CAL@@ M - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men hin@@ dered by seeking help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suffer@@ er had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of recovery are doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication held by social media , focusing on style about substance , immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , mer@@ ry and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic value ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this foc@@ uss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football matches in cozy sessions and the desire for Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it , even if they often stop to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the telephone ministry , I explained : ... &quot; my hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endanger@@ ed , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying , &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when talking about problems openly . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men @-@ friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of desp@@ air , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the totally re@@ designed setting for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
my friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ festival
Santa Maria meets to help PSG to cr@@ ush Hun@@ ed@@ o@@ ara
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria runs in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass over to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as the PSG player , who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scor@@ ed a head @-@ ball@@ ast in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they are not only aiming at the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he later became involved in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents issues and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected over the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;m sorry we did not have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could hold a 2 : 2 oun@@ ces at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was thrown out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ storm was referred to as the man who was taken on the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense before he ended up nicely in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off suggested to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field was a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed away far from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they had little attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PSG itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had not only scrat@@ ched in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill if he put his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned the Di Maria into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2. minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second gate was finally dropped shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scor@@ ed his sixth year of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had refres@@ hed a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö was able to return to the game , and only an excellent attack from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the end result even before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last champ@@ ions League match was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then we only played in the Swedish le@@ ague , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualifying matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ enc@@ ore g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ by share sales
&quot; mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ enc@@ ore , resident in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , gathered 2.5 billion $ by a share of stock sales as part of its huge debt reduction plan . &quot;
&quot; the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares in the value of about 1.6 billion £ to pay off its own deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , fights with falling raw material prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses the demand and devast@@ ating on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of reference rights brought Glen@@ cor@@ es &apos;s stock exchange to the top of the London stock exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share stood at 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced last week the 2.5 billion share of stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to exter@@ min@@ ate around one third of its $ 30 billion deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new investments to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent reduction on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , took place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosted by X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yu@@ an at a state dinner after the two leaders had bilateral discussions .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and Europe champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion League winner , twice world champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
in the summer the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years left FC Barcelona and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was already standing before the beginning of 2008 before the departure of Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; in that time Madrid won everything , we did nothing , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ er@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not shift
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how to run Bavarian &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi was for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s victory at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film creation
firm of the Year for Real Estate Ash@@ ur@@ st Firm of the Year for Private Construction Luther Firm of the Year for Energy
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown collap@@ sed as this empha@@ sized the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with ins@@ ul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian rec@@ essed . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the F@@ ARRE@@ LL@@ Y brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; Brown initially said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line which is defeated by her white te@@ ther . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on rep@@ lied that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Mr Po@@ oni put his anger on the clip by writing Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement achieved Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter nation@@ wide and ur@@ ged legislat@@ ors and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against color . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , the leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement has published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media opinions invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
&quot; professional sport cli@@ m@@ ber and assistant help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening , and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant that could complete all levels of his obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time , with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero concluded this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the fier@@ ce victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his b@@ unch of money . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Britain , even though he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he gets a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warrior was extended for a long season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;

MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; once they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing in the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins wa@@ sted a chance to climb inside a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American le@@ ague game card .
&quot; for Detroit , al@@ beit for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp for a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon stab@@ bed his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ ents since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has well curved the punch , &quot; &quot; said Hen@@ rik . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , saw clearly better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inner ring , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a b@@ unt and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before replacing it with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the finish line at the second brought Ver@@ hagen the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe a double play .
it was in the Major League leading the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe had beat a double play
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of ninth Inn@@ ings , Wall made an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ Don and scor@@ ed the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited for the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scor@@ ed three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been das@@ hed out of the vulner@@ ability list before the game had lack@@ ed more than a month because of a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , Hus@@ bands released a single second to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z launched Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right hand , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , scor@@ ed a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not very well beaten , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scor@@ ed no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter liabilities .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since the middle of August on the vulner@@ ability list , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to start the Tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since it was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he has been missing since 20 August because of a ti@@ red@@ ness in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the Tw@@ ins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency lod@@ g@@ ings in Wiesbaden , like the City Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse for the first recording of the government pres@@ idency . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency accommodations in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the deci@@ de@@ dly thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he presented the European states &quot; collective displac@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German amb@@ assador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF and nobody was sent back to Hungary .
Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees passed from Hungary to Austria over the past few days .
your goal is mostly Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , applied for a special summit next week . &quot;
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU countries have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis so far . &quot;
&quot; on the coming Tuesday ( September 22 ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of additional 120,000 refugees in a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee retreat in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with Prime Minister in the German Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , prof@@ ess this too . &quot;
&quot; but if you have no perspective , you cannot stay in Germany too . &quot;
this view had been squ@@ ee@@ zed in the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole now must cope with a &quot; &quot; enormous effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , thousands of des@@ perate refugees are stuck on the Bal@@ kans . &quot;
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania will also bar with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats depar@@ ting from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan promp@@ tly .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had bl@@ ended the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , there were thousands more migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot;

this includes researchers from observ@@ ations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon stag@@ gers on its run@@ way around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; this de@@ af movement is small , but nevertheless too large for a continuous heavenly body , it is said in a communication from the Cor@@ nell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean has not been cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to give up approximately one month on the offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis is &quot; expected for four weeks . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gun the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a consistent pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defen@@ sive . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .

tor@@ h@@ unters Rubin Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training once a week after his bra@@ ins .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to get into running training . &quot;
&quot; at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured at a violent clas@@ h on the head . &quot;
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ gan@@ os contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gan@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
&quot; because man@@ gan@@ os contain relatively large amounts of sugar , especially su@@ cro@@ se . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In most cases Mang@@ os contain plenty of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor ß @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits therefore supports ten@@ ure , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gan@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly smell . &quot;
the peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gan@@ os can taste very tasty .
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives also sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it soft@@ ens the slightly bitter taste of some leaves such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

&quot; on Thursday morning the fo@@ eh@@ n goes out of the air , as a result , a cold @-@ front with strong , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland rolls over Switzerland . &quot;

&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , but in the South it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome has now a Martin Luther Square
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a hi@@ ther@@ less place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honored as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome adjacent to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority . &quot;
with the square I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a sin@@ ful sin @-@ bear .
his negative impressions might have encouraged him in the view of histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the off @-@ blow@@ n trade .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thor@@ ns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , this may seem quite dark . &quot;
&quot; for three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ hood are created . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he spont@@ an@@ eously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on artificial books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tures chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible of Martin Luther , and each of them with a pro@@ position of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry band has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old offers twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; ultimately , emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant ruler . &quot;
&quot; since the education has already happened with the cane stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
I have tried to re@@ vise this in order to be able to forgive me perhaps again with the Lord .
&quot; his second concern is to bring art back to more importance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is no@@ isy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewers &quot; fall into the pictures , &quot; discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture seeks his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; old did not pay attention to comprehen@@ ding the Bible completely , but the most important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans to find space , company commissioned to model earth hill for a round course : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured dr@@ y@@ ness , especially with the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill was depor@@ ted , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the First Municipal Council Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck can now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga begins a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ensures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday at the Chancellor &apos;s office and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic certainly plays a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out needs to be the policy .
the German Football Association has therefore wi@@ dened its refugee initiatives &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ liga support this program .
&quot; already at this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sporting director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ intel@@ li@@ gi@@ bility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the fu@@ gi@@ tive drama goes everyone , nobody can see away . &quot;
&quot; we can use football , no , we must use our jet force , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the le@@ ague . &quot;
the national team of the women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale invites 100 refugees on this Friday .
Nier@@ sbach reported the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements in their places had started their own projects , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also retri@@ eved the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ sbach . &quot;

&quot; the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he dropped to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then turned out to the road - that told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; SZ . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; SZ &quot; : &quot; everyone can pass something like this . &quot;
it &apos;s important to get up again when you fell .

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Weiden@@ F@@ eller in the Gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken down in the first round of the Europa League group . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high intensity of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his tri@@ bal position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the pe@@ at position .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Weiden@@ er will take the seat of the master crafts@@ man Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if wil@@ low dish will be used in all European le@@ ague games , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the research fellow player Re@@ us said that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl as understand@@ able : &quot; that is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to play a pione@@ ering role in Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the home of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , sees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states which come together with representatives of industry at the I@@ AA .
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a quick rise to digital radio transmission . &quot;
the testing of new technology is currently on a test track on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to avoid the driver &quot; no additional risks of liability , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; review the legal framework &quot; and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to deplo@@ y for example internationally that the permissible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 mph . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ ee the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicle @-@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; can be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimates the authors of the study by 2025 to some 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital network of passenger cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic @-@ politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Insp@@ ection Reg@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be en@@ forced in the coming ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 per cent do not believe at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 2025 reck@@ oned with aut@@ on@@ ome driving cars , in the United States 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent in flowing traffic could imagine on the highway , 45 percent in traffic . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the present stand , Düsseldorf will only be able to beat the title battle between 25 September and 4 October only in single . &quot;
the final decision will be cancelled at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guys have experienced it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship event in China . &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is born on Friday Z@@ UR@@ Ü@@ CK@@ ER@@ WAR@@ TE@@ T .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the settlements in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; by this we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; stated the World Tran@@ sit @-@ Fi@@ fth . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant I@@ ver
the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of fashion scene - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the Ver@@ f@@ ant I@@ ver of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his first rej@@ ecting attitude towards a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it , because &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ thei@@ der . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man , who has written fashion history without ever having completed an appren@@ tic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is a perfectly chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort was carried out : to fres@@ hen up the d@@ olls , for example , a st@@ ylist is engaged . &quot;
14 tons of material gathered the makers according to the cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest a special delic@@ acy was still there : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , agile , fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed up his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , including Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , for example to cover ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ vements . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past stylis@@ tic periods , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t have any niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
desp@@ air P@@ lau@@ en together with nine other companies is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery industry association .
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken off . &quot;
private specialty stores and wholes@@ alers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , up to date to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points on how C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains von der Stick@@ bead in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year , we have been introducing a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Applied Sciences - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , we have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a gap between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses , who have to think of everything economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only slightly varies in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball head . &quot;
the machine cho@@ cks small kit@@ chens at some places .
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewelry .
in a elaborate process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - primarily to clients who have lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to mem@@ ori@@ ze them . &quot;
I see my jewellery as the modern amb@@ assador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; you should not touch le@@ gends , but Disney is still dar@@ ing for a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re@@ foot@@ ing but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the global economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .

XI Com@@ es to open the economy broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy needs to open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new moment@@ um and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the resident status system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , which identi@@ fies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it has allocated a major role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a right @-@ state business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct business .
the statement also said that China will allow mar@@ ginal areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and deliver better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilitates the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee lawyers &quot; right to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in an explanation published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus reduce the consumption of a significantly higher dose of the drug .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , has critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of fail@@ ing industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full force in pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve det@@ ox should be lifted for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish for economic policy reasons , from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily charged with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the still existing limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be un@@ pol@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to this attra@@ ct@@ ance , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low bur@@ dened so that they already hold the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans and is strongly anch@@ ored over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; small amounts of especially in the case of un@@ born damages of the nervous system &quot; can be caused . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly due to carbon combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information provided by the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations carried out more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and comprehensive crossed , &quot; had c@@ ited the &quot; Spiegel &quot; from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
