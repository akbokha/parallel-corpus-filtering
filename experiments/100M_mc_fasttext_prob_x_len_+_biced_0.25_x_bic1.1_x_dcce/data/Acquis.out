&quot; each state applies to the organization , including their assets , assets and balances , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of the agreement on the rights and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ arding measures after this agreement are concluded with regard to nuclear material , when the Community and the organization realize that the material consum@@ es or has been dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer use@@ able or is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with this Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the disclosure of core material from the states that are subject to the security measures according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ arding measures after this agreement will be concluded with regard to nuclear material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in the Convention , has taken responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents from which any transmission and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the securing measures on the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association shall agree with the organisation of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated according to this agreement in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nucleus bodies .
B ) The organization and the community make a provision that the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under which circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is fed back to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held over the entire quantity and the composition of this material in the respective state , or the material concerned , and beyond any transfer of such material from this state or states on the ongoing . &quot;
&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or an under secret protection of the military activity and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community , the States or persons liable to their sovereign authority , however extraordinary costs as a result of a special investigation of the organization , the organisation reimbur@@ ses these costs as long as it has been agreed upon in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the organization &apos;s inspec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , is applicable to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that the Community or a State vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organisation vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organisation vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or a State for damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - has been established in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examination of the relevant information provided by the Director General , the Council determines that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , shall be ref@@ unded in accordance with Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if applicable , also the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council considers in which mass is obtained by the applied securing measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is affected - any reasonable opportunity to give the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; consultations on questions of the organisation , community or state can be consul@@ ted on questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention . &quot;
the Community and States are entitled to request that questions which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of the measures adopted by the Council after Article 19 or a measure adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not agreed upon by the organisation , the Community and the States shall submit to an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal on the request of a party , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named so named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who will pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organisation have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days after the application for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the designation or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been selected . &quot;
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention comes into effect for non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract , and members of the Community , in force , i ) when the state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of the Convention are concluded and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) When the Community of the Organization states that it is in a position to apply its security measures to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the Community and the States consult each other for seeking one of the contracting parties on a change in the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the Organization , Community and States . &quot;
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization of any amendment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention appears on the day in which the organisation of the Community and States receives the written notification , that their procedures for the entry into force are concluded . &quot;
B ) This Convention will remain in force as long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
the term used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures determined in this agreement is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bodies for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such a turn by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the inspection by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material not proven for a particular period is specified under indication of the accuracy limits for the indicated me@@ gen .
&quot; in carrying out their inspections , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of its securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , anticipate how they are determined and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , or otherwise from the core material and stock levels removed ; &quot;
( B ) the assessment of the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
( e ) Proced@@ ure for the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which for each material balance zone consisted of the core material and the changes of this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to refund reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures after this convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium material which has not yet reached the stage of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c , shares the organisation of the organization the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) relies on core material that is suitable for the production and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The provisions stipul@@ ated in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not reasonably possible or desirable , the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , insofar as the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , if the entire amount of material liberated in the states at no time is no longer than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alli@@ ble material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this agreement , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community is meeting with the Organization of supple@@ mental agreements , which are required for the successful and effective establishment of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures prescribed in the Convention . &quot;
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or changed without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organisation , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report , the organization continues to carry on the securing measures underlying this Convention in the States , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the following reports and results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organization ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resor@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) The objective of the EEC and Member States is to bind the entire contribution made by the Member States within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the Organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special response account &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special account ; this account is referred to as &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; by the organization , and in accordance with the provisions set out in this agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special account is guided separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or in@@ significant notes of the member state , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organization as the administrator of the special account and to be deposited in the country in question . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment shall be carried out in two inst@@ al@@ ments , and i ) the first amounting to at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every Member State may wish to make payments before the aforementioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker assumes approximately proportional acts on the cash or the school@@ j@@ eine in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further loan capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ advantageous ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered to be considered to be the loan program of the organization , irrespective of whether it is considered to be the loan program of the organization , which is considered to be the target of the Ad@@ ditional Terms to this Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which have already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special promotions are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions , which are generally valid for the organization granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years each . &quot;
&quot; one or more currencies of the Member States are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts due to payment of this dental clock are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
&quot; each special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the funds . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services , which are made or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and which , according to what the car@@ et@@ ter has determined at the time of loan granted , could be recipient of a special offer of action . &quot;
the capital re@@ payments of a special transaction are based on the special response account and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be returned by the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
&quot; until complete awar@@ ding of all the promotions , the administrators are informed about the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the Administrator informed the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the manager sends a detailed account of the special account statement as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization with a statement by the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible sends a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker produces and performs appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special account , resulting from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent . &quot;
the EEC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrators through to the complete issue of the means of special action , run an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special actions , and on all other matters relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the entire capital amount returned by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and ref@@ unded to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the conclusion of the proceedings concerning the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organisation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two manuscripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
considering that the agreement in the form of a correspondence for the amendment of the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is en@@ acted - HA@@ T en@@ acted :
between the European Atom@@ ic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN atomic community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation will be transferred to a common company under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Joint Venture J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is very familiar with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; since up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contractual parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their relevant efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research that has gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contracting party to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and , accordingly , the common goal of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , to achieve faster . &quot;
&quot; to reach the objective of the present agreement , the contractual parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Swiss Programme &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme is taking over long @-@ term goals and the forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme and the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , which includes new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contracting parties accept a new programme , this will apply to the programs listed in An@@ nex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association , provided in paragraph 1 , is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties involved in the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of staff under the concerned laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the aim of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association agreement provided in Article 2 , the contractual parties are called an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , herein@@ after &quot; Associ@@ ated Institu@@ tions , &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after &quot; Agreement on Human Resources Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the joint enterprise J@@ ET at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract , whose objective is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , except for association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which have been appointed by the association in Article 2 , of the present agreement , are described in article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , to set up a steering committee , to the competent representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federation . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by no more than two delegates in the connection group established within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , takes this task in respect of all research and development activities related to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes co @-@ operation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * force in the interest of both contracting parties to the common objective established in the Eur@@ atom programme and in Article 1 of the present agreement , with which the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups set up as part of the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the advisory groups , which provide the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in respect of all research and development work on which it is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the Board of Directors , who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and is responsible for the fact that the capacities of the laboratories involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme are optimally used . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordination committees set up within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which provide appropriate proposals for the best possible use of resources , personnel and knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in respect of all the research and development work involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a member of the core and energy research of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and each associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the program and the possible changes in the facilities as well as in the preparation of the future programs and the establishment of its overall volume , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the comments of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Direc@@ torate of Directors , the Advisory Group , and the coordin@@ ating committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the VG Opinion on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee &apos;s committee in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contractual parties work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies to be created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution in accordance with this agreement is determined annually on an amount that is deb@@ ated by Eur@@ atom on the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as Switzerland &apos;s gross domestic product for the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
&quot; concerning the project J@@ ET , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Joint Business as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland transfers an amount to J@@ ET to the common company J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Firm . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides to finance the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis that normally serves to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to the financing of the works , which are carried out on the basis of the respective contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount to cover the expenditure within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the respective year . &quot;
the Federal Council shall pay the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the remaining payment arrangements for Switzerland and Eur@@ atom &apos;s financial contributions in accordance with this article are set in An@@ nex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to enable Eur@@ atom to be exemp@@ t from the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or goods acquired in this country may not be sold or free of charge in this country , unless approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these deliver@@ ances are not applicable to resting he@@ wers and bodies that are paid to these persons .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge provided for the association agreed in Article 2 , Section 1 of the present agreement are regulated in Article 14 and 15 of this agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on personnel exchange . &quot;
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge , which apply to the Swiss joint company J@@ ET , are governed by Article 14 of this Agreement and in the Stat@@ utes of the Common Firm . &quot;
the right of any contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an integral part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel under the laboratories involved in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;
&quot; - adequate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries in the allocation of orders for the implementation of the two associated programmes according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts used . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and in the associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , will justify the access to this knowledge under the same conditions as Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge gained in the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and associated third countries , as well as individuals or companies who are operating in a member state of Eur@@ atom or associated third @-@ country research or production activities that justify access to this knowledge . &quot;
&quot; the contractual parties share this knowledge of other states , persons or companies only if the agreement is made between the parties , unless these individuals or companies operate in Switzerland &apos;s research or production activities that justify access to this knowledge . &quot;
&quot; if patents protected under number 1 and 2 of this article are protected by patents , these patents can be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated Third States and the persons or enterprises located in the countries concerned for research purposes in pursuit of the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated Third States and individuals or companies based in the concerned countries may be granted licenses or sub @-@ licenses for the use of these patents for industrial or commercial purposes , insofar as the parties are authorised to grant such licenses or sub@@ licenses . &quot;
&quot; the knowledge that has resulted from the activities of Eur@@ atom , the associated organs and Switzerland prior to the entry into force of this agreement will be made available to those states , persons or companies that may be notified in section 1 and 2 , insofar as this is necessary for the use of the knowledge described in these numbers . &quot;
&quot; patents which come from the activities referred to in this section will be provided to those States , persons or companies that may receive a license or sub@@ license to the patents mentioned in paragraph 3 of this Article insofar as this is required for the use of these licenses or sub@@ licenses . &quot;
the rights to the invent@@ ors or their legal success@@ ors according to the respective national law are not affected by this article .
the Parties shall refrain from any action that could imp@@ air the pat@@ ent@@ ability of inventions arising from the activities mentioned in the paragra@@ phs 1 and 2 of this article .
&quot; a mixed shot is used with the designation &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom / Switzerland &quot; , &quot; the representative of the commission and representatives of the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;

&quot; the BI@@ S could conclude Stand@@ by loan agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries , if the banks provide a corresponding request . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; even now , however , some conditions are listed below which the BI@@ S would be ready to use . &quot;
&quot; for each Stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans as well as with the extension of any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws are not made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement at the available currencies , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take account of the funds of the bank , probably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who address the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market sets . &quot;
&quot; if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary means , however , the interest in the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the margin raised by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

&quot; in view of the fact that Article 27 of the Convention concerning changes has not yet entered into force , - I &quot;
1 . comply with the provisions of Article 1 paragraph 2 b ) of the Convention ;
2 . realize that the postpon@@ ement of the application for the application of this Convention for five years in accordance with Article 21 ( 1 ) in practice for some developing countries may be insufficient .
&quot; in such cases , a developing country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before exp@@ ir@@ ation of the deadline stated in Article 21 ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 . realize that developing countries , which are currently implementing customs value determination on the basis of officially established minimum values , want to make a reservation , in order to maintain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions to which the contractual parties agree to retain ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . realize that developing countries , who are of the opinion , can cause actual difficulties to reverse order of application in accordance with article 4 , which can have the desire to make the following reservation to Article 4 : &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat from Argentina in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat , I grant myself to refer to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following yearly amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaugh@@ ter@@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure through appropriate procedures that the quantity of the yearly quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and / is performed in accordance with conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the supply form should be made possible due to changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned below 10 , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community claims the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to bear in mind that the access of Argentina , which is regulated by this agreement , is not affected by the Community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ stroke of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the number 2 determined by number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the regulations of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which will be invo@@ iced to the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total quantity mentioned below number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community on 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ n@@ age weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community encounters precau@@ tions in order to prevent the shipments of inter@@ ven@@ tional states of frozen meat as a result of the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance to the Par@@ agra@@ ph of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only at prices and conditions that are in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are interpreted in a manner compatible with articles XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the general customs and trade agreements . &quot;
&quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions in order to make the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products originating from the submission of an export license issued by the authorities designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in terms of implementation , it is also stipul@@ ated that the competent authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals provides the quantities to be issued for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed in accordance with destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency to the hammer - , lamb - and goat &apos;s market for both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of importance for that under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will not be carried out under the agreement called collective bar@@ gaining numbers under the agreement . &quot;
the Committee discusses any questions arising in the execution of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount stated by the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount and bears the seasonal nature of the trade bill .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 , with regard to changes which they consider necessary for the necessary consideration . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure through appropriate procedures that the quantity of the yearly quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the Community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ stroke of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the number 2 determined by number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;

I honor you to share the consent of my government with the content of your letter .
&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor to take on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations for the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the Regulation on a common market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that the normal he@@ el of the New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on these markets is not affected , I honor to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;

&quot; binding wording of this Protocol , whose English , French and Russian wording is equally binding , will be deposited with the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; containers and in@@ fusion devices must be labeled with a label in English and French , which corresponds to the samples contained in the plants 2 @-@ 10 to this protocol . &quot;
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred must be sent only in vessels where the temperature can be kept up to 4 C to 6 C during transport .
&quot; the preparations and devices mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ rogen and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the consi@@ gn@@ ments to the equipment required for in@@ fusion , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot;
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is the blood taken out of a healthy person and mixed with a suitable anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) which cannot be freely transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured through simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood removal occurs as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle by a sealed , sterile tube system in which the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution was in@@ filtr@@ ated before steri@@ li@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; after termination of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is immediately to be closed and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C. After that , it must be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant solution must not be more than 220 ml per liter of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration must not stop 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 @-@ System must first be determined by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; if there are standardized or recommended methods for blood @-@ group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific studies have yiel@@ ded the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , you and E . &quot;
the blood changed after this agreement should only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is protected against micro @-@ organisms in the sterile , closed bottle , and up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during the time required for testing and transport , which can only be 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood is to cool down again to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the greatest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
it contains all the red blood cells of the unit from which it has been extracted ; other blood cell components can be present or can be partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution , which was added to the removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ it ) should be indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the removal must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; if an artificial wat@@ ered solution has been added , the label also states its volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human drying plasma is extracted by drying out of the liquid , which sett@@ les at centri@@ fu@@ gal or sedi@@ mentation of human solid . &quot;
the human drying plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method through which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the quantity of liquid produced in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 grams per litre , and the solution must not have visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations where ( using a fresh serum sample ) a dangerous content of I@@ sole @-@ ys@@ in or immune atro@@ phy has been established are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood sample , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of transmission of ir@@ cul@@ ation hepatitis , mixtures of the plasma are to be taken that contain no more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods that are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the quantity of liquid produced in the production of plasma is to add corresponding amount of water , the substance must be completely detached from 15 to 20 C within 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the quantity of fluid from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; in 1 ml solution , a sufficient amount of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de is made ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 ° C. &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ level drying process in the presence of phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of at most 0.@@ 02 mm mercury , weight loss above 0.5 % may not occur in the human dry plasma . &quot;
&quot; human dry @-@ plasma is in a nitrogen atmosphere or in the air @-@ empty space in a sterile , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and , if possible , to store any moisture ; it is to be protected from light and kept at a temperature below 20 C. &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and frac@@ tions of human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component , consisting of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma of the human body . &quot;
&quot; without regard to whether the end product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must have been heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C for the addition of a suitable stabili@@ zer in the final container for 10 hours in the final container in order to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of i@@ pos@@ culp@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in preparations of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is freeze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the Group is made from human plasma proteins as a solution , it must exhibit a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 grams per litre . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per litre . &quot;
comparative measurements of the viscosity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis which are made before and after heating to the solutions must not result in any sign of a den@@ atur@@ ation of the dissolved proteins .
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six degrees of shaking in a mechanical vibr@@ ating unit at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood @-@ group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ cker is measured by always di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to double in a suitable medium .
the Tit@@ er is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely on the volume of the blood cell flow in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object bear@@ ers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination , International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at the time . &quot;
&quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ s is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ters , which is observed in a series of th@@ inners with ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te de@@ fl@@ ation . &quot;
the ti@@ pper gives the re@@ agent di@@ lution in the final mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as incomplete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the titanium ration of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be preserved for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form , according to the label , lies at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of durability tests ; it is to be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent government authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with dry re@@ agents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent continues to fu@@ ell@@ ate the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of frozen or re@@ dissolved serum .
&quot; the re@@ agents , whether in a fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or any visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored as far as possible for the international exchange , at least as long as there is no international agreement on a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination are to be distributed in such a manner and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity that is located in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written written records about all stages and controls of the re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination .
&quot; appropriate samples of all the re@@ agents issued are to be stored for such a long time from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container , a black on white printed label is to be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; in no event , the effectiveness of the serum must not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot;
non @-@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily identifiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % F@@ loo@@ ds from A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempts are performed with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard preparation of the same activity . &quot;
&quot; in addition , anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) is mixed to an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard prepar@@ atory of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % fl@@ ushing of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity may belong to one of two types which are distinguished by the conditions under which ag@@ glut@@ ination is reached hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .

&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen , the serum should react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is determined to use object bear@@ ers according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons who are immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with in@@ undation of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen if the tested blood cells are infl@@ ated in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the Tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .

protocol to the 1979 agreement on large @-@ scale gre@@ ener air pollution control regarding the fight against nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ zu@@ eber@@ schrei@@ flow
&quot; concern that the current emissions of air @-@ poll@@ uting substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural value of vital importance for the environment and economy , &quot;
&quot; remember that the executive body has recognized the need for the Convention on its second meeting , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , maintaining and checking emissions limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and impacts of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their consequ@@ ent products on the environment as well as data about technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ adi@@ ene river , particularly by applying suitable national emission limits for new mobile larger site sources as well as retro@@ fitting existing larger site sources , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that scientific and technical knowledge is further developed over these issues , and that this development must be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that the development of a solution based on critical loads involves creating an effective scientific basis towards the goal , which is to be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further internationally agreed measures , &quot;
