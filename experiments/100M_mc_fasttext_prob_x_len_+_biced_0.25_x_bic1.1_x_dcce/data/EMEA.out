&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Investment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the CH@@ MP Committee has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package enclosed ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where patients alternate with man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ setting ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid monitoring of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or using the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; for patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are taken at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably primarily a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with cervi@@ cal dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment has been studied . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the processed tablets and the solution to take ( assimil@@ ate ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater distur@@ b@@ ance than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( nausea ) , swelling ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , swelling ( nausea ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety disorders . &quot;
the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were predomin@@ ant compared to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , exceeded the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the takeover of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and discussed their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy appear signs and symptoms of late dy@@ nas@@ al an@@ esth@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients suffering from sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , resp@@ . an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weighed for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; this drug may not be used in pregnancy as a result of the insufficient data base for man and because of the concerns inherent in the reproductive studies of animals , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole received a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) from EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with semi @-@ surgical do@@ cking was observed . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment was observed . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo was evaluated .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms associated with anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed with adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ ergi@@ c gen and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and on put@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms statisti@@ cally significant compared to placebo . &quot;
in a Hal@@ operated dol @-@ controlled trial 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who had attached a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and semi @-@ operative dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values derived from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed a significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ operated dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary target target &apos; weight gain &apos; was increased by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an adverse effect compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study , over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a systemic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an adverse effect comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ surgical dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia on like lithium or semi @-@ operative dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole yiel@@ ded superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ isation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l at extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at almost 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients . &quot;
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study of patients with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans based on the conventional studies on safety scar@@ mak@@ ology , re@@ produc@@ tion@@ sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the potential carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss in rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole estimated at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .

&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can use the melting tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary target target &apos; weight gain &apos; was increased by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared in tablet form for healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 Fur@@ ther a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid detachment of detachment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase resor@@ ption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by thi@@ pping adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking account of the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy processed tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with suscep@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ eri@@ ac and malign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ gregation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which the healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) were used as one @-@ time in@@ tra @-@ muscular one , and the simultaneously lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) was intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 metabol@@ ises the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot;
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received the intensity of se@@ duction greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole after all .
&quot; the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials involving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) : &quot;
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment was observed . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo was evaluated .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms associated with anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of as@@ gi@@ dity / behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances compared to placebo and was similar to cervi@@ cal dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as ag@@ gra@@ zing and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in symptoms with respect to as@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the average improvement observed from the starting value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ gi@@ dity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance of Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot;
in a Hal@@ operated dol @-@ controlled trial 52 the share of respon@@ der patients who had attached a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and semi @-@ operative dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values derived from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly greater improvement than at Hal@@ operated dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary target target &apos; weight gain &apos; was increased by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 6 weeks with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , compared with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time was applied until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target body after repeated administration during a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was in 15@@ - and 5 @-@ times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety mak@@ eup , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not recognize any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose of humans and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss in rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the moderate steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel alone . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference in efficacy indicators such as time until the worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel alone . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ ene numbers in the blood prior to the start of the treatment .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with the first treatment to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel alone and that it has not to be given to other drugs in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane across the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment of metastatic disease and is not shown for the treatment of a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted , until a recovery is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with impaired ren@@ al function were carried out and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other forms of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in the patients , no further abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phy number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in the indicated patient population is not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ ques and con@@ stit@@ uting means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after the treatment , no child is to witness . &quot;
male patients should be advised of treatment via a sperm contrac@@ eption since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can impact on the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important occur@@ ren@@ ces of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in table 1 , the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy have occurred at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart diseases : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burn , dry mouth , loose stool , ede@@ ma , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pains , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , abdominal pain , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , f@@ ain@@ ting pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness , Very frequent : &quot;
ru@@ th@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al relationship established with these events . &quot;
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is an An@@ tim@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules compound that promotes the merging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ m@@ ts and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ send@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bic protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine occurs a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ armed non @-@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , either in form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ sives 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a bad general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ ases and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity over pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were measured in clinical studies .
&quot; the active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; 10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration took off in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel in intraven@@ ous 30 minutes were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
the pac@@ lit@@ axel range was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) as a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ phones and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data is available for patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was protected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ light light over 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the holder of permission to market prior to market launch provides medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Study brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging support . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also known as &quot; reference medication &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood lip@@ id values , which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complic@@ ation , if a blood @-@ blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1 800 ml . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients must be controlled prior to the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers it to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was treated as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients , who suffered from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , with the reference drug agent . &quot;
&quot; for at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , spec@@ ulated by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed a rise of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling , mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the drug has demonstrated a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; the company that produces se@@ amed , will provide information packages to the medical staff in all Member States including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , in case blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of a large volume of blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults with no iron deficiency in adults , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and pregnancy may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the doctor &apos;s assessment of the patient &apos;s clinical progression and disease condition is required . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent occur@@ ren@@ ces may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical history and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required to check the an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ trac@@ ts by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the recur@@ ve number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l above the output value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ ve number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the recur@@ ve number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required should be received in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
&quot; as early as possible , the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that great iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed @-@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this connection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each for 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into the circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ plac@@ sia and PR@@ CA ) should not receive any ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , companion or gra@@ ft diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , vascular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) has rarely been reported on the appearance of a medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the recur@@ rence value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ compliance ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ escence , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; index &quot; &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( i.e. the &quot; index &quot; &quot; index &quot; &quot; ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of a loss of effect is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations under Section 4.2 . &quot;
in clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ic @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ine if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration needed for control of the an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentrations under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in the case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin should be taken into account ( patients who have to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the h@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking part in the patient &apos;s specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially at an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an increased risk of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ cer@@ tained . &quot;
&quot; used epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa along with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and adjusted to the growing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
in vitro studies in tumour tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
&quot; about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ em@@ ic , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , vascular thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical treatment with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ genic , and in relation to the amino acid and carbohydr@@ ate content , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ emia patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 further hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ ome , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
&quot; in these studies , the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an an@@ a@@ emia consistent with an an@@ a@@ emia due to different malign@@ ancies , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and at inspections .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa conditions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 in animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ em body weight , to a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in the fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are however of uncertain Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z for the clinical situation . &quot;

&quot; • within one month before your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time , or increased chest pain ) , the risk of a blood drop in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - if for example , such a drop of blood has occurred in the past , for example . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of blood counts , which can be traced back to further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to monitor the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; iron deficiency , loss of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before starting the treatment with se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti@@ corpor@@ eal ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ie , it will break your therapy with dis@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value should be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor can take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present knowledge , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly in order to minimize the risk of blood crop formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared with the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past already thro@@ m@@ botanical vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that check @-@ out is like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if there is a greater orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your red blood dy@@ e values ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get rid amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood ar@@ m@@ wood ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to check the success rate and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .

&quot; to ensure this and to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the treating doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the operation . &quot;

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • O@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which causes the bones to be br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic oc@@ rup@@ ture such as h@@ inf@@ estation ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the disease , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for the evaluation of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis more than 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was , whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without any other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s side @-@ effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredient .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides information for doctors to prescri@@ be the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains advice on how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the transport of A@@ cla@@ sta across the European Union . &quot;

intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium twice a day in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 as data is missing for safety and efficacy .
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended since only limited clinical experience exists for these patients . &quot;
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta before the beginning of therapy with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone remo@@ del@@ ing , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium twice a day in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental treatment , no data is available , whether the break of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious side effects was increased in patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the O@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated with decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years between the cla@@ im@@ ant and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the disease @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the disease Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ ine area was reported , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ing . &quot;
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients came up with o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis in the jaw area in one with A@@ cla@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo .
&quot; in the event of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or medium @-@ heavy existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the th@@ rot@@ tle by 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , were taken from the pel@@ vic crest after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es . &quot;
a micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cla@@ sta in comparison to placebo an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study hours .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cla@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dosage of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment by BM@@ D at all times .
&quot; over 24 months , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total th@@ igh and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta in comparison with the once weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cla@@ sta was examined in patients over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all mild to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ x up to 3,@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the starting value for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients enrolled at the end of the six @-@ month trial as respon@@ der ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response from 143 to A@@ cla@@ sta , compared with 71 treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be maintained in the mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early part phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolic @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) cor@@ related with the cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ ine clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance down to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) contains only limited data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal dose of single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
&quot; in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to the 6@@ x of human therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C ) in 3 @-@ day intervals , in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7 @-@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which have sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ resor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
in rats a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity of doses above 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , Pharmaceu@@ tical Co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The holder of authorization for the market ent@@ ails the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance which are presented in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the application of authorisation and of all the following versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human drug products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current information on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk in@@ im@@ itation ) has been achieved . • On request of the E@@ MEA . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens . &quot;
&quot; declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; the bone remo@@ del@@ ing takes place at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by re @-@ norm@@ alizing the bone remo@@ ver , ensuring a normal bone formation and gives the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs from which they are damaging the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and drink , you are concerned that you take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to take A@@ cla@@ sta administration two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low after in@@ fusion .
&quot; for Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before completing the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering ending treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please see your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are advised to take the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid introduction of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone remo@@ del@@ ing , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package enclosed ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over it , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I &quot;
&quot; in addition , there were four studies on more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting the smoking . &quot;

&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he noted the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may strengthen the risk of depression and can cause suicide in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

&quot; after 2 years the difference in the total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 6 months -@@ 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 &quot;
the percentage of patients reaching a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . LN &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z

&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on the fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

&quot; abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Investment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the CH@@ MP Committee has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) that cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ f@@ onic resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of acet@@ one treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , so type 2 diabetes can be set better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in doing so , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ onic resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos has led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been lowered when applying dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ onic res@@ ins showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin reported a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor can patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ tos across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the markings &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( f.@@ e. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease has been carried out .
&quot; this study showed an increase in the incidence of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are available .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven which can be driven by fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in similar controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative decrease of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.1 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral tw@@ o- or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ on , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , about a occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes for a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment should be suspended ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies of interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on decreases the insulin @-@ induced hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege on three @-@ fold of the upper limit of the norm range , however , often occurred as in placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular illness the frequency of severe heart failure was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one respectively .
&quot; since the market launch , it has rarely been reported on heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with more than 7.@@ 400 patients in the treated groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on appears to work on activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose evaluation in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time to leave the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase , were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared with the patients who continued to receive only insulin ; a reduction of the insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel and a marginal , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduced the total plas@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was detected under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while in met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide , values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ den@@ al hei@@ gh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previous advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma are normally reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies it could be proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral use of radio@@ actively defined pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys matches with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on decreases the hyper@@ insulin @-@ insulin and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for red@@ dening growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat induced increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased frequency of colon@@ os@@ por@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the markings &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials more than 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the hum@@ idi@@ ties tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial hei@@ gh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , which has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study concluded the aim with regard to their primary end@@ point , which a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the markings &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients received with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and received from over 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial hei@@ gh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
in the study after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level , indicating that blood sugar levels have been lowered similarly to other human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is found in the package enclosed ) . &quot;
the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ weighed the risks .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to author@@ ise Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can detect the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , this may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or compared with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which will pass over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the physician must consider possible interactions during therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines used by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 . both hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit death in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Peri@@ ph@@ ere Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood glucose control can be associated with discomfort which are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally rever@@ sible .
5 A intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of the blood sugar adjustment may however be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the under@@ carriage of validity - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can arise when failed to change the placement within the injection area .
&quot; current hyper@@ sensitivity reactions during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system schol@@ arly - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may develop gradually : • Easy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice with them . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a one @-@ weight help person or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split are active .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety mak@@ eup , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow for any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is taken from the fridge - the temperature of the insulin to be increased at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it becomes res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for use .
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or compared with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the physician must consider possible interactions during therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines used by them . &quot;

follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle above • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
&quot; if air bubbles are present , they will hold up in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge - While you continue to keep up the injection needle , turn the cartridge in the direction of the arrow ( Figure D ) • Dur@@ ing the injection needle , you press the push button in the direction of the arrow ( figure D ) • Now you have to remove a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle . &quot;
&quot; • Set the end cap again so on the ready pen , that the number 0 is compared to the metering brand ( figure E ) • Check if the button is pressed completely . &quot;
&quot; if not , turn the cap until the button is pressed completely • Ke@@ ep your ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let horizont@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; when the push button is not able to move outside , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the closing cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the button is 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the number on the cap directly next to the metering brand • Ad@@ ding the highest number you can see on the pressure button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the given dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the end cap simply forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , insulin will leak from the injection needle and the given dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , perform the following steps : &quot;
then remove the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the dosing token is opposite .
make sure to press the pressure button only during the injection . • Ke@@ ep the pressure button pressed completely after the injection until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin .
&quot; if not , turn the lid until the button is pressed completely and then proceed as described in before use • Can you hear a cli@@ cking sound when pressing the pressure button . &quot;
it may be in@@ accurate • You cannot adjust a dose which is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining volume scale to estimate how much insulin is left .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any other component .
&quot; in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to author@@ ise Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id for the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the fast acting insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 In case of switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient a dose adjustment is required , this may be necessary at the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which will pass over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and complaints at the location Gel@@ eg@@ atively - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions during the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of action is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and teen@@ ager ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data are limited , but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of de@@ cel@@ eration , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger urine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there are still a number of cases . therefore , it is recommended that patients take at least six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic at least during the first six months of treatment . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were in the blood at the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg taken , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was at 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo of the case . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary acid level in the blood as al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including a toxic@@ ity known or currently available from the patient &apos;s history and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the serum har@@ row seal is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe ren@@ al function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing medicinal products , it can occur during the treatment &apos;s beginning to acute g@@ out , because by reducing serum har@@ n@@ acid acid , ur@@ inary acid deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syn@@ drome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that there is a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical findings and a liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not perform interaction studies at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study conducted with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which points to a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ du@@ ms containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease of the C@@ MA@@ x caused by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , machines or in exercising hazardous activities , until they can be reasonably safe that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the exam@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) was observed although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term renewal studies have been treated to 9@@ 06 patients for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the data according to occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these cans or with a lower frequency :

ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism and arises as part of the reaction sk@@ as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with whom the last three month specific serum har@@ n@@ ering levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum incre@@ ment &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg . &quot;
the lowering of serum resin levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the serum acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum har@@ n@@ aci@@ dity concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients required a reduction in the incidence of serum har@@ dening ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a g@@ ou@@ ting ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the toxic@@ ity size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the plaster no@@ des up to month 24 . &quot;
elevated T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ en , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed mainly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly generated by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean overall AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ y in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ y in the group with severe kidney end@@ ys@@ function .
12 Li@@ ver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moder@@ ately ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver function restriction did not change the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in terms of the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , fertility of fertility In case of male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tumours ( intermediate cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ oma ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the high @-@ dose treated group , at about the 11 @-@ fold exposure of humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and are not considered relevant for clinical application .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were approximately the 4.3 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by a reduction in performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 4.3 times and with lifting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or assimil@@ ating other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data derived from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to prove AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE &apos;s efficacy with regard to increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also submitted data to suggest that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same as that for preventing bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( blo@@ gging ) , triggered abdom@@ en ( blo@@ oming abdom@@ en ) as well as acid bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other component , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only used with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swal@@ lowed after exposure of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cut the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ ts , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract besides p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore atten@@ tively pay attention to all signs and symptoms , which indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the presence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn , and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of serious malign@@ ant side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men predominantly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
there are no data available that give indications whether setting a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure to reduce the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient on the basis of an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients need to be instructed when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned at the intended day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before starting the therapy .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither administered during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that determine embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al evolution .
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , but also in o@@ steopor@@ osis cases . &quot;
&quot; however , absorption of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at of an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to vitamin D@@ 3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate and regulate serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a shortage of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures of o@@ steopor@@ otic persons . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years amounted to 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction was achieved in comparison with the placebo group ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to retain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur @-@ neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two pla@@ z@@ ebo@@ at studies , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily more than 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal cord by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fast and two hours before acceptance of a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ otic studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; nine distribution studies have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es . &quot;
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
&quot; in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bones , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , patients with reduced kidney function can expect a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients , in which the transplan@@ t was abor@@ ted after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , temporary further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been carried out and investigated , such as adv@@ agra@@ ph in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft , absorbed by the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other ingredient , advance agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines have to be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f as the prescribed dose or dose of the same medication may have to be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; hard @-@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ated yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should re@@ arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clinical relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should be carried out only under close control of a medical device experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic medicine monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirror should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a mirror , was comparable to both ni@@ er and le@@ ber@@ transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the lawyer can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; for the duration of the application to supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , must be carried out . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; in the case of adult patients being switched to adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken every day . &quot;
&quot; in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , other transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage Adju@@ st@@ ments in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function for maintaining blood levels in the desired area may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potentials of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum carcin@@ oma , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ port to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ port to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case under the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ro@@ li@@ mus controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood flow levels should also be controlled after change@@ over from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time applying substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , it can take several days to adjust the dose until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of the level in the blood exceeds 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in cases of 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml for patients with heart transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection , or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should be carried out only under close control of a medical device experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which was proven to be treated with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation , Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts in childhood no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation .
&quot; because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level under such circumstances can be subject to considerable fluctuations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy could be observed as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid exposure and o@@ ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ert , lac@@ tose are included in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicinal products or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level at the same time , of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to the maintenance of the same level ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly result from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is especially cau@@ tious when decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are taken . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduces the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
&quot; the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the by @-@ effects of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the adverse events ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases Like as known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus often increase suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
it has been reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high attachment to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular inn@@ s . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymph@@ oma ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; patient survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were killed . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or lack of follow @-@ up@@ - data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) occurred . &quot;
&quot; published results of the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in form of twice daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 @-@ examined patients , with 4@@ 75 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and used in 6@@ 30 cases after a colon transplan@@ t as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; also a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome , was to be observed less frequently in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in comparison to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) greater ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
&quot; in one study , the frequency of the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was followed up to reach the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; colon transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , which lead to tal@@ k@@ ative exposure between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently gra@@ ft ir@@ radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or an increase in metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile . &quot;
&quot; in the case of stable patients who were converted from pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower under Pro@@ gra@@ f ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dor@@ sal level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;

lawyer is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether an advance is applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers them to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
&quot; lawyer is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under 6 years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of lawyers in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood samples with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; was evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; lawyers may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any other ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the transport of lawyers across the European Union . &quot;
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment process , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not achieved , or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the speed of the administration should be directed according to the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ axial activity of factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da as@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tr@@ s ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VI@@ II is no experience during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) which show a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated by the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with a difficult to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , no 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with age of less than 6 years and a difficult to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were diagnosed with a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or ( ≥ 50 days ) after previous exposure to a factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
previously untreated patients of a current clinical trial were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients there were reports about the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es of gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As for other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial authorisation , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk assessment , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for the Promotion of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; usually , however , the breast , brain , bones or soft parts ( tissues which connect and support other structures in the body are affected ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , thus allowing the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , formed by the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to restoring damaged DNA and killing the cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the area of the under@@ belly , in bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to his questions , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP on Tag 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors benefits for the patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ancements can be made in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified drug release &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other , slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who had pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who were deprived of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart @-@ hun@@ ts ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any other ingredient , adren@@ ergi@@ c or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients with hyper@@ tension ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ roid ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( caused by cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) , or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed in the whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued following the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease over time with long @-@ term care . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if required . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity of combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , per@@ or@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tive drugs ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient , and the data is not sufficient to give appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ ae were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data are not sufficient to make appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that treating a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; as part of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether a dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , however , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies does not result in increasing the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised that in very rare cases , it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can result in impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , ag@@ itated Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breath in@@ suffici@@ ency , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disorders , and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigi@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the suspension of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion promot@@ er P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients between the ages of 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub@@ groups according to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ inal application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , does not reveal any particular dangers for human beings based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , Pharmaceu@@ tical Co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur with you under the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders , nausea and head@@ aches , or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you take aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken over , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
&quot; use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected , that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or reduces attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the time appointed . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash cases . &quot;
&quot; about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart @-@ hun@@ ts , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach pain , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sor@@ eness , sleep disorders , disorders of liver inflammation , cases of liver inflammation and about cases of eye @-@ catching liver values have also very rarely been reported . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg @-@ processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for insertion . &quot;
&quot; for children in the age of one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or other . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies on seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by identifying the changes in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ling , decrease of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to verify that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the processed tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom @-@ scores ( symptom point number ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , a decrease in symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 % and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; ap@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any other ingredient . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the European Commission for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous course of disease and can be stopped after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed .
in the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised that it can occur in very rare cases , that can result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily , as in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently encountered adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes the suspension of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion promot@@ er P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the total of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the ae@@ ti@@ ology in the various forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easier pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ am@@ ine composition is a caus@@ ative factor in all primitive diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is also leading to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal aller@@ genic Rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a single dose study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety mak@@ eup , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not allow any particular dangers to the human being . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ap@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher levels of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with ap@@ eri@@ us , compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children between 1 and 11 years of age who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ ate dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; since the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single day dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and juven@@ ile patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused Rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ern ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study involving sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
the loading ( AU@@ C ) caused by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ cing bottles with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for use with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for inhal@@ ing once daily in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the ly@@ ophi@@ le dose should be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily , compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study used up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical trials , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo .
&quot; with a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard met@@ rics including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal aller@@ genic Rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

an A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablet once daily in the mouth to relieve the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put into the mouth , to relieve the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the processed tablet must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets have not been proven in the treatment of children under 6 years of age .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile detected in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets were used as bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the classification of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically &quot;
&quot; with an adult dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg has no influence on standard met@@ rics including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients , however , was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for inclusion were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , however , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dose in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years is the same as those in children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events , more commonly reported than placebo , were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution was observed not to detect any side effects in patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population were comparable . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively alternatively be allergic to rh@@ initi@@ s or inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us provides the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio @-@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in various single dose studies , the recommended doses of AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced that the company res@@ umes its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine designed to protect against a trunk of the flu virus which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new trunk of the influenza virus appears , which can easily spread from humans to humans because people have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system detects the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to form an antibody fast in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognizes as a bodily alien ) , cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , because the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs of the patient before , and the probability has judged that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice a day 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; for children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase is directed to the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , ag@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not a cure , but it can also delay the damage to the immune system and also the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers . &quot;
the drug a@@ gener@@ ase increased with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to be prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers , the medicines enhanced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r came to a stronger rub@@ b@@ ish of the viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors further : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of a@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any other constitu@@ ent .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients , the car@@ ob ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just as as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers exceeded the risks over four years .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was originally allowed under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the marketing of as@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , Prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of a@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily are reduced . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth , and also present substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant technical information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with impaired liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of car@@ dio @-@ s@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is fed with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be supervised on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase Solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an ex@@ cre@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases in which medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
H@@ amm@@ o patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ators are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis .
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic breadth and also represent substrates of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Sub@@ strate with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in attempting to compensate the low plasma levels of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient has already taken St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ mirrors and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % lower when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily by the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed using A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ dium component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
&quot; treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low . &quot;
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is recommended since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , among them substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially interact with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase , as it may result in resor@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduction of the plasma gas seal of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen them with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test persons , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma seal increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases of the plasma level at the same time are expected by A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to my@@ opathy including a ro@@ o@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be increased at the same time by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while caution is required while applying a@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fa@@ che .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be supervised on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adjust the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ ye dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , at the same time of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic action ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional dosage of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and adverse effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ p@@ pling into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in po@@ sterity . &quot;
the further development of the descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the safety of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were mild to moderate , mat@@ ured early and rarely led to a break in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking a@@ gener@@ ase or any other drug used at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients as well as laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals , who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stick coatings ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients performed under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mal@@ ign nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be abor@@ ted with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported in particular to patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of a@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to see signs of in@@ toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gene and ga@@ g @-@ poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ gs with the result of a formation of un@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both at acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral , previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described were rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r received twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , occurred a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors un@@ treated , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to assess the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / C / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / G , I@@ 5@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , they can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for assessing the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret results of resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for the cross resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossil pren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ances , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , appear ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and zo@@ di@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early demo@@ lition of a failing therapy is recommended in order to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; the receipt of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( N@@ R@@ TI twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly covered with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ sub@@ mis@@ sibility of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ threshold threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the receipt of the effectiveness of un@@ fired as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , aspir@@ ation solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients receiving PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the benefits of &quot; un@@ attended &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; hence the minimum concentration at the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ yiel@@ ded am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available from the solution than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of kidney dysfunction should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these chemotherapy regi@@ mens lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ds comparable to those obtained by healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients in clinical trials , neither in the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase , nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated with age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ roid ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be taken with care in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily by the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test persons , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma seal increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , at the same time of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic action ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother , compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ p@@ pling into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in post @-@ income . &quot;
the safety of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to see signs of in@@ toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both at acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the use of PI pre @-@ treated children should be considered as anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; un@@ attended &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ yiel@@ ded am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active ingredient fluctu@@ ates depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney dysfunction will be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated with age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in juven@@ ile the metabolism path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; a gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ers ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over . &quot;
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was neither documented in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to stop the capsules to stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for aspir@@ ation is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , since no dose recommendations can be given for simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of a@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , aspir@@ in solution for small children and children under the age of 4 is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be set permanently , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
H@@ amm@@ o patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tig@@ ators are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors to related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for the person is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ p@@ pling into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in the seed after the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the safety of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking a@@ gener@@ ase or any other drug used at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral , previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described were rarely observed . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease that is to be treated : • With small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks lasting five times a week . &quot;
&quot; before sleeping , the cream is thin layer on the affected areas of the skin to apply , so that they remain on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before they are washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo had been performed daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tumours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % with the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) and leave to leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ine@@ an area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose has been left out , the patient will apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual treatment plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied skin area infected with skin , until the cream is completely absorbed . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , weighing should take place between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , weighing should take place between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stri@@ k@@ tur that was leading to circumc@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatments for the treatment of external intensi@@ ties in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al region , no clinical experience has been found . &quot;
&quot; although limited data indicates an increased rate of recur@@ rence reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the gra@@ dients . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm about the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin actions , a treatment break of several days can be done . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other suitable therapies should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there are no clinical experiences , so the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tumours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
only very limited data are available about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy in intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed less complete healing rates than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies there are no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after several top@@ ically topical application reaches quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation for application can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most commonly shared and most likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in context @-@ related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most frequently reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ ome patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most frequent occurrence as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction at the site of application ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme treated patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; these clinical signs , according to the test plan , show that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies , it often came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ erosion ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; these clinical signs , according to the test plan , show that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe decay formation and sal@@ utation ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental one @-@ off oral recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the fi@@ v@@ eb@@ war@@ ts in an im@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior . &quot;
&quot; in 60 % of the patients who treated I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces completely healed ; this was the case in 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ layer use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; were clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a 4 week treatment period , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ at@@ otic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of pron@@ oun@@ cement , ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally cell carcin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème through the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the estimated half @-@ life period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2@@ h half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study , which indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin . &quot;
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low from 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application for four months was not similar to the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at der@@ mal administration at three days per week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being is considered to be very small due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the hydrogen @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
it may harm other people even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects will affect you significantly or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information information please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; ● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) , is a frequently occurring , slowly growing form of the skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; when it remains untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment are important . &quot;
&quot; ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to much of the solar radiation during their lifetime . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used with flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with skin war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about before you start treatment . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the area to be treated is cured after a previous medi@@ cam@@ ent@@ ous or surgical treatment . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact , remove the cream by rin@@ se with water . o Do not apply more cream than your doctor ordered you . o If reactions occur in the treated area , which will cause you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cancelled , you can continue the treatment . o Inform@@ ate your doctor if they have no normal blood screen &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , swelling of the skin or the skin or difficulty of with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin can be calculated with increased incidence of pre@@ f@@ skin con@@ stric@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ oidal ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as each related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only occur in an appropriate clinical setting , in the re@@ vit@@ alization facility immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , it has to be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ gi@@ ca ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ca and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
&quot; 3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the preceding reaction has occurred . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns being exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients enrolled in the study under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in previous history , severe reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) also occurred . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable Drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it came to a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a severe exp@@ ir@@ ation of the ser@@ o@@ kon@@ ia within a month ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature expul@@ sion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were unable to detect as@@ say ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients , in which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was established . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ al@@ ising inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies in time . &quot;
the reason for enzyme replacement therapy is to restore the enzyme activity to the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated subsi@@ dy and the prevention of further accumulation .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely to be about man@@ ose 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients between 6 and 43 years of age . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the whole disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute @-@ test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
&quot; after 26 weeks of treatment , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to improve lung function in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the percentage FE@@ V to be expected is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the total pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes encomp@@ assed for five efficacy variables ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , which was investigated mainly for the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the middle course form ) . &quot;
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 .
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was established after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium progression @-@ form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the elderly patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation only limited or no progress in cognitive development was determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute audi@@ ting test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , which are available on a yearly basis , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety mak@@ eup , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow for any particular dangers to the human being . &quot;
&quot; since no constitutional studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed below 6.@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , if the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
5 ml concentrate for the production of a solution in bottle ( type I glass ) with stop@@ pers ( silicone chlor@@ ob@@ ut@@ yl rubber ) and sealing ( aluminium ) with tear cap ( poly@@ propylene ) .
10 Pre@@ par@@ ation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of di@@ lution cylinders to be dil@@ uted according to body weight of each patient .
&quot; within the given time , the holder of authorization for the market has to complete the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual review report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will follow long @-@ term security and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase occurred .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take pharmaceuticals that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because a possible risk of dimin@@ ished action of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken over , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for making an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils occurred . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • stomach pain • Skin rash , back pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion point &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , which will be available on a yearly basis , and if necessary , the package fee will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , if the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of di@@ lution cylinders to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( by surgery alone ) and &quot; &quot; mal@@ ign &quot; &quot; ( malign@@ ant cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or spreads easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients previously treated as chemotherapy alone . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; anti@@ plat@@ inum &quot; &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given prior to or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed , delayed , or reduced the dose . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therefore slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer run@@ time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ura othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study involving 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived on average 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. for the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
&quot; the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the bottle , and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - tro@@ phy advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after conclusion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Gift and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and intake continues throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after every third cycle of action .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te cen@@ sus . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , dose checks must take place under consideration of the n@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the instructions in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 Blood . &quot;
&quot; if patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before the treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical trials showed no indication that in patients at age 65 , or in comparison to patients aged 65 years , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require any dose adjustments beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of &gt; the maximum limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row sur@@ geri@@ es and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality number again reaches a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for other cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , was regarded as pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ term for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; many patients who occurred these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular room , a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be considered before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated living agents ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible pe@@ dest@@ al of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be pointed out , men should be pointed out before the treatment of g@@ inn , consult with regard to the sperm preservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can result in reduced phal@@ lic acid secre@@ tion resulting from an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is recommended if in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid to be avoided at a high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s are available with long half @-@ time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with decent an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in case of an application . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be pointed out , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice on the blocking of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is passed into the mother &apos;s milk and cannot be excluded from unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; side effects of frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data from spontaneous reports ) . &quot;

patients receiving All@@ i and receiving no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot de@@ construct some fats in the food , which causes about a quarter of the fats attributed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study of All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair step , stud @-@ pull , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , tran@@ ce o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which does not include sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant women and nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the marketing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical fatty acid .
&quot; it should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Sti@@ ll time ( see section 4.6 ) • Sti@@ ll @-@ time treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rhe@@ a ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with the simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma seal was observed . &quot;
&quot; with the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ins in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the dosing of a one @-@ off dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events voluntarily were reported by a population of in@@ definite magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
&quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal , overweight and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported cases reported , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , it is possible to derive from a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is applied in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fatty reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of the body weight compared to the starting value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
&quot; the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value of 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of wa@@ ist@@ line was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 For therapeutic doses , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ cin group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified with any particular danger to man . &quot;

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed is significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information information .
&quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in the elimination of fat from the body . &quot;
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the treatment begins since at this time you may have not yet reduced the fat percentage of your diet .
&quot; you can learn more about the normal fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions , which you normally take to yourself . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • diabetes • E@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Please talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended intake of calories indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
notice the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; the amount of calories available for you can be found in the information below , which is suitable for you . • Due to the action of the capsule , adher@@ ence to the recommended intake of fat is decisive . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle that amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by observing the recommended intake of fat , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . &quot;
&quot; 34 This decreased cal@@ orie intake should enable you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ stration and disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal every day , for example through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set up realistic calories and fat targets and to keep it . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calories and gre@@ asy and give guidelines to become more physically active .
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the powerful trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ thesis agent ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there are not enough information about the effects in this age group .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the bonding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies who are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; for a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : in the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer , and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting caused by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is offered at the same time from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron hem@@ med the activity of the five investigated chemotherapy drugs ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ i@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one , tri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and tri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , tri@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ser@@ tr@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , there were similar frequency of adverse events as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose drug relationships observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given , which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , who were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lication and to extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average term half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy dogs and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations it is possible that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the time of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a single intraven@@ ous stu@@ b injection the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; in patients suffering from severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure , which is considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lication and pro@@ long the action of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily for over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this permit must inform the European Commission on the plans for the marketing authorisation of the drug approved as part of this decision .

Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it to form the active substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s manufacturer submitted data to Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A &apos;s comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , it was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment were adjusted to the drug ( i.e. no signs of virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the active substance and the marketing drug would not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting up treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease returned to more patients than in the reference drug regi@@ men , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study was not sufficiently vali@@ dated in the study to the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sten@@ ing ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ aries ( cra@@ cking or cutting ) , sc@@ rap@@ ing and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not be effective against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was c@@ apped after the end of the treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( protein @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body &apos;s tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go at short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections sur@@ passed the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as agents or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected passage occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous oral treatment of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; in deciding whether to continue / termin@@ ate breast@@ feeding or continue the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , it should be weighed between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the place of administration , which concerned about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin mode of action is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the ri@@ bos@@ ome P @-@ B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center region .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ bol@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding order interactions and prevent normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some forms of infection should seem question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in the event of a non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sample took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in the human being after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , small participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rats @-@ micro @-@ test for in @-@ vi@@ vo chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ unken skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embryo study of rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected . &quot;
&quot; the holder of authorization for the market must ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ virus system , as in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;

&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show , you should end the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not use other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it has not been specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , on the mouth , or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is out of sight on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the area concerned with a sterile association or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure containing 5 , 10 or 15 gram o@@ int@@ ments , or in an aluminum bag containing 0,5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix is applied within the framework of a two doses existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the two doses existing can be brought to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix contains the same components as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Child , which has been approved since 1996 , and has been the registered vaccine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as part of a three doses existing vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data which supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts have also been used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in six and a 12 months gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ination boxes , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines may be vacc@@ inated with the relevant mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to hepatitis B vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the administration of other vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ eller success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected for thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood coag@@ ulation disorders , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection was administered simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ le @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immune defects have to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ eness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and sensitivity on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects reported that Ambi@@ rix had received pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to pro tape ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the test persons , who received the Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA , form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old was reported a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different statisti@@ cally .
&quot; serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - including 15 years , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 received three doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ wi@@ le , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to Ambi@@ rix in 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ o@@ answer , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ination received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with ambient rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for persons who were between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after the imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to the immun@@ ore@@ action observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refresh of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type B vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine it was administered , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed the current formulation similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and servo conver@@ sions as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ds on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in the waters contaminated by wastewater . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be completely protected from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus / is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) an ino@@ cul@@ ation may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ ching r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the second vacc@@ ination of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; with a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with ambient rix . &quot;
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of active components per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix becomes a person who suffers from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened by a disease or a treatment in your body &apos;s own defense or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Sa@@ ws to your doctor if you / your child receive further medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) , or if you have been vacc@@ inated / received or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) received / or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with ambient rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have become known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was launched only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is swal@@ lowed up on several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered by a gastro@@ stom@@ y @-@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study because am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without any active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ aps were effectively prevented in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle to high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information on this drug was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early man@@ ic@@ ular deficiency of carb@@ ine phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ cia .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS 56 % of patients had at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old baby with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous dosing of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound that con@@ ju@@ gates with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , therefore , is suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative channels of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated to the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after dosing of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yl at so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
&quot; after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable in the next morning after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients treated with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma seal on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; following the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no adverse effects ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swallow tablets nor do patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ born , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early man@@ ic@@ ular deficiency of carb@@ ine phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ cia .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yl , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain bark . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , seen with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess &quot;
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it may be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen for each gram . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ule form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory investigations are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may move into the breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , aband@@ on@@ ment of the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room with your hospital &apos;s emergency in order to initiate a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , loss of skin , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed is significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not specified in this information information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ iry date specified on the board and the container after &quot; User to &quot; exp@@ iry date .
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory investigations are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate out of the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) . &quot;
&quot; if angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI angi@@ ox , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any other ingredient . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , and in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the CH@@ MP Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the incorpor@@ ation of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is 0.1 mg / kg ( IV mg / kg ) followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is performed in another case , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after the PCI can resume the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt output of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one immediately followed intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of any angi@@ ox gift from angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values if possible , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose can be administered quickly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which is subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second dose dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose again check . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ fac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or elevated blood risk due to mal@@ functioning of hem@@ o@@ stom@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible patho@@ genesis . • severe non @-@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis .
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din most blood cl@@ ots occur at arter@@ ial points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , supervision of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after res@@ etting the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again achieved prior to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters are in any case regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development are insufficient ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ fac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in treated , women as well as patients over 65 years more often came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in point of point , decrease of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ al@@ isations which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on the data from a clinical study with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group as well as in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in treated , women as well as patients over 65 years more often came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organs in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken and the patient closely monitor with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the ani@@ on @-@ bond region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in gradually spl@@ its the bond of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , biop@@ sy @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or can not effectively process insulin . &quot;
&quot; insulin is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter service life than a short @-@ acting Human@@ insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes where the body cannot effectively process insulin .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was noted in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin per year . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin or any of the ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously with continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin need for patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; any change in effectiveness , the brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delays , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dose or breakdown of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should be under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , fluor@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ dine , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and reserves can be or are missing the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs into human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to change the injection site within the injection area continuously may occur in consequence of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or treated by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ c@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( in particular skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin levels the effect occurs faster and the run@@ time is shorter than in the case of a normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin dose in therapeu@@ tically relevant metering range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect of 0.3 e / kg or more , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin is twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ core effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data , a comparable post @-@ den@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , as is given with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; was insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; when is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ stresses before meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insul@@ at@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) given before the beginning of the meal was given ( illustration 1A ) as well as in comparison with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
&quot; after the beginning of the meal , insulin dose ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) was given after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
