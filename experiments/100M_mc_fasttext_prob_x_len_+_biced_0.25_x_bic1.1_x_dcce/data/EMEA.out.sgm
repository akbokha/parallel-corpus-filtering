<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid monitoring of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or using the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are taken at the same time as Abilify, the dosage of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably primarily a "partial agony" for receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters, to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazzol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with cervical dol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment has been studied."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the processed tablets and the solution to take (assimilate).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly greater disturbance than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) extrapyramidal disturbances (nausea), swelling (drowsiness), swelling (nausea), somnolence (drowsiness), drowsiness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety disorders."</seg>
<seg id="25">The CHMP's Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with Aripiprazole were predominant compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, exceeded the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the takeover of Abilify throughout the European Union to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and discussed their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicidal risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celeriac and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, occasional dyskinesia occurred during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with Abilify appear signs and symptoms of late dynasal anesthesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"for this reason, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients suffering from seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"there was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesired cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally associated with schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, resp. an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint administration of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteaseininhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>

<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this drug may not be used in pregnancy as a result of the insufficient data base for man and because of the concerns inherent in the reproductive studies of animals, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>

<seg id="71">"the symptoms associated with anti-psychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed with adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdosage of Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adrenergic gen and the histamine-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed an adverse effect compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study, over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a systemic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies more than 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed an adverse effect comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-surgical dol in week 12."</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) that cannot be adequately adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulfonic resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of acetone treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, so type 2 diabetes can be set better."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; in doing so, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonic resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>

<seg id="756">"Actos has led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels have been lowered when applying dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonic resins showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin reported a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoanesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor can patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine designed to protect against a trunk of the flu virus which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"a flu pandemic occurs when a new trunk of the influenza virus appears, which can easily spread from humans to humans because people have not yet built up immunity (no protection)."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"as a result, the immune system will later be able to form an antibody fast in contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus was removed with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognizes as a bodily alien), cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"in addition, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the active substance and the marketing drug would not suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting up treatment with Alpheon, the disease returned to more patients than in the reference drug regimen, and Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study was not sufficiently validated in the study to the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine)."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crustening) and small infected infirmaries (cracking or cutting), scraping and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not be effective against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface may not be more than 2% of the body's surface."</seg>

<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was capped after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (protein-filled cavities in the body's tissue) or infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the CHMP's Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo at short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections surpassed the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of retapamine ointment, the treatment is to be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known as agents or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamine ointment should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>

<seg id="2699">The retapamulin mode of action is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the bacterial ribosome which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the ribosome P-Bindungsstelle and the Peptidyltransferase Center region.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuroboltiline inhibits peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding order interactions and prevent normal education of active 50s ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance, the use of reapamulin at least some forms of infection should seem questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the event of a non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or can not effectively process insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter service life than a short-acting Humaninsulin."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body does not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults in type 2 diabetes where the body cannot effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was noted in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin per year."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or any of the ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to approve Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be used as a subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneously with continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin need for patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change in effectiveness, the brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delays, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in insulin requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dose or breakdown of treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should be under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, fluoroxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, the effects of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, clonidine, Guanethidin and reserves can be or are missing the symptoms of the adrenergic counter-regulation."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a correspondingly trained person or treated by intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (in particular skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with subcutaneous ga- be of insulin levels the effect occurs faster and the runtime is shorter than in the case of a normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin dose in therapeutically relevant metering range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportionate increase in the glucosal effect of 0.3 e / kg or more, just like human insulin."</seg>
