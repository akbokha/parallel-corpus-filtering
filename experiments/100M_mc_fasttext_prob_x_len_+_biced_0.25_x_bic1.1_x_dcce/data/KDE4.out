you will find the module web page in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Website . select the output and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list .
&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , no important decisions should be made dependent on the translations , without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose extensions set up .... Open the card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if available . &quot;
the view filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras view filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the page that is currently displayed . &quot;
the Module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation , a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful h@@ ue and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for the easy detection of the sh@@ utter depth or the representation of a different file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation or if the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; at Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always maintained . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , it is up to the implementation to be left to the extent that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot;
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras photo gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens that allows you to define the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option Pictures per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the File Name of the image , show if the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed in the gallery in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box File size of the image , show if the file size is displayed in the gallery in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you determine if the size of the images is displayed in the gallery in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub @-@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , enter where to save the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a slider or a turning field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the check box , copy original images , you determine if the original images should be copied to the gallery . &quot;
using the comment field comments file you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the outer color depth , you can specify a different color depth for thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML @-@ Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under window navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the standard browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition to one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the ID in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla , for example , M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the inserted browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry Con@@ figuration ... you can adjust the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
&quot; with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or module , check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents based on the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards . &quot;
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Website . you can make the following tests :
&quot; with the &amp; HTML ; test , you test whether your &amp; HTML ; document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; comp@@ lies with all found errors . with this check , you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers . &quot;
&quot; allow you to verify your &amp; CSS ; style sheets included in one &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS , your websites have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used . &quot;
&quot; check the links on your page on further instructions and faulty links . recur@@ sively , all links are reviewed on the website . &quot;
here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents and &amp; CSS ; style sheets .
with the module Web @-@ Archi@@ ver for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can store websites with text and images in .@@ war format .
click on Extras website with the mouse and a dialog appears to store the displayed website .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded via g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together . &quot;
&quot; you can use it to view , comment , evaluate , and correct your photos . the editing skills can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ came ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; cs ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this link , your web browser tries to report any problems or wishes .... This will open a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came , join . however , we would like to ask you to answer questions other users of &amp; digi@@ came . however , in this mailing list is spoken English , you should therefore be powerful this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; first time you want to start , you will be asked where to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder icon or select the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . this path is stored for all picture folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a collection of pictures on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; views each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed while searching the folder , you get a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste hidden in hidden folders . this can be done by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List have no pictures as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can in &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favor@@ ites to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it may be possible to handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw footage in the Help menu aid Roh@@ kam@@ era@@ backup . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded via g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact &amp; Flash , memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is then used as disk drive . the camera can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated in the meantime . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy his functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ came ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ came ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes were made in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in key words , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the icon view . thus , the filter works on the file name only if this icon is displayed . which fields are displayed , you can configure the settings in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; displays an organized view on your photo albums . all photos that were created by &amp; digi@@ came are stored in a single album tree , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created , sorted . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have a scanner set up , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to provide information about this collection . to access the album properties , right @-@ click on the album and select the album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method to highlight your albums so you can group them under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums After date sort .
&quot; the El@@ ders &quot; buttons , average , new test@@ ers : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the section of the album . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ came , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Def@@ ault &quot; &quot; in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be wasted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window displays the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fiers in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album the first time , you must wait short while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid using this in the Extras menu of All thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are , you can change the settings . select the albums page here and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the key features of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows one such help window .
&quot; photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as you like . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can choose from the view of the images , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit ... . image processing can be found in the editing section . image editing can be used to view photos and change them .
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of the file . to do so , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not en@@ um@@ er@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store this data if you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
the easiest way is to right @-@ click the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a photo from &amp; Records ; delete it , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer really del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ pp@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . thereby , you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold up parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word li@@ ste@@ quot ; fold up , so that you can find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or selecting a keyword , and then select a new keyword . if you add a new keyword after you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword keyword in the keywords . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; in order to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you have selected the photos you want with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also right click on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword ( s ) from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear in the main window to preview the image . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Del@@ ete menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo .
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ based adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can type a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side strip with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be used in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only need to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit the search , the form to enter the search appears again with the search information entered previously . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching . for more information , see the Tools for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the Find context menu . &quot;
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to add the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list using the search group , or delete it . any option may be associated with others via the logical Operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... In addition , you can create the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; one option . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from anywhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hands @-@ free sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the right pictures . also here a threshold value can be placed .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it out . move it to a square with the mouse wheel . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally requires that your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; sets a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl . the selection will be added to the light table and opened its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window , you can quickly open the light table with L Extras LED . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and drop them there . if you select to synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform the zoo or shift operations on one of the pictures , you will also be able to compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to order quickly from a picture series . if you use combination @-@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas of the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right @-@ hand side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nail images . this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data , for example . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the Pre@@ view mode , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as much as in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into and out . this happens in both pictures if you are previ@@ ewing in the mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or stores digital photos carries a form of digital stock management . most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we will provide you with a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , find , protect , download and use photos . we will focus on the processes for digital photographers using the &amp; digi@@ cam . we consider the download , ren@@ ame , remove , value , archive , archive , optimize , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Invent@@ ory takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , transformed , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then don &apos;t use it . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then don &apos;t use it . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ came ; . the approach can store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files and secure archiving to which you can access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you have something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found over your location unless you are in a year at the same place . if you take enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures to different subjects and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for that content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata option saved to the file &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do this , it has a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , since you should select each photo keyword , label and score . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in the future work . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords as you frequently call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded stit@@ ches , then &amp; digi@@ came ; automatically build up the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you just want to let most people see your photos only , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others viewing your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him over the motif you have moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
&quot; when you export your images in web galleries , you can export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , these labels will be exported to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web gallery system . so , you don &apos;t have to tell the story for publishing a second time . &quot;
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now has light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are innumerable and will be deep@@ ening in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily re@@ open your travels with geographic information . this will show the photos at the recording location . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , for example to protect the identity of the photographer . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the working title of the photographer . examples may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must also be completed . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . for private persons , this is only of little interest for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ came ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate errors , plate failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claimed a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . in spite of this massive protection , they use chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster for defective CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; slowly burn the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that this media can read . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ mis@@ sal study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common failure cause , S@@ MA@@ RT does not notice these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT are the most common cause of failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not make up a lot , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage to devices , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should also ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks that also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . if you buy a US@@ V you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how good your computer is protected . finally , you should always remember all cables to tr@@ enne before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . using the right configuration , you can use it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are , compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos online . the professional version provides you more at your disposal , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more dramatically . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality first . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed memory in the offer . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a lower level and are highly scalable . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem , which is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is using and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % on job systems . in case of lap@@ tops the proportion of theft is 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it results in less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no one has been spotted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : incorrect , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dest file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , back up your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of disks or res@@ izing hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hits you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aer@@ op@@ lanes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore Des@@ aster Pre@@ vention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete f@@ use : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete assurance and the last differential protection .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time to which such a backup has been made . this f@@ use comes next with the exception , which is only scann@@ ed and not continuous . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only dup@@ lic@@ ates the difference of files that have really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
secure important pictures right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata , stored in the image file , retained IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... &quot;
&quot; with that valuable pictures survive the next 40 year survival that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you must consider everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered based on explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard if necessary . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression of the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # modify the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software available , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ format image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML based X@@ MP technology in 2001 , Adobe its XML . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . however , it can cause problems with the connection between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and community work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera editing , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images again ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the copy@@ righ@@ ted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code in m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ came ; to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ came . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect this to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . you will find a further description in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. will appear on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the met@@ a metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then the selection of all download . this loads all photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ came ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected download button is gre@@ ased until you have selected some pictures . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New is available for download . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the buttons All download or download selected , a dialog will appear where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , hit OK , and &amp; digi@@ came ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . if you want to delete only a few , you need to select them first and then delete selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore the photos you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the camera is deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the camera sensor completely , you should do this with your camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ps . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the first two concern the data concerning the author in the section Standard authentication . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC Fiel@@ ds . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % S % H : % M . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name option , you will have the option to change the file name in lower@@ case . or in upper case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ came ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ came ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the page page on the Met@@ adata page , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it leaves &amp; digi@@ came ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date the photo has been taken , it can be used to create sub@@ albums in the target album . not all cameras provide this information . in the page page on the Met@@ a data section , you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ al@@ b option at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you where the images should be uploaded . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be used by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; user who can locate the location of the photograph , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how come the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and last about manual entry of known locations . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few people working with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format that is supported by the ge@@ o @-@ geographic mapping module . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ characters ha@@ ft@@ ete coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ came ; change . to access these settings , you have to set up as much control over his work procedures as possible . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be set to preview or start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ came ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are written automatically in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; the title should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to indicate that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ der@@ s. it is achieved that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . these metadata are also available for other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ came ; imported without being lost .
&quot; images saved as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ came ; display each file in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; album folder that has none of these extensions is by &amp; digi@@ came ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the illuminated button can be set to the standard values . if you then open the lumin@@ aire , these settings can be set on to the default values . however , some images have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture . these colours are defined here . in image processing , this visible mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression option , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; comp@@ ress the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images with the TI@@ FF File option . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ came , image processing was only an image viewer for photos . at present , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when white balance is not set . default is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the pointed @-@ lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned in the settings , because of the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings . the setting colors will trigger some unusual results , since they display the top lights in various ros@@ ettes . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the highlights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ came ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
&quot; when selecting the Recon@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore / should be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ unch small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&quot; after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your l@@ enti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for correction correction since you are carried out during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the other are to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions if an image is opened in image processing , start / color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Fol@@ der here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; Standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
&quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures color does not color the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not have for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image is given by a device again . this is very useful before you can print image , as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can be very saturated . this could be done manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion lets you recognize the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; nbsp ; image viewing and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules supported to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and they will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can set short commands in the menu under Settings .
&quot; for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show on the left @-@ hand side a list of all supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . among them are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; digi@@ came ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window screen . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ ser@@ mer , you can indicate the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details . &quot;
the editorial changes due to the right side panel can be tac@@ itly adopted by &amp; digi@@ came ; applied if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without using any queries . otherwise you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also indicate the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ came . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; the setting When launching new photos is forced &amp; digi@@ came ; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the starting time of &amp; digi@@ came ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ came ; you , if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ came ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar settings below . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ came , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or through the contex@@ tual menu of the preview and selection of the ad / edit . &quot;
&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ arrived , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and underneath it the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
&quot; the editing features of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file save or button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the picture . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the restore from the File menu or using the button Res@@ et the Image editing button Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
almost every action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit back and restore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to the back and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click on the recall button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
&quot; you can enter into the photo and zoom in , in which you use C@@ trl , mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the refer@@ ee menu . &quot;
&quot; to make a photo of the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you &apos;ll get to the normal view , in which you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ came . you can call this from the &amp; digi@@ came ; main window . see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select print from the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print individual pictures or entire sets . whole picture pages can be printed out of your choice . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ ports Druck@@ Assistent . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation bar , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so you can be used by other programs .
&quot; IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the user button , there is one button More . this allows you to read further metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you choose a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field and the encoding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered keyword . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief for entering key words in a series of pictures . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar stit@@ ch filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . if additionally one or more stit@@ ch filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the top example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on a keyword , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched on mis@@ cell@@ aneous settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it needs to be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I have made it mainly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable vari@@ ance from the actual scann@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should provide you with detailed background information about color management . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so you can get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other image issues are via email or the web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limits compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work just in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you must c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB is c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ated . the c@@ alli@@ bri@@ zation of your monitor closes the circle . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic lev@@ elling and Con@@ trast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction menu to automatically try to make the best of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous strength over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade . &quot;
&quot; this method j@@ uts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracle effects or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot;
&quot; contrast increases : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest possible range and a re @-@ aging of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited since about a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry color white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adjusted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top right , a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjusting allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or di@@ mming down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance that you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save them your original image will be changed .
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is to be found in the menu under color sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same correc@@ tions . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under paints gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool color effects provide you four color effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that resulted in a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image completed . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar power effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the intensity applied is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for a colour @-@ optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot , and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can look at the different color levels of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if the result you like , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous strength / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on sound value correction for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the application purpose explained here . more specifically the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and to keep track of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the image &apos;s settings , and the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often called gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively , as with the input ratings . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the entries are automatically re @-@ adjusted for all shadows , medium and solar tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the entries of the Hist@@ ogram for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ance Chann@@ els . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example for adjusting entry values on the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will appear . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fier Channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel to be changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is most useful . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short cord to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker pron@@ gs and that the corresponding pixel pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo you can see a red marking . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is shown on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel , you will see the combined result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades have been placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
selecting the channel selection box allows you to select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared with your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right at the bottom : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction will allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ anz , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you activate the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me . this is especially convenient if you also activate the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , since the channel mixer then is the tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color will result in a visible h@@ ue that comes from the color channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion thereby improving the color space at first . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved later and then loaded . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only see the effect in the preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating about your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles . &quot;

&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scen@@ eries and aerial photos . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar light scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold to the Sch@@ att@@ ent@@ ö@@ nen . this is very similar to the process of missing a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of increased points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect was applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
&quot; keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . to keep an eye on the picture is a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . passing through it with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , covered it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the pattern decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you used the tool to cut after aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this can also be done in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any adjustment you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
using the &amp; digi@@ came ; Tool Tem@@ plate can apply a template over a picture .
the Picture Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image processing to create templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should add maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil database , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the root folder in the dialog . here , select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for templates has been set , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder appears . the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview bar of the templates . &quot;
&quot; under the Pre@@ view , there are three buttons that allow you to change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this knob increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shrink the pattern below . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and set it to the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ came ; puts three different tools available for sharpen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
&quot; the same phenomenon can be observed when printing ink points on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when printing ink points on paper . normally , SL@@ R cameras usually require longer @-@ term sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used in internal sharpen@@ ing . however , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a focus filter already while reading the image . if you de@@ activate this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this can be done using the correc@@ tive sharpen@@ ing menu . &quot;
&quot; in general , the sharp@@ est technique is increasing the edge of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is re@@ focusing the tool . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing under re@@ focusing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much simpler than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to draw a little soft drawing , and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . if you make the blur@@ red mask strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will be created near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is one like many pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount is the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , you can define a minimum difference with it for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharp@@ ness and hence f@@ law errors in faces , skies and water surfaces avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted de@@ f@@ ission filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the g@@ auss &apos;@@ sche fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; use this parameter if your blur@@ ry is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameters you have set will be saved later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ favourable arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mask produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mask to use a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; even under optimal conditions , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the field correction methods in digital images , you can find a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area which has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool for removing unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ or in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration , and the available pres@@ ets are listed below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be given details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a little value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie set or CCD noise , a high value wa@@ vy pattern will produce . JPEG Artef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle step@@ wise &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles can produce a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated walking distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low , but it doubles the run@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . to correct any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; image errors can be corrected quite quickly at work . however , it can take a very long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how image errors are corrected with Kleine Artef@@ akte . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that occur e.g. of dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the picture . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . if it is increased , noise tips will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
edges : checks the edge accuracy of the filter . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it is not possible to remove the entire noise or rocket tips . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ous density : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ening process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ut tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more corro@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is on its minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use the tool for sof@@ tening soft markings and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adjusted to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the contours of the image and thereby gets the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture translation . the texture setting is done with another tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this setting is to correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with an sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
&quot; below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old colour photo that was scann@@ ed with a scanner . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows to remove hot@@ pixels of photos with a CCD camera gem in eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , since many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; to remove on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the button Dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the suitable dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , applied from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ came ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise the sharp@@ ness effects are caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by using an a@@ qui@@ valent transformation on an image without this filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker &apos;s copyright law . &quot;
&quot; with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the grade of light @-@ strength atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the largest density , the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , causing an optical filter to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ ability , reduce it to compensate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , fla@@ ke however on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two can almost eliminate any geomet@@ rical distortion .
&quot; in general , this value controls the thickness of the second degree distortion . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth grade . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter General .
&quot; zoom : this value is sc@@ aled to scale the image size , resulting in a correction of first degree . negative values increase while positive the image is smaller . &quot;
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as default values . &quot;
&quot; the spher@@ ical or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all tri@@ mming or size changes . best perform this correction first . if you re@@ cut a picture and after that perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the spher@@ ical / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from the editing tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR @-@ red film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the Pre@@ view , you can adjust the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , since the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ esystem applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the highlights .
&quot; the digi@@ cam filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny look especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , then you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better for large pictures . smooth@@ ed controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel is 1 and G@@ lät@@ te 17 .
pictures of their gra@@ dients which define the outlines are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch for you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower one adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ red effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; motion sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ts the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft @-@ drawing Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ts the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ts the image through random shift of pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ ts them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo in rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it through filling with an average pixel value .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
&quot; the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . thus , it gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm . &quot;
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops .
&quot; you can use the &amp; digi@@ came ; image editing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face that should remain free . after that , the filter will start the area free from ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ y filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how you can blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was infl@@ ated by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; maintaining aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more it will be smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge any st@@ int for photo , can be saved as text file and loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo blowing is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo blowing by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; the editing of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows to create a picture with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . then you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse . &quot;
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out . this allows you to change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the Edit button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , always the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; below in the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the range to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the tri@@ mming tool next time , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflects the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the merge help enable help to blend your images , so that you can better assemble your pictures . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden center : the golden middle is a division that is divided into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the Ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you place your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden middle provides fluid relief lines at your disposal when you place a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the gold spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the golden rect@@ angle . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographer . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options are mirr@@ ored and vertical can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are rot@@ ated vertically or horizont@@ ally . &quot;
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are shown in degrees . with the default knob you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ieren cutting out of image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automati@@ cally Rand@@ om . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the top left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture is lubri@@ cated a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get endless tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the mold is used to move a part of the image to the right and the lower part to the opposite . a horizontal sh@@ ading , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a right triangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by transforming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; you can switch horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ eting , the picture is blur@@ red a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two loops are generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the she@@ ar , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; it requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; this is done based on the file extension and a comparison of it with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file extension will be displayed . you can change this list of the file extensions that have been deleted . in the configuration section you will find more information about this . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . in this way , redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the shell format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ came . &quot;
the table below shows more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats that came from &amp; digi@@ came ; supported :
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . if you click on a movie file , you can view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file , you can view or edit movies . &quot;
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can go forward only if you went back before .
synchron@@ izes the metadata between the database and all files of the current main window . the images inherit the metadata of the database and not the other way around this menu .

&quot; sorts all pictures in the current album by their name , path , date , file size or their rating . &quot;
&quot; the metadata bank will be over@@ written by the data of the files in the event of deviations , the other variant can be started from the Album menu . &quot;
all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please see the camera section for more information .
K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
&quot; if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ came ; contain your description here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ten@@ er , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; use a uniform dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ able ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one is the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image you want to see . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are derived from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it out . move it to a square with the mouse wheel . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally requires that your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the Di@@ alogue Palette you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders to browse files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described under the pallet screen . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box When inser@@ ting cursor under the Color button is enabled , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ write . you can set this mode by selecting the check box Over@@ write under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions to copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data on clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows . so if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color choos@@ er on the left side .
&quot; graph will be used in science , in particular in computer science , so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs that include &amp; graph ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;

&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file is currently being modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose if the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; may also remember your decision , so later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but these changes also with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be divided on several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . the page relationship is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) , or om@@ it the program every time . &quot;
the page opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; specify a default behavior for this case set ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
you can specify a default behavior ( open or not ) to set a default behavior ( open or not ) at any start .
&quot; the context menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the jumping power model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board design for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ its @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multiple lat@@ tice timer for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . with such a layout command , you can add &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms specify special options , or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ fied graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element with this mouse poin@@ ter to get more help to this item ( if any ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images read tools available to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
&quot; scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project , or another source like e.g. Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed . &quot;
&quot; when you open the menu entry pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default duc@@ ts , to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be shown to you in the right lower corner . &quot;
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may otherwise not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you need to wait for the scan to complete and specify the type of image file . please remember that type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and create very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select or create by storing the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import - &gt; Screen Photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; if you choose the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value of maximum size registered . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your collection to a gallery server .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the ge@@ o loc@@ alization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width ratios are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . this file contains , of course , data that was taken back at the same time at the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ Data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera direction must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . here , set your camera time zone . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera direction . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have a trace data from a place for images you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the knob cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog box takes the coordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
&quot; the location can also be found and placed with the shown map . select the relevant region and enlarge it . you always have to choose between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Picture Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to version 4.@@ 01 in a picture gallery of HTML pages . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed . &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder from where you are writing . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth you can change the standard color depth , which naturally also affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tab preview images allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically shut down . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and use basic operations such as rotation , zoom or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and short@@ com@@ ings . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality and metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since there is no compression of color information . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently does not have any documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of images or the content of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to re@@ play the file on a TV , you must select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep the extension mp@@ g . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can start the creation of the film quickly or in all tranqu@@ ill@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the Settings right below . &quot;
&quot; the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo formats . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is , for example , useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module directly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats , JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information in your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently or you should not use the JPEG format later , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file into the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the execute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all the images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on image orientation , and the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
non Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program .
&quot; after you started the module , the images -@@ window with the images you have chosen will appear . add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last image selected , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add the list of images to be sent .
the images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject .
do not make sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and sent to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted in the los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the sending images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window appears with questions like you want to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop allows the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option Pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used to order the pictures in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects another effect with each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; on the lower panel of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse through this image and see the picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are now in each group , in people , places , and group keyword entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images . in the following , each is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse on the entry persons , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the images displayed are displayed on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . &quot;
&quot; in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to choose which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the image @-@ refer@@ ee window ( described in more detail ) and select the categories image editor . in the expl@@ orer window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed and / or trun@@ cated . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the Find entry in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more . &quot;
&quot; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options at the bottom of the window , you can search all images by name , as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , screen photos and introductory videos . &quot;
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog select the demo in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; first time you start or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
&quot; if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays data statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview ) and furthermore , the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and clicking the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , thus the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual we will describe the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can access via the File HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each section is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that all images are displayed by a party . note that all images are displayed by a party . note that all images are exported at the moment . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so , you can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , search . if it wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best select a base folder for all of your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . here , you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to copy them manually . to make the import function , see , correctly works , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the root folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings you have just described have been related to all three root folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time looking at the pictures , location , etc . , then you have to go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not make this work again . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and pass this file independently . the obvious down@@ side , however , is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , this is only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file with the Manual option near the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally Copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so simply select the export file option .
&quot; the last option of this page is limited to maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you may not want to send the pictures in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called by your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window which categories should be imported to the import file and which categories correspond to them in your database . &quot;
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to import with the categories of your current database . see an example for this in the picture .
&quot; it has to be easy to browse images and view : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) setting out the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) searching and standing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it will also take care of your videos . in many places in this manual , you can talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; it is a simple XML file that lets you back up with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want to . &quot;
&quot; if you want to start another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c folder . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can change to a window , where you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings can be explained to you . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of one group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
in the left half of the window there is a list of the current categories and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&quot; it shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , they have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or through the Help menu . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications using the K@@ IP@@ I modules are very different , which makes it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order after albums so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures you see the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category persons , you will have &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you have selected people to view and pass on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window that you can browse your picture database . &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to view each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture where the image has been taken . for example on all images Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are m@@ apped , you can make that the used names are moved upwards , finding people faster and assign@@ ing them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and provide these pictures with comments . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located below the picture to the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item more multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window which indicates the USA as an over @-@ group . to show you that it is an over @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialogue is it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a sub @-@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking on the bar that forms the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window from a frame by moving it outside of the window area . &quot;
&quot; when you adjust the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the options ... , which offers , among other things , the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also show a frame completely . if you want to get this window again displayed later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . see this in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , it will appear in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the picture preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press the Edit Sel@@ ection menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , you can use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures at which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires that you copy files from the folders and copy them back into it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end , those you want to make for others and click on the latest view bar in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all images that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry All except for current view . &quot;
&quot; with this you have fixed which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click Lock to lift . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; for one , all images on the hard drive and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml , can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered via the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with your mouse and drop it somewhere else . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the pop @-@ up context menu can be viewed at the bottom . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image high and the image down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and finish . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide show . how often it can load a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image after a few seconds . start and stop the slide show by the keys C@@ trl ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is to be changed in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
when you use the viewer you can drag in the picture and zoom out . using the Min@@ us button you can easily pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . show how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn . with the power button sets the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image on the screen . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work in videos work in and out with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments about the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
if you look at pictures it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while viewing them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can use a feature to press the corresponding letter . in the picture you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have features placed on your images , these are available in your browser . if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , you can easily view all of them at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the character for the characteristic after selecting the image . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must not fully master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; however , the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray should be read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow is displayed .
&quot; you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to be able to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview the property view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ divided element . if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected , or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as pres@@ et . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the probe to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the whole height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window ordering is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to remove a view from anch@@ oring , pull the feeder onto the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the front panel . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the front panel . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with view window setup ... saving it . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dern symbol to render the icon rendering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The render settings in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the frame for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection illumination . &quot;
&quot; when a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , besides sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general view images with this property better off .
&quot; when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; and P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling is adap@@ tively recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split further and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ure depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) extra rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be followed individually and further under review . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
on this map you can adjust whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays don &apos;t have an object .
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import one &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the Im@@ porting menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for displayed object . here , set the path to your document retention and version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of vision in the camera view and in the window type marks .
&quot; you can set the object catch of points on the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model view . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail for extended projections , all wi@@ re@@ model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with the exceptions of the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when displaying a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; when you cross ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you activate edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders , it explains how you can create and save window orders . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ation Field Def@@ ault window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new layout can be created using the Add button and removing a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can be created with the Add button and Del@@ ete selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result , you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following set of windows : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . now you have a scene without objects .
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera views the entire scene you generate . in particular , you notice it in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press the user button or the input key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a simple method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the user button or enter the input key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ per view now also shows the plane , even if at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the level expands up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should shift the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line , just allow you to get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pigment preview only shows a black black material because you need to check the pigment appearance at any time . &quot;
&quot; when you preview no paint on qu@@ ader and bul@@ let , just click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you now render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the Color List you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose single @-@ colored and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to push the input key or button apply ) , so the ball contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have shifted the floor around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a black black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select First Ob@@ jects and change the name for example in sphere of pigment . click on the Pig@@ ment ball , then select Single @-@ color and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the input key .
&quot; the settings shine effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of the possibilities of you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . hopefully , you &apos;ve learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer cap@@ tures hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as mist effect . thus , the scene pixel is edited for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
restore the scene in the last saved version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since the last storage .
you can select this menu entry only if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the least rever@@ ted command . you can select this menu entry only if you have used Edit Ru@@ le .
save the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ ride an existing layout .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts , and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . using this option , you can set the default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands . &quot;
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a dump @-@ map is a way to model rough surfaces without having to model any hi@@ ght on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in their own window in the size of the image or full@@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or return the button Return .
you can adjust whether each image should be displayed in your own window or if all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
use this option to save the name of the recently opened folder . open the name of the last opened folder . the next start will open &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed that can also display the program .
&quot; with this option , the display window is extended to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
determine whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts here for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ came ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photograph ; an open source project . this means it depends on the fact that the user contributes its part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; acknowledge and hopefully soon answer questions from other users . in this mailing list however English is spoken you should be powerful this language .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , is to join the developer mailing list . manual for joining the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; change . to access these settings , you have to select the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; change to these settings . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by pressing on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photograph ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer make as images to scan and save .
&amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes available as images to scan and save images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a default scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner was specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to use , and press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options particularly .
&quot; to start a picture , the user can first start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom to match the complete preview in the window . &quot;
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a breakdown and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the dialog of the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows you to select the way &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog to save each image opens the dialog before any scann@@ ed image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the image automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE @-@ help with the &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the knob displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ;

&quot; below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . below , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the short commands ... Select . &quot;
you may set up any existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included .
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , every script needs to be taken care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is picked up . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece ( e.g. the metadata or the piece length ) with D@@ CO@@ P functions .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value of 0 to 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le tracks the path to selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) . to remove an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the Signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clean up . this includes storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which the user &amp; z@@ b have downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the suff@@ oc@@ ation of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script pack@@ ets correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
if your script package is finished you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of going through endless menus . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you &apos;ve already some play@@ lists , but can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please tell them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be enabled or disabled to compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requi@@ rements section . &quot;
&quot; activate de@@ bu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily set up the setup dialog without effort . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; the Player window will display the player window in addition to the playlist , respectively . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok is compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches the experimental function of the m@@ ood@@ le bar@@ ometer . &quot;
shaping atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; save voice files to music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok is compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok . ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save play@@ lists while you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you end &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while you end . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep track of the current piece , the playlist window will open / un@@ roll in order to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
changes to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the sel@@ ectable color sel@@ ector for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; resume playback on startup , causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece , with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color spaces opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the Display option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ screen environment should appear the O@@ SD .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate further setting options in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder to the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search both the scann@@ ed and their sub@@ folders to music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser later . &quot;
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected yet another facility is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the map last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces played and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes in reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b Develop@@ er under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X then this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . disable if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the email will open automatically at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s , but they do not mark the Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; &quot; &quot; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b
&quot; this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting displays its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok can find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily clari@@ fied by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC among ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears just an empty playlist . how do music pieces come into it ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window was converted to the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate tracks , the score must be displayed in the playlist . click the button on the playlist and select column . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist , and drop them there , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s that simple : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the button Play@@ list is saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also , look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; none . yes , that really is true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be supported by G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . &quot;
&quot; maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 @-@ Dec@@ or can be supplied in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in searching for the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( for example , sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; you can either use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine instead , or install K@@ DE multimedia fully to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strong for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components , register them to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the ff@@ m@@ peg file , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder ( you will find the module folder with me @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . in addition the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and use the alarm to run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok starts ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , variable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ trl + Right button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input key after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , use files from the folder mp3 or o@@ gg instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can select the rating for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then , select the rating . then you can select the evaluation of a piece just as much by clicking on the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata . &quot;
the developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan that cannot be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon while playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select the tool@@ bar settings ... and make the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too similar . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok , while browsing through the cross @-@ section . then click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the Add Amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and a password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you need to re@@ compile and install . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without a P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not compile L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when comp@@ iling Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer fair@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
&quot; set in settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output specify the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one . &quot;
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } h@@ w : 1 } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } .
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output is done on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick with sound card supported m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so badly needed assistant for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist &apos;s playlist , save it with the help of the playlist , save it . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio @-@ CD in the menu bar . a file browser with multiple folders and CD @-@ pieces will open in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD feature uses the audio track : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Bren@@ nen function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
&quot; if you install those pack@@ ets via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like every normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains several browsers that allow you to capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used ; including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below it is the area , the game time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , you will also find the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or the volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , don &apos;t let the abundance of functions be deter@@ red , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser features three sub@@ windows : music , text , and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will be explained in detail later . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used previous versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has been distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , the performers and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first part in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , the interpreter and the album . below , you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . here you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . images can have any name , but images with the word front in the name are given prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended items . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played back immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded Parts are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last area , albums of the interpreter , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on any of the pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running yet , you can choose which to be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Find button will open a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to an interpreter and a further layout is made according to the respective album . if you want to see combinations or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group interpretation / year - album - Sor@@ ted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group Album - All albums of your collection are shown alphabe@@ tically . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first shown by genre and among them by performer .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - this setting works just like the above , but additionally sorted according to album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . information about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; there is a selection field under the search filter , which allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select your complete collection from the last 24 hours to a year . furthermore , you can also select your complete collection , which makes the filter practically shut off . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ aks up the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces from the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name to save the list .
&quot; transfer the pieces into the queue to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore , the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) move files to the garbage dump ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; marking as a compilation - Mark@@ es the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
summ@@ ing Up - Change a compilation selected album back into a normal album . the album is then no longer listed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
&quot; the playlist browser is quite simple to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Sub@@ window Media Player is used for connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use , for example , your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod random@@ ly sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the titles you want from the playlist and drop them on the performer &apos;s list . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded onto your iPod . when the transmission is finished , end &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive binding for your iPod . &quot;
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press En@@ ter button , you can use music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of the Shift key can be useful . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert random files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all of the pieces attached to you . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the mouse to the desired position . as soon as you enter letters , you will only see the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter search words separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two , and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three are found ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , comment : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that include either Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad .
&quot; you can specify the number of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button , which allows you to add the playlist pieces . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one shown in the player window via the right mouse button . this menu allows you to set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces . furthermore , the status of random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking twice in the appropriate display area with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking menu in the playlist . using this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
one click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; behind this entry , there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left hand side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue administration received your large entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will be a number next to the title . this number represents the order in the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add the queue a piece , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
&quot; add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist , so you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to work this dynamic playlist . &quot;
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Lo@@ ad . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you will have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended items are added to the next piece of pieces , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : setting Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New Edit button will fill up the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can modify the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; here , enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed while listening to the settings . &quot;
pieces played - this is the number of played pieces that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were played recently .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces will be added from each of the play@@ lists you have checked . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ scripts by installing on the script . after installing the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button to fetch more scripts . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do this , select the script to be deleted then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins will be used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you need to have a run @-@ up of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ encoding MP3 s a bad quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a run @-@ up of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . now you see a dialogue that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the input of the original into the image file is completed , you will be prompted for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the total progress reaches 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the total progress reaches 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features , which also offers &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burnt audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder@@ - and En@@ co@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature set full of features to edit , dis@@ assemble and analyze video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; Norm@@ alize : this tool is useful for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces play differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and to automatically play all videos in the root folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog save is displayed with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call file saving for each single project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has changed and has not yet been stored , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen , you can then choose between storage and change . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file lock . &quot;
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any un@@ saved project is asked what to do with it as if you called file closing .
&quot; when you visit this entry , you can select the files to be added to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are moving the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the root folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties . the only difference is the additional knob burning , the &amp; 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by what is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it is useful if you want to compile files from a previous session to the current project . it is useful for you to see files and folders already existing on the medium .
&quot; this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; the copy of a CD opens to another medium without the project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of copy dialogue is not supported , so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; this dialog opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ ment@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously loaded DVD video can be converted . this dialog appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all @-@ in . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains the properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is checked , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog to change the ke@@ ying orders for &amp; 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is designed to person@@ alize and to fine @-@ tune the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the somewhat more convenient K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task will be very important to you , which of the included programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b has started ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all the &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void of bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference project . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ ter@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) void . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that code these wa@@ v files ( compression ) by default . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this has to be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as stated , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while the setup has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , more information such as this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data is started according to the setup of a request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case you first have to connect to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup catalog - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der as the default . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der in the encoding settings tab has been configured in the setup dialog .
&quot; opens the File Manager , so that an already loaded file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; to read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the kind of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; exit ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you must go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 quality at low bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important since both co@@ aters generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates compared with O@@ GG . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG subscri@@ bers is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resul@@ t@@ ant compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate , about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information which is manually entered or downloaded by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add to the key words ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database in which people can read / enter audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is meant by the author ) am not attorney . and moreover , the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively a check box to select ( sending an address ) . in this way of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( this can only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that use c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; those who want to know it more closely , look for source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution , if this hasn &apos;t happened yet . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) can be selected on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the enco@@ der package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . for more information on enco@@ ders , please refer to the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a coding , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading rights to it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program make exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and start our first &amp; CD . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . in any case , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg by trying to copy something inside ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ der to use the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) . as we are lazy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them for each reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map &quot; &quot; General Settings &quot; . &quot; there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only with incomplete information queries , so you will be informed if information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD automatically download data via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet while reading &amp; CD ; so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is simple , will start a &amp; CD ; entry is immediately associated with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries . the directory name and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database first . however , the two selection boxes must be selected , at least the first one . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . &quot;
&quot; mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls drill the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the protocol is usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so just try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this out : tick this to cast the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if you want to save the files in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something needs to be strai@@ gh@@ tened to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is sufficient for very good audio quality . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section we will describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD is going on ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , is described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each release &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , consult the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will fade , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic request from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need to connect to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited length of length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the encoding settings tab , and take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; for more information go to the web page of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the item in the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the button on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the selection to read the read @-@ out process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you see this error message if you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration option found to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem during simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last song is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls up many different programs , has many variations of settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely , if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time editing of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it works on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also works . &amp; k@@ mid ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can drag any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
&quot; session support . if you quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the playing button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item , or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with multiple pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the tempo display to change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a pressure on the button pause , or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so you do not need to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function has the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played back to the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu item under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the one in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not saved . remember when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if Automati@@ cally add to the collection , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the next opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the pop @-@ up sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or choose random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button Pre@@ vious piece , the item Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select there the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events in Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , making it sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order , nor leave any line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( a gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here , the term drum patch is meant to represent another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , tank , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ boards for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to depic@@ t sounds on the percussion channel . see the included Key@@ maps as an example .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to another . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; in this case , if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which proportion pitch @-@ ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event , then it is re@@ directed to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al com@@ mas are standing ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM states that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value of 40@@ 96 , will play a ton higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you will find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button no longer lights green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) . &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default speed , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
&quot; I have open on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&quot; at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much spare time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as a hobby I have programming , collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will set up ( if you want this ) . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and paid by anyone for it . I would like to emphasize that I can only continue to program because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , Mr. Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Mr. Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Mr. Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
and of course I also thank all these excellent musicians on the web that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find there links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you are using a FM device or an AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is reproduced in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you are looking for an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select it from the menu view and next edit mode . by cli@@ pping a sub @-@ group , only the XML content is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select Play@@ list from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without matching with the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; In the source package of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is one tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c , just like installing the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . &quot;
flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to allow the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the set @-@ up dialog of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a console application and searched for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type is always taken ( of course only if this was determined ) , this must be done by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the scanner can be configured from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port is to be used . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , different names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
&quot; there are hints how to do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom points to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts only slowly but why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; Ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further complic@@ ation and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact over the Ki@@ le ; website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions regarding or comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; on or out , extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ desktop environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . finally , the easy to operate assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; adverti@@ se ; and to know its possibilities , the manual is to be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ y ( English . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the last name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; while here just a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to control properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; as well as other label languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ as are set as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ set { document document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document document } . &quot;
the Quick Initi@@ ation Assistant from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a convenient function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard offers some possibilities for creating the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : this means the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
&quot; encoding : with this , the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they only need to be selected in the check box . &quot;
&quot; articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Let@@ ter ( DIN ) , Brief Article ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and more detailed information will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , there is a simple problem finding that any mathematical environment has not been closed . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le , automatically exec@@ utes an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; this function can be automatically set up in the box settings box ; set ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the lowest and sub@@ section the bottom element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files . once a DVI file is created , click &amp; Ki@@ le ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font , and besides PDF , there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the watch@@ word search , the elements of the DVI file are applied to the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is applied . as soon as a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been cli@@ cked , becomes the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer spr@@ ints . &quot;
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . a master document simpli@@ fies work with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
fast Construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is used for &quot; &quot; on @-@ the @-@ back &quot; , &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; when looking at the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large fields of selection should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for fast input of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The verti@@ ble &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the other choice is for items such as keywords , notes , notes or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection possible ) .
&quot; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can naturally also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le , by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ ach &quot; &quot; is used for setting the font names . it is possible to specify the font sizes for the main text , the joints , etc . , the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the clas@@ ps according to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the push of a button . &quot;
&quot; the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le , automatically exec@@ uting the storage . &quot;
&quot; if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors . when using rapid construction , it should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written text button , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } is possible , so that the change of the font sizes in the surrounding area will be added . &quot;
the changes are ensured only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to specify the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat printing , short@@ cuts , etc . these commands end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the short @-@ term pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be shown in ital@@ ics with \ \ alo@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le is followed . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . for this , a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should come to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output , such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screen . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as required for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI file ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this only Modern must be set up at Set Ki@@ le ... tools building will be selected .
&quot; in order to find out the preference search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on for@@ wards search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer takes place then . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular , with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the appropriate line . &quot;
&quot; should there be any errors when using the quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; viewer , an error may be present . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message box . &quot;
&quot; the log files are subject to errors in the source code . in the editor , the bugs of La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors are used . in order to view the incorrect line , the errors in the log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the incorrect line . &quot;
&quot; once clicking on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template used for the document . the options presented are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the assistant can be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; box ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Set Ki@@ le ... settings General settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created this way , the following steps have to be carried out : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your template can then be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for on the internet and carried through the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; uses &amp; makes ; used as internal editor . &amp; nbsp ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to find out more about this , and to know its options , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called over the Help La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a descrip@@ tive description of nearly all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; -@@ word to choose from . this means that when you click on \ \ par to \ \ par to \ \ big@@ scale only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can capture extra jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . thereby , the menu stit@@ ches are highlighted in the text . the menu stit@@ ches are also highlighted , so that they are automatically retri@@ eved when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; though &amp; gt ; already offers excellent options , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for selecting a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code added . &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bent thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the absen@@ ces are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word below the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command will also choose &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders with a return stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , naturally this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for this reason , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many sp@@ ook@@ y ambient commands you can quickly lose the view over . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be broken . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups defined by stap@@ les { ... } . using the Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot;
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or behind the braces one &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted group par@@ enth@@ eses you can quickly lose overview . this command closes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex groups is not broken . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two easy dressing signs is used . also for the ending of the application the character &quot; &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and will use two ports for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double bond sign can be set up under Set Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
&quot; ad specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) can be used , as well as German or French dressing signs . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when you check Shift ; Regi@@ ab@@ et@@ aste is a smart line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . while this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not associated , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; add some space to the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; gt ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are three different modes available . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic handling . all of these modes can be configured for different modes of work under Settings box ... &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the last letter of the input is removed and allows for the exec@@ uting list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump marks are inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of Edit jumping marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; setting Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; exec@@ utable settings can be made to these lists . there can be different converter lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as watch@@ straps of the general use of the language . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there always must be entered a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of the exec@@ utable mode will result in a large list with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the execution of the surroundings to perform . &quot;
&quot; when inv@@ oc@@ ating the processing mode over the menu , a complete environment or a key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient agreement can be continued in the simplest way and cli@@ cked by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be created . &quot;
&quot; setting Ki@@ le ; set up ... box ; exec@@ utable settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the watch@@ list of the exec@@ utable mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex , commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of rep@@ lic@@ as that are immediately replaced by a longer string . as an example of a crash list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the character L is entered and the word default mode is introduced over the volume of the menu , or the C@@ trl + Alt key , the character L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; big fans are not helpful for automatic handling . however , it has been found that many bugs in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all the already written wishes . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the box settings box ... Ki@@ le re@@ plen@@ ished . here , also the threshold value for displaying the full handling can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder . mode stands for the abbrevi@@ ation ( cooling ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be observed and taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools , and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to view the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are comp@@ iling groups in the menus , creating conversion and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the compilation of the source code for the viewer such as &amp; Ok@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 3 , using alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Start command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
a new project is being asked about the project project News Project .... In this context the following information is asked for the project :
&quot; when running the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ uting of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed across scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fin@@ alized and can still be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
the first thing to say is that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather declared system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents including a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not only a description of all the programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents supplied with &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; available , finding the right document is not always easy . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the big advantage is the search for package names or dru@@ mming . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ like systems available . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who are pursuing the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project aim and offer for many hours for the development of tools , which we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you can create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; sig is read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sign@@ atures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for every day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . thus , you get one ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ en section . if you have entered your signature , save it using C@@ trl ; S file Save or click on the disk symbol save . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then , you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails at home or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 necessary . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all call pile elements are listed here . the older the pile entry , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a call @-@ up entry in the shown list , the cursor in the main window is transferred to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file . &quot;

&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone working with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows me pro@@ c and how amazing it is . raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finish it ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the desired working folder , then leave the current folder . if not , remove the current folder and enter the folder in the other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time I started pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how useful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now there is a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , just let them select the current folder . if not , select the current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be vali@@ dated is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let it simply hit the current file . if not , delete it in the current file and select the file to be vali@@ dated using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select it &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . &quot;
&quot; Ja@@ well , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed should be selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then you simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er file . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can now benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait for anyone to use the power in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can find the plu@@ gins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements . more about this you can find below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start with the menu plu@@ gins Edit . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often , several people work on a project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniquely identify .
&quot; a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button as pushing . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears bold by which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s identity are important with regard to news and remarks . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to be created for the team leader when something is happening . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script to insert a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; note is simple . either the comment entry is selected from the Editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword is entered in a commentary area followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a designated member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member is , role a role in the project from the following possibilities : the respective area or sub@@ project lad@@ ders should be given the respective area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note inv@@ ali@@ date . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower@@ case tags : case @-@ sensitive of automatically inserted tags . normal / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of attributes : high / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optionally closing tags : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include option tags automatically : as above for all other tags , with the exception of the simple tags . &quot;
&quot; automatically update start and finish : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
&quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default preferences can be restored . &quot;
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . this setting here is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power ou@@ tage or crash during the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be previ@@ ewed either in the editor area or in your own opinion ( or documentation in a box leader ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the windows settings to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface has been changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning section provides control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more queries .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode . with regard to the different modes see . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the representation of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set into details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree should be opened automatically when editing and how deeply in a modification of the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means anything else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plu@@ gins are K@@ part applications from third party that can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application ; the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified the following :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented which enables various implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only one plugin is available providing support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Deb@@ u@@ gger plu@@ gins in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger Plugin check box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will trigger the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . output of this requirement is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger initi@@ ates the next instruction in the script , without entering into the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where if possible in functions and include it is corrected in error . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next as if there was not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better . &quot;
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bars . tag files are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editor window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever have . &quot;
&quot; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create tag XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ dialo@@ ges . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool gli@@ ders allow a fast insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag XML files . tag folders carry the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything else . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
put a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag may occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
&quot; speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each , att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty . &quot;
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy and closed properly .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but look &amp; &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is on the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check is only done when loading the tag@@ XML files into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
&quot; in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP is described ; over@@ load function . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; value &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; option &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; general &#93; version = Def@@ eat 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D information = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
an action can be created with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places : $ P@@ AT@@ H / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed . &quot;
&quot; % p@@ id : replaces the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for the control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods , a script can be used by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; input to the standard input . in the selection box input can be determined which is to be sent to the standard input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output . it can be specified what to do with the text written on the default output by setting the output box output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use , enable dialog &quot; &quot; Edit tag &quot; &quot; if available so that input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; in view of the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually as loose , st@@ amped , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will be a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it must be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
press the user button and continue with other tags so there are or confirm with OK to complete .
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust dialog via Settings tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by tasting all the symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; when new XML does not exist , it will create im@@ pedi@@ ments , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please fit your tool@@ bar ( s ) , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most not@@ orious expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like . this is why this chapter describes how to create a PHP ; Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , if anyone has already done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # items in the main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1 html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see the PHP and PHP documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , ... Basic syntax = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the shaft depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you mentioned in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at various points , there is an email sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are checked and made available only if our team is using them as correct and full of use for the publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you will be asked for your private PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can choose one . in the New Resources dialog , the input fields need to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start the up@@ loading with clicking OK . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , up@@ loading tool@@ bars , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in case of problems it warns and it can be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the information given by the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creating can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can start from the DT@@ D File menu and conver@@ ge a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
&quot; doc@@ type definition bar : the string that should appear in the ! doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to take full advantage out of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; using actions is all that is selected as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so they can use only those users personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the cart@@ on wheels with information and the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; you can right click the box with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document set , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete , or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area lead to a further context menu on the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse cursor , or open the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in various fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with cart@@ ou@@ chers stand for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload , or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . by clicking on the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit , or send it by email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands is opened regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; with it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system , directed to the content , allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , can be downloaded from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; documentation site , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this calcul@@ ator shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed enter all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , like any other ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here . &quot;
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ developed development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a stand @-@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why development , which has already developed it all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; thus to extend how they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; it allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be dramatically increased . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta execute ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ an@@ .org @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder only one error is reported .
&quot; convert when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ description , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first line to paste &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
switch to or out of the block sel@@ ector . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
loading and switching of the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries forecast or next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files are then copied to the project directory .
&quot; search the project directory for new files that could be there , allowing you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; attitudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project management . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you can find details . &quot;
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in Project Tools / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by means of settings , or you will be asked when requ@@ esting , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you would like to do that . &quot;
you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where any other can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or someone else has made and convert into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P need to be re@@ plen@@ ished , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting through the tool@@ bar is denied if that day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on it . if an activated plug @-@ in is activated , it de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
&quot; sel@@ ects the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; inst@@ ant@@ aneous switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching can sometimes need time or create un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window . &quot;
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affect any application that will use the K@@ HTML @-@ part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; posters ; you can find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change sequences .
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one , except one processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . if you have a server script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started from scratch , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection by credit . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the bun@@ ny , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profiles or using the keyboard short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to the top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . you can find more information about G@@ ub@@ ed . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; event configuration shows event actions in the sub@@ window event configuration and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was open . this behavior cannot be influenced at present . &quot;
&quot; in order to open another project , select Project Open ... from the Project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . open dialog project will appear and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project construction supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave similarly , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu of the right mouse button menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in memory and forgotten by the program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password stored on the record does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
&quot; the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a hazard . use it according to your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk so that it cannot be read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , that is , through simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , preferably stack@@ able using the tool@@ bar menu . the addition of tool@@ bars is treated below in the Add tool bar section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can be configured either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which other actions such as tool@@ bar can be removed , tool@@ bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bars can be configured , which can be displayed in the dialog where actions on these or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will additionally be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set actions to set actions .
&quot; templates are basically of document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for example the limitations that one provides for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use .
binary templates are usually included in documents by means of links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the template tree is available .
&quot; documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents , based on a template , but the same text area . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File as template save as local template ... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File &quot; &quot; Save as a local / project template &quot; &quot; as a template . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only into a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or fil@@ esystem tree . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right of the file tree or the project file tree view , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder will be saved , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can forward head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynamically using &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or connect with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on files included in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the main folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would basically disable templates in this path except it would appear explicitly . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for a whole presentation to be provided with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , by means of context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which sub@@ stitutes the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second , divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor , in which the performed changes in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing from V@@ PL ; view , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for quick calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used for the reduction of the hands of the hands , so that you can change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down . a click into the list allows the change of the content such as keywords on the name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . &quot;
&quot; the insertion of tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that the insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the Table Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style template can be followed .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode , orph@@ aned stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame with no path input . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded styl@@ istic template file names with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g folder , for example , a styl@@ istic template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , is possible to enter the following input : &quot;
&quot; in this command , it is checked in a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ face called QNAP or a given model name . &amp; eg ; template matches each QNAP &apos;s string containing the template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace specified in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is added : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
an requested stop point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will automatically be done when loading the first template using x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each cycle .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during merging .
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed rows , but I could not see what exactly changes within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could represent differences within a line and changes to white marks . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply paste it into the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the merge and merging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time show the expected result . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and speci@@ fies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 2 diff@@ user folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 diff@@ user folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
&quot; open dialog displays your selection and displays them next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; by selecting a folder , you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders . &quot;
&quot; when merging is enabled , the input field will be active and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
you can also drag and drop use : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut@@ out and inser@@ ting ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the character A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files , which is good to see in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line change is activated , the line is scored with dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording Output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; modified &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is turned off ! ! ! ( use the buttons sprin@@ kles to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group will then be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and a black bar appears on the left .
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in any marker you might copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Conf@@ lic@@ t conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the numbers or ignor@@ ing Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the right , high , down , page , page , beginning , end , string start and string end , Si@@ w as you are used to other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over @-@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merging columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already discussed in the section merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Up / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Up / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it must be differentiated between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , you must copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is checked , you will automatically copy it to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option because you might over@@ ride the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; new@@ line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a new@@ line @-@ feed character \ \ r \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line @-@ end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of most recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore it to the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed . on these systems , the knob pres@@ ets automatically an un@@ regulated color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , when the tab key is pressed , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press the input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual to the clip@@ board then . &quot;
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system .
&quot; when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines to be found in the source files . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when merging , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line delay &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others may be treated with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but then a white sign is treated . during merging this option must be disabled . in default this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; &apos; , &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then you better use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merging menu . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and conducting a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if this option is enabled , the top setting is used for all entries . &quot;
about the selection fields for the encoding appears a brief hint of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which code to use to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply turn out the less important windows . ( this option is in the menu menu . )
the comparison window ranks next to each other or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the menu menu . )
&quot; sometimes you look at the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge operation and uses the file name of the last source file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first hand over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use a few keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) .
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines . &quot; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ sets from one another . example :
&quot; instead of used , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / replace / release / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &quot; &quot; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for display and merge operation . other operations will only change the data that the line interval al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; programmers often have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder . &quot;
... make a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without really performing it .
... &quot; execute selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the file dialog .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the basis . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , a small message window informs about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ click on the object , or double @-@ click on the object . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the assembly action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; however , for identical entries the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . at folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then becomes yellow and later when it is old , red is red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the syn@@ cing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified , and if the option Synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... &quot; A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; when the files are merged and select the newer file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. While such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merging one file is processed after the other . you status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is chosen in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C , B is used as a destination , and B and / or B will be used as a target for syn@@ cing . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries : select directory merge to start / continue in the directory -@@ menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut key ) . to just merge the current element , select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all the entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merging window will open ( see the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to choose another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , these entries will not be merged again . even if merging is ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merging action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a default poin@@ ter marks a file . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; with links to the files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; with links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that if the option is enabled , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders using a slow network , it might be quicker to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the change date . there is no real comparison . it can be useful , for example , when the change date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file as action is suggested . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be renamed without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of single files , not just merging entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merging view stays visible to the merging of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch off the window divi@@ der with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly , without having to start the folder merging first . if you save the result , the status will be reset , and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path may be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked ( # - &gt; % 23 , space 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a link to a file or folder , then a file will always be taken as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; generally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , the input file is in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performed as part , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ st it comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or are going to go this way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default install configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor notices each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it &apos;s too much effort to create an own file format that might save that information . &quot;
&quot; you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after the removal of text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lines ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to emphasize differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; in order to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you must re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries will show that identical files are not copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ lies in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and end . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has the name and name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , Windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ space are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of the virtual work@@ space . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , and eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays the window with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is known ; in a 2x@@ N grid , appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row , which is very good for display later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows dialog settings to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must login as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you will need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users , such as artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding for new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting magni@@ fies &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor as a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you may &amp; K@@ mag ; to do this , make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ let mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still not able to identify the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you push the &amp; Shift ; press the button or the M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer into a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your inserted short commands to store files , open a new window , print , new@@ ads ( with the button document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and shrink &amp; etc ; . &quot;
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a screen magni@@ fier ; for this purpose use an area of screen to enlarge . this application is useful for a variety of people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; was developed by Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ us@@ er@@ s.@@ s@@ f.@@ net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click when the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while at the same place . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate dra@@ gging with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; may b@@ ypass the pain that occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain .
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain avoid@@ ance which occurs when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may differ for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can pull the drag with pressed mouse button . this way , you can pull the drag with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this residence time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied by the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mou@@ sec@@ lick leads out . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently shifting is enabled , the rotation @-@ field is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , the mouse button will wait before the mouse button is released again , if no moving of the mouse is done . &quot;
&quot; these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears ret@@ ar@@ ded , you can shor@@ ten the response time . open the sound &amp; multimedia center , select Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and click here the General tab . there is a slider sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at the moment to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings back to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the last press of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best way to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shift should be turned off first . if you then have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral constitu@@ ents of windows or on places in the browser window , which is not a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quick to see if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can stop by letting the mouse button exit . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under any other window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . by this , the status of the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor over where you want it . however , parking the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , where you want it . safe zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus , and the titles of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy and paste text to the clip@@ board , or perform any other action at which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only cause some problems . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this allows you to use the sound like a mouse click . you know exactly when the shift time starts when you are intelligent moving . later , you can use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click , but it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed ; this should already be the case with most systems . &quot;
the audi@@ ble mouse clicks functionality is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts briefly . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which are causing pain to the mou@@ ths of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ me users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences with the conversation history to speak again .
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text@@ book script . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word @-@ passing . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word @-@ passing . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have the right input , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the language output box , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possible kt@@ ts@@ d will be used as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be available on this page . the kt@@ ad@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text@@ pas@@ sage@@ buch menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the memory memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box closing the editing window for text pas@@ sage@@ way , you can specify whether the text@@ book script should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; the book is saved with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text@@ book script is not saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ way is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word passing . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the currently used dictionary for wor@@ rying . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right side , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads &amp; cap@@ tion ; then retri@@ eves the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text passages or adding books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the current memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the current memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the current memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by clicking on the smart left side and pulling the tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by clicking on the smart left side and pulling the tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably don &apos;t have the command for the voice output correctly or not fully typ@@ ed . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the language output command . ( see Settings dialog for language synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival free of charge and to further distribute it with no restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etts . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
/ usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / T@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input has to be switched on .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak , can print text through the computer . a list of pro@@ positions is already saved , which the user can always make new editions . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not contain any language synthes@@ izer . a language synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on the computer .

different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; when you click the tab card speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all already equipped speakers appear in this list . the preferred actors appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click this button to move the speaker to the list below . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; vote to choose from . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text . click on the box orders to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de . click on the tab card tab General to open this map . here , you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system is disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ton@@ m@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field activation is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears when reading automatically in the control bar system area , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can start text orders , cancel , stop and record . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the ticket orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab card tab , General and check there Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text of the displayed page . then check the text you want to read . then select the text that is to be read , and select text from the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can read text displayed . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that is to be read , and select text in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; s ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about what happened to you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file cap@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which belongs to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required for normal work .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited before it is sent to the program speech dispat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , in order to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the continued orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning will take preced@@ ence and hold the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed once the warning has been issued .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read about this .
the rest are simple text orders . any order you run from the card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output will be stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
&quot; string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or regular expressions , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; convers@@ ing ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; with subscri@@ ber selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card holder , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . si@@ eh@@ . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page . the processing is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the next setup dialo@@ gs will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; for the creation of string replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column consistency and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ bet column . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list . &quot;
click the button to view a list of languages . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; key at the click of a mouse .
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you must leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only copy copied . &quot;
&quot; the filter replacement filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if identical . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all the texts . &quot;
&quot; in the comparison of words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in package k@@ de@@ uti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card editor , or to a speaker with specific properties . for example , you can specify that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; gives a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied in case the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; set the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which uses language synthes@@ iz@@ ers to add K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice @-@ over@@ s API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and an option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; windows . start first in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; conversion filter , but with the use of the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone in order for S@@ able to work at all . you have to do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H can be found . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ed . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string release filter . see . &quot;

the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices which own a license .
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ hydr@@ with &amp; kt@@ ts ; find it in the folder kt@@ ts@@ d . furthermore , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ hydr@@ under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian , Sw@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language synthes@@ izer that can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for language synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of any other synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile &amp; t@@ ort , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech dispat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded from the source code archive or downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech dispat@@ cher works properly with your language synthes@@ izer . for this you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts used . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the device of speech dispat@@ cher is possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can leave sentence or replacement mode , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have created a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , it may be used , otherwise the best matching speaker is selected . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose a speaker , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the cart@@ on menu speaker to add , and to insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the card speaker device is displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . you will find details on the modules below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text passed to festival . in case of voices that are known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some control and display this grey , the voice you choose will not leave these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or click to click App@@ ly ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked , the program window is displayed by kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the preview . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight @-@ worked sentence . the or@@ ator ID corresponds to the ID column on the card holder . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or return with the buttons in this row . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ sh@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the respective audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ts , the necessary libraries can not load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50 free ; % corresponds to half and 200@@ 00 ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after reading the output of the screen reader , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the warning read .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room .
&quot; if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications where sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the conversation ; ma@@ iled when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot;
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected Custom Text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card holder as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All al@@ erts for application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button Save to save the noti@@ fications for the noti@@ fications in a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for selecting text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for the control of voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice used at the edition of SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ lt ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual phrases , since only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , since only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized or stopped and ab@@ ort , even if the language synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limits recognition filter will be set up automatically . you can modify the settings or add additional pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the device selection is to set up the selection of speakers . switch off the selection of the speakers , and select text to read . switch on the box selection , change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set has to be processed and not all the text block , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; then you can stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the language synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ton@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional ends , adding a tabl@@ ature sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( tab characters are removed from the text before the filter ) . note that the default pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter keeps the character set . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ rep@@ o ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the box selection tab , you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card holder ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of a configured speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , most likely to match the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other features . you can also place multiple markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding output , it is always used as a priority property . you rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the work environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default spokes@@ man button and then use the speakers closest to the following . &quot;

&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts . if the problem is not solved by G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , you may have to install G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may have a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time . when I add a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the AL@@ SA project website ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;

&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found on the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as festival Inter@@ active offer an adjustment for speed depending on the selected voice . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate the .x@@ s@@ l file of the HTML ; after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the subscri@@ ber speed . &quot;

in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for language synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) , the configure option for switching off shows the configure parameter , which causes the transition of the creation . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . &quot;
on Deb@@ ian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .

&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your language synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian votes , you must enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; -@@ distri@@ butions . search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from dic@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .
&quot; in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival für deutsche &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either a festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playing the bug fixes is not necessary , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then add the following lines to the festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m file . &quot;
&quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; german Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; &quot; german Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; &quot; german Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; &quot; german Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 votes do not work with I@@ MS German festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to give the language through festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice . get and install first Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then load Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into a matching folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable must be located in your P@@ AT@@ H .
load the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip into the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff language synthes@@ izer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can &apos;t adjust pitch , volume or speech speed with this language synthes@@ izer . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . search Fl@@ ite for the first time on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage language synthes@@ izer which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language synthesis is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it to the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; epo@@ s is a free , quasi @-@ language synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can adjust only the volume with this language synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr on the map speaker . select the Czech or Slovak language and epo@@ s T@@ TS language synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if the epo@@ s are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the program for the programs . enter an additional parameter for the programs . enter into a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , open @-@ source language synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java , you can &apos;t adjust pitch , volume or speech speed . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer that can be controlled on the command line .

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by choice of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package is designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after the installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempt to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the dealer selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and is best . by selecting the setting no @-@ again questions , the setting can be made permanent . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access the system management mode at the lower right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three hor@@ semen : &quot;
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be configured by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic selection , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are made for the system at the same time . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on your needs . switching on a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be enabled or disabled , depending on your needs . switching on an activated network device can be turned off by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .... &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if more than one network interface is available on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain input by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org requests , DNS will trigger this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the host name resolution editor allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed .@@ DNS records can be re@@ arranged in the list by selecting an entry and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down in priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button ... Add from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit .... &quot;
&quot; the list of commonly known calcul@@ ators describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address refer@@ enced for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , completed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of names known by name contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test available version of IP will replace in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the familiar machine has multiple alias names , press the Add multiple button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Def@@ ault Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes needs to be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm @-@ packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages with libraries and other applications are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this section does not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is given . &quot;
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently concentrating on the IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assign@@ able to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the Network Administrator the contact point , which provides a valid IP address or , if available , can be used by D@@ H@@ CP . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are located and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed in case of DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is another content specified in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is retri@@ eved by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the tape , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been resolved and displays a message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires you to format it , it must happen before you format it . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the strap . all the data on the band are lost ! after the format@@ ting process , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save as ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check once again the selected files and change settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Check ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog &apos;s Settings dialog appears . in this dialog , you can check your sel@@ ections once more and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the recovery , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog &apos;s Rest@@ oration dialog appears . in this dialog , you can check your sel@@ ections once more and change the work@@ folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will be restored . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ files based on the tape content . this process cle@@ ars all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this will create a safety profile with just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work@@ folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system , like the folder . folders that are located on other file systems , can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered to be tar @-@ independent from others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; s ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the belt device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is involved , the load is loaded onto the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the cast in the tape drive . it may not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , it is automatically ej@@ ected when the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option in flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to tell &amp; dat ; in any case , let the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should cover only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is the name of the band name : seconds , where the name is the complete name of the system on which the band was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the epoch in which the band was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system lays down the various protocol files .
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start is tried &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of all the system log file - the system protocol - will open . if this is not shown to you , then you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not run with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log file , for normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter line to the filter bar . the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed , if one of the columns contains the string of the filter search term . &quot;
&quot; you can , of course , select another entry on this site . for example , in the log file system log , select the process column , and also enter the name of a process in the filter strip , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as protocol @-@ lines of level hint . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off setup dialog .
&quot; for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the option to skip to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new protocol rows . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming a standard for controlling program start @-@ up at startup of the system in &amp; Linux ; world . because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I do not know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone might attempt to move a machine to System V In@@ it without a re @-@ installation and format@@ ting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will be started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be located on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , which has to do with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . in the beginning you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change it , then you can repair it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script is called up with the stop argument . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user running level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; start . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another timer is easy to say not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will not be removed from its original running level ( or its position ) .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tabl@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the various work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tabl@@ ul@@ ator button to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by clicking the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default is taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have planned some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are required ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without message when their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adju@@ st@@ ment of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . the dialog appears user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have enabled extended system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , will create a map on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; the tab card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; this card can only be activated and initi@@ alized ( dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the restrictions of space in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation .
&quot; the groups group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog Properties of the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , tick this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , add the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
