<seg id="14">"each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView, the size of a file reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. therefore, the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. therefore, & FSView can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation, a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful hue and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for the easy detection of the shutter depth or the representation of a different file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation or if the area of subordinate rectangle is to be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always maintained. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, it is up to the implementation to be left to the extent that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive branches."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimal displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList have no pictures as symbols."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can in & digikam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favorites to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it may be possible to handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw footage in the Help menu aid Rohkamerabackup."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh-Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digicam; albums can be downloaded via gphoto2. of course, any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together."</seg>
<seg id="74">"modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact & Flash, memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is then used as disk drive. the camera can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232)."</seg>
<seg id="75">"Photo2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is outdated in the meantime. & digicame; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to read the thumbnails reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about & digicame; is how easy his functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digicame;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview to develop. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digicame; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes were made in & digicame; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the tree, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in key words, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the icon view. thus, the filter works on the file name only if this icon is displayed. which fields are displayed, you can configure the settings in the AlbenSettings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; displays an organized view on your photo albums. all photos that were created by & digicame are stored in a single album tree, after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date on which the album was first created, sorted. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have a scanner set up, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to provide information about this collection. to access the album properties, right-click on the album and select the album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album Collections: are a method to highlight your albums so you can group them under a common name. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums After date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the Elders" buttons, average, new testers: these set the date on the oldest, the latest image or the section of the album. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder. "</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first open an album in & digicame, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"in order to select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select" "Default" "in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be wasted.</seg>
<seg id="95">The collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window displays the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifiers in the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="99">The thumbnails feature help windows that appear. the help shows the most important features including all the key features of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows one such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">"photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as you like. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can choose from the view of the images, a slide show or editing the pictures."</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image Edit... or selecting the contextual menu of the image using the right mouse button and Edit.... image processing can be found in the editing section. image editing can be used to view photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">"you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of the file. to do so, and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not enumerated, you will find information in the & kde; manual."</seg>
<seg id="103">"some programs do not store this data if you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc."</seg>
<seg id="104">The easiest way is to right-click the preview and select turning. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">"to change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;)."</seg>

<seg id="108">"if you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days."</seg>
<seg id="109">"photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again."</seg>
<seg id="110">"when a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="111">"tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. thereby, you can organize your keywords logically. you can also fold up parts of the tree & quot; My Keyword listequot; fold up, so that you can find the keywords you are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs."</seg>
<seg id="113">"you can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keywords, or selecting a keyword, and then select a new keyword. if you add a new keyword after you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword."</seg>
<seg id="114">"you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo."</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword keyword in the keywords. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">"in order to select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this can be done in two ways: as soon as you have selected the photos you want with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also right click on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword (s) from the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="119">"you can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made etc."</seg>
<seg id="120">"once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear in the main window to preview the image."</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Delete menu. the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">"the timeline view shows a time-based adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window."</seg>

<seg id="132">"& digicame; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas."</seg>
<seg id="133">"similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar. by means of a swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from anywhere on the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then this will open and you can drop it there."</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hands-free sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the right pictures. also here a threshold value can be placed.</seg>
<seg id="135">This rider provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out or hold it out. move it to a square with the mouse wheel. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this naturally requires that your images contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for a later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>

<seg id="138">"select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl. the selection will be added to the light table and opened its window. if you are back in & digitized; main window, you can quickly open the light table with L Extras LED."</seg>
<seg id="139">"from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and drop them there. if you select to synchronize from the toolbar and perform the zoo or shift operations on one of the pictures, you will also be able to compare the same area of the two images."</seg>
<seg id="140">"another mode is better suited to order quickly from a picture series. if you use combination-wise navigating from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas of the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar pictures."</seg>
<seg id="141">"of course, the normal soldering actions work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file Edit...."</seg>
<seg id="142">"all image information from the right-hand sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnail images. this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data, for example."</seg>
<seg id="143">"in the bottom end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the image, you need to click on it and hold the & LMB. in the Preview mode, both images will show the same image area."</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works as much as in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into and out. this happens in both pictures if you are previewing in the mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">"digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or stores digital photos carries a form of digital stock management. most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way."</seg>
<seg id="146">"we will provide you with a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images, find, protect, download and use photos. we will focus on the processes for digital photographers using the & digicam. we consider the download, rename, remove, value, archive, archive, optimize, maintain, maintain, maintain, maintain, maintain, maintain, maintain, maintain, maintain and export image files."</seg>
<seg id="147">"& quot; Digital Inventory takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, transformed, confectioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value."</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">"if you don't even know how many photos you have, then don't use it. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then don't use it. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digicame;. the approach can store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files and secure archiving to which you can access other programs, platforms and formats."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the first thing you do and need to know before you have something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point."</seg>
<seg id="151">"maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found over your location unless you are in a year at the same place. if you take enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website."</seg>

<seg id="301">"the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when white balance is not set. default is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the standard is the pointed-lights, so the parts of your pictures are burned in the settings, because of the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings. the setting colors will trigger some unusual results, since they display the top lights in various rosettes. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the highlights."</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digicame; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">"when selecting the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore / should be individually adapted for each image."</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable variance from the actual scanned or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">"the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should provide you with detailed background information about color management. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so you can get the desired result."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image issues are via email or the web, where sRGB is de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB limits compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colours we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibriate my monitor if I decided to work just in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you work in the sRGB color space or not, you must callibriate your monitor since sRGB is callibriated. the callibrization of your monitor closes the circle. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic levelling and Contrast extend from the Correct Automatic correction menu to automatically try to make the best of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the luminous strength over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade."</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method juts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracle effects or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast increases: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a re-aging of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited since about a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adjusted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top right, a histogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels are very small luminance values. the sum is called Luminanz."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade adjusting allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or dimming down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Load do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance that you have set can be saved to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save them your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is to be found in the menu under color sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same corrections."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under paints gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digicame; tool color effects provide you four color effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect that resulted in a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and afterwards the development of the image completed. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar power effect. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the intensity applied is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so-called" Velviaquot "effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for a colour-optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot, and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can look at the different color levels of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if the result you like, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous strength / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound value correction for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the application purpose explained here. more specifically the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into the inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls and to keep track of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right-hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the image's settings, and the following options are available on the left-hand side."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digicame; puts three different tools available for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">"the same phenomenon can be observed when printing ink points on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when printing ink points on paper. normally, SLR cameras usually require longer-term sharpness than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used in internal sharpening. however, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter already while reading the image. if you deactivate this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this can be done using the corrective sharpening menu."</seg>
<seg id="487">"in general, the sharpest technique is increasing the edge of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is refocusing the tool. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening under refocusing."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much simpler than it is to sharpen. use the tool to draw a little soft drawing, and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. if you make the blurred mask strong, noise and the impression of grates will be created near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is one like many pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, you can define a minimum difference with it for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpness and hence flaw errors in faces, skies and water surfaces avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted defission filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the gauss'sche fold. the Gauß'sche fold has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"use this parameter if your blurry is' sch '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameters you have set will be saved later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unfavourable artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp mask produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp mask to use a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"even under optimal conditions, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the field correction methods in digital images, you can find a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothes the blurring of the area which has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can set this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool for removing unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labor in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">"this tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration, and the available presets are listed below:"</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should be given details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alpha [0,100]: a little value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie set or CCD noise, a high value wavy pattern will produce. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. usually here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle stepwise [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles can produce a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated walking distance [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low, but it doubles the runtime."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. to correct any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors can be corrected quite quickly at work. however, it can take a very long time and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with Kleine Artefakte. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicame; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that occur e.g. of dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the picture."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. if it is increased, noise tips will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubricate occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: checks the edge accuracy of the filter. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it is not possible to remove the entire noise or rocket tips. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminous density: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve your image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve your image. these settings do not affect the smoothening process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamut tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more corrosive."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is on its minimum, noise and phasenjitter appear on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little softly is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use the tool for softening soft markings and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adjusted to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. the smoothing takes place along the contours of the image and thereby gets the content as it does the human eye."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the thickness of the second degree distortion. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion fourth grade. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">"zoom: this value is scaled to scale the image size, resulting in a correction of first degree. negative values increase while positive the image is smaller."</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as default values."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the spherical or cushion-shaped correction should be performed prior to all trimming or size changes. best perform this correction first. if you recut a picture and after that perform a tonal correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the spherical / cushion distortion with the help of the lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them from the editing tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or via the zoom knob of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>

<seg id="592">"below the Preview, you can adjust the granular texture of a highly sensitive film if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, since the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filesystem applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is set under (1) and the modified image (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the highlights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the digicam filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed movies, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photoemulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy look especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, then you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the processed (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>

<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around one center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how you can blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transform size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>

<seg id="655">"the Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the gold spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"when you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographer. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options are mirrored and vertical can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>

<seg id="918">"before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objective. in the following, each section is described more precisely."</seg>

<seg id="920">"next, select if a & kphotoalbum; -export file is to be created on the overview page."</seg>
<seg id="921">"finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that all images are displayed by a party. note that all images are displayed by a party. note that all images are exported at the moment. therefore, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unambiguous, which is why this is not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so, you can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, search. if it wants to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best select a base folder for all of your HTML files, and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>

<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created, should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to copy them manually. to make the import function, see, correctly works, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the root folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings you have just described have been related to all three root folders or URLs. in this, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you're on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time looking at the pictures, location, etc., then you have to go with & kphotoalbum; do not make this work again."</seg>

<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and pass this file independently. the obvious downside, however, is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kim file searches the images in a twofold manner. first, it searches the images that are located in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, this is only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export File menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>

<seg id="939">With the Automatically Copy to the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is limited to maximum image size. if you send your friends pictures, you may not want to send the pictures in full size since the .kim file would otherwise be very large."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is called by your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window which categories should be imported to the import file and which categories correspond to them in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to import with the categories of your current database. see an example for this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">"it has to be easy to browse images and view: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>

<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be followed individually and further under review. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn on, change & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order, nor leave any line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (a gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here, the term drum patch is meant to represent another percussioning instrument (drum, tank, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to depict sounds on the percussion channel. see the included Keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to another. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"in this case, if you use the keymap option, the keymap must be defined forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which proportion pitch-bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-bender event, then it is redirected to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal commas are standing)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM states that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-bender event with the value of 4096, will play a ton higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you will find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button no longer lights green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notorious expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like. this is why this chapter describes how to create a PHP; Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if anyone has already done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language."</seg>

<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see the PHP and PHP documentation:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Getting Started,... Basic syntax = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the shaft depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">"spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced."</seg>

<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you mentioned in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at various points, there is an email sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; -users can download them. the contributions are checked and made available only if our team is using them as correct and full of use for the publication."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading you will be asked for your private PG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event you have several keys, you can choose one. in the New Resources dialog, the input fields need to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and start the uploading with clicking OK."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) menus, uploading toolbars, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; in case of problems it warns and it can be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the information given by the author of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus. however, creating can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tagXML format. there is the easier way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can start from the DTD File menu and converge a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folders.</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to take full advantage out of & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus; using actions is all that is selected as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so they can use only those users personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the carton wheels with information and the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can right click the box with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document set, reload, delete, or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editor area lead to a further context menu on the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tag under the mouse cursor, or open the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in various fields in a dialog."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the building manviews (QIT;) enable you to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with cartouchers stand for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, upload, or delete files from the storage medium can be performed with the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on how they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you will find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script. by clicking on the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit, or send it by email."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands is opened regarding navigation and refresher of the tree."</seg>

<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed rows, but I could not see what exactly changes within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktts; filters are not required for normal work.</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand the working method of filtering, it is important to know how the program" speech dispatcher "works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of screen reaers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the continued orders are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning will take precedence and hold the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed once the warning has been issued.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website you can with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also messages. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order you run from the card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reads, this output will be stopped and terminated."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reavers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or regular expressions, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversing; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to a different format. in delivery of & ktts, some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"with subscriber selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sends the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card holder, you can read text from KDE messages about it. sieh. read about it."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"when a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page. the processing is done in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & gt; s; and lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>

<seg id="2936">"the format of this string is the name of the band name: seconds, where the name is the complete name of the system on which the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the epoch in which the band was formatted."</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system lays down the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"furthermore, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information on problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot shows & ksystemlog; functions are available, with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can easily be filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start is tried & ksystemlog; first of all the system log file - the system protocol - will open. if this is not shown to you, then you have & ksystemlog; most likely not run with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log file, for normal users usually do not have permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter line to the filter bar. the list of the log lines will be displayed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed, if one of the columns contains the string of the filter search term."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can, of course, select another entry on this site. for example, in the log file system log, select the process column, and also enter the name of a process in the filter strip, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as protocol-lines of level hint. the colored representation of protocol-lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the Samba server, you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can use the option to skip to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new protocol rows."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is quickly becoming a standard for controlling program start-up at startup of the system in & Linux; world. because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I do not know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone might attempt to move a machine to System V Init without a re-installation and formatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from BSD Init, that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort can find rc.sysinit and the following folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which will be started only once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be located on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, which has to do with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change it, then you can repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script is called up with the stop argument. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user running level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; start."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another timer is easy to say not trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or move the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will not be removed from its original running level (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tablulator button to activate the various work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tablulator button to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by clicking the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default is taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have planned some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are required (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without message when their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter Adjustment of & kuser."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. the dialog appears user and group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only displayed if you have enabled extended system settings. only if you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, will create a map on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unix."</seg>
