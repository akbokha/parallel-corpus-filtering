&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalists because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who wanted to occupy the su@@ ici@@ dal plot of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admir@@ ation for the US .
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you can always be the one you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very shy love letter written about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his opinion , he never keeps behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number , which received a candidate nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person I asked myself ?
I could not associate Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; such as my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which takes people from all over the world , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; also , Tru@@ mp Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tru@@ mp intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped to get used to the complexity of the American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew Tast@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp made his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t vis @-@ à @-@ vis non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
that is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom know , have voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who look differently from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . D. : as much as &quot; The white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; the word game of white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have always , America is welcome to everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ans , whose history , as he says himself , would be nowhere else in the world possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mps there is , however , a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der .
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tru@@ mp Land , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t spoil their love for music through garbage

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; the fact that the music played at both locations not only changed the life of the children , but also has a very close relationship with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the village : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 pupils became a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its use of drugs and gangs of violence . &quot;
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come out of the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that lies practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chá@@ vez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music by the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chá@@ vez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning : &quot;
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something , which he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash made of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; today there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; Land @-@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot;
&quot; every year , the world generates about one billion tonnes of waste . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa visited . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind at their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to fire one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden , the prime minister is surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; says Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the NGO stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y Stop ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who then expelled the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and join each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard for existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news of suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea , by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships fishing in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious voy@@ ages can be discovered - such that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the go to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a catch license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm which advoc@@ ates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $ 20 million in lost sales , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; such practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , fla@@ vor@@ ing names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You can &apos;t run my port . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to Me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found refugees .
&quot; based on his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross through , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different levels of information . it is said to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by the position of each individual trac@@ eable vessel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what &apos;s doing , &quot; he says . &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that used to fish previously without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , their use was prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries are also notic@@ ing these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we are now also copying other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are an object of study . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , hundreds of millions of dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Safety is the goal of building even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; just recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia got its first great triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . and not only the ship was on the go without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually functions throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of re@@ covering &quot; the country &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the presi@@ dency of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after Venezuela &apos;s government rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , re@@ acted on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. the return or@@ estation of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the district of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , located in the central @-@ northern Bun@@ de@@ state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the im@@ itation of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the continuation of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( e.g. : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , called upon the demonstr@@ ators to join the majority of representatives of the opposition . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; as far as Venezuela is concerned : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike , and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images , which tell about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the central @-@ north @-@ located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and the government &apos;s armed pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not carry skir@@ ts , because you could see anything else , what many National Gu@@ ards do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already accounts for the extent of the suppression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial thread , which was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets . &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s for this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your revival !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and preferred to om@@ it critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches tend to increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano now , as part of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba , declared against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself . &quot;
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t see back then that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer , and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in La Per@@ la prison until 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified against a German court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the Sports Hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I went to the sports hall often . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
&quot; all named him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .

&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
only notice that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I must then save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina . &quot;
that &apos;s why he banned me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would be a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be fine . &quot;
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great lum@@ ps of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were turned off and chat@@ ted with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a couch where men were tortured . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached to it the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was bound there .
&quot; she un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it out with water and drove him to the gen@@ itals a charge of 220 vol@@ ts . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were bound to bind them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were bound by hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people were quietly lying on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me back ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the information of survivors , the civilian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was indic@@ ted by the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the de @-@ human@@ ization process . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; Battle of War &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war of war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I became aware that martial arts are bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military signs that one takes off an enemy that one has fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if you go to a house and put the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als then that is not war @-@ be@@ aver , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded rage , and struck me , crying out : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; for this , we need no one else ! &quot;
this is my Father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; back then , the defence accused me of having been a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel regret . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one evol@@ ves further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why did the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why do children ab@@ duct ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I reck@@ on , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families to whom one could give their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced , they picked up machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and lost somewhere - no idea where . &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to show my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
then he said suddenly : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he just replied &quot; &quot; Well , then I &apos;m showing me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally testified against my own father .

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in K@@ YO@@ TO where you can extend your driving license .

editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend their driving license , in the last month , witnessed a particularly mis@@ placed translation . &quot;
&quot; on one sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; the &quot; older driver &quot; means , fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with a malicious rear @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine shared in the social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who drew attention to the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could there be such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the correct English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( of the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are due to the police . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors made 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors rose in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the particularly un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light published on the Yahoo version of the article , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo about translation errors has among other things received the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this the ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So wrong is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a true translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all over Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills , to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation , cost @-@ reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that do not have foreign employees , nevertheless make translations available in the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions , which arise through machine translation , show that this technique can be replaced by no human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling im@@ prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship actions on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ it@@ ters also took over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organised by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on demonstrations , as the Commission looked at this as a &quot; &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national television channels .
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNA . this is a technique through which the DNS servers en@@ quiries about certain domains fail to respond correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds faulty or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who had performed the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live in prison . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been informed that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage more and more difficult in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house , where she worked for years . &quot;
&quot; today Tina fights for the rights of children and ga@@ thers witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were exactly as they became victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a draft report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride she spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she who has become of something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness statements , researched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who have their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who receives the girl with himself and justi@@ fies his exploitation by faith , justi@@ fies that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have been given no training and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mal@@ treated , his family will be experienced only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never even experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military man Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , who were deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , were responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to inj@@ ure the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to sign up for bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work now and began selling sweets on the street or market , in order to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
she had to share the time so that she was still learning to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , it cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they still had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as a food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the master , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some end , the master Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to not give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; again . &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible to lose .
&quot; she was , however , completely clear that she had paid for all she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in the school . &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment to which Cri@@ adi@@ ta are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I particularly felt that I was not a group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please tell us .
starting from Monday if possible .
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; &quot; was written . &quot;
then the author of the display split once again :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll look if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í , and their &quot; wives , &quot; were subjected to their &quot; wives &quot; ) . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the view posed by power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users social media to register with the government
&quot; picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted on a draft bill to &quot; regulate the use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is asked to use citizens to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and personnel ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and classified in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is run over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose the registration . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , reported to the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of it , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as they forci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take her seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a law@@ suit . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be deb@@ ated with Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y appointed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long sentence for those destined to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest &quot; &quot; was found guilty . &quot;
how a Kurdish prot@@ ector protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards from Iraq in the war

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal trainer H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predat@@ or present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes towards zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country that is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region are set up .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the progress made for Nor@@ theast Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , has been making progress in the last six years to revi@@ ve the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which lies in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a regional pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate neighbour@@ hoods were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , just because of that , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from the local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of those affected .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the closing light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ shel@@ fe ( the bank of the river , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) moved to final sub@@ stitu@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelter shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , more and more than 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ees still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees , who were home after the disaster in accommodation , were moved to final homes . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , have again opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are still in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agr@@ arian land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have attracted large @-@ scale battles in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ land by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered extensively , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it feels more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to establish an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in the case of disaster prevention . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also a witness to the worst , disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent spare @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees still live older than 50 years old . it is known because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive building projects . these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 . &quot;

&quot; when people from other countries talk about another language , the differences seem to be greater at first than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is still very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had struck him with a blow on his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás has suffered a skull trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus spreading rapidly within a few days in Brazil .
the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o by the police officer .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from the active ministry until the end of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officer , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officer would beat a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video made by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer , and several medi@@ ators soon hurry to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also sur@@ faced in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police over@@ take
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only country in Brazil , where there was a brutal police force against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen were among the protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , a rubber bul@@ let and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by ste@@ aling the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window in order to make their titles illustr@@ ative with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set fire on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines entitled &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages in Cuba that have been forgotten by the de @-@ induc@@ ing
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba closed doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the rest , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is standing up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories located in the east of the region , which after a long period of in@@ active time are in operation again because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene recalls exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are no longer new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will surely go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word that he is most repe@@ ats is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially published documents , which were only distinguished in relation to the parts which would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all of them were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over@@ shad@@ owed and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot; he assured .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; against his will , he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most sophisticated industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the workplaces and services generated by the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the President of the time , who then saw President in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would be well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the folk congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to disgu@@ ise them , they also ceased to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ es other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to locate other factories . &quot;
they became sub@@ stitutes .
&quot; without a promising perspective , many young people left the region at once . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , the production of which is not even used for the supply of the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o per month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement at the age of 65 , not because it is lacking in strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , mobile audio studios have been part of schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;

&quot; the workshop starts with the young participants in talks like &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved got help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a stop@@ gap in dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well a translation into English , which is translated here into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and as our youth go forward
so they can do what they have ordained for the Creator

in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
&quot; in order to show potential customers exactly what is on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( gar@@ land , &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers look at these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the city of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a lot of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic geri@@ es decorated cell phone bands as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , we also offer rice st@@ ables ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more bizarre plastic dishes , check out : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which dedic@@ ates itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . like the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug traffi@@ ckers &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and tested regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the trau@@ mas or the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning with Drug Tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is intended to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project in such a way :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ ph@@ ews on one single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task we have placed , to go and look for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
&quot; on October 15th , he was to be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her out , because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where are we to get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we need not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader from Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensation journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; I am coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from professionals . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old cous@@ in thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
the in@@ action of people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; open @-@ minded . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and quiet .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed by their business , like a family with threats , until they destroyed the business in the end not only the business , but also tore their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain over it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because you do not know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
&quot; in these aw@@ ful days , I asked myself if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist , Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega , published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ent Generation . &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , violence through organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the public security council and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched Nar@@ co@@ data &apos;s data journ@@ alism project , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important at a moment when it comes to expos@@ ing a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to capture trage@@ dies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; wrong description &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; false context &quot; &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions to our desire for pictures of messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the lor@@ ry fell victim to the truck . &quot;
&quot; authorities have described a fire@@ ball , which covered dozens of houses including cinema near , full of people who watched the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ red corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of sh@@ red@@ ded bodies lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to actual trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses had reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated on the basis of satellite images .
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict ther@@ mic between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo re@@ appeared as it wrong@@ ly presented evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ fortun@@ es ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; even one step further brings personal comments , such as this example fal@@ sely , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash reservation , published by the United Nations , those who escaped could flee , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , wrong@@ ly claimed to President Burma &apos;s Th@@ ein , monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image of the DR Congo to capture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein Sein to this statement , but had not taken the picture of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private pages , social media platforms and national and national publications , and are in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have re@@ directed wrong reports , some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , on the basis of which they had been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been joined together ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be fully retri@@ eved ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .

&quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only fal@@ si@@ fication , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known if the original report contained the picture ) .

&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ bites after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly have not seen any pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ sters that refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo was a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government issued a right to judge what they came up with as &quot; pur@@ ported news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this adjustment , which has only been published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors operating H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and the other way ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; F@@ athers р@@ и@@ с@@ т@@ и@@ а@@ я &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DRC does NOT show Muslims that Christians kill . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news @-@ page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar held Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it represents a &quot; &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns to sleep the world ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , appeared and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve that their communities were paying a greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message , which was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be fal@@ si@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in Gra@@ u ) but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ mes ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second questionnaire uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and repro@@ aches the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy . at times , these images are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing readers and spectators and taking them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent medi@@ ums work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggest@@ ing something , which can actually be used by the context or completely impro@@ per type . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find , for example , words from the German VAT language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Stu@@ d your parents in recognition of how they have tried to keep you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ y other cultures , col@@ li@@ de other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very much appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite destinations here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge winds . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children warns after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; this morning , the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also flooded due to the waterfall of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are being completed to transport emergency supplies to the residents locked in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app in order to inform the Kat@@ o@@ zo@@ ic Center .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people involved in floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide assistance . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we vote for trans@@ gender rights . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others say slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective presentation that as soon as Muslims , who like me do not fit there , become Muslim . &quot;
de@@ mus@@ sti@@ ti@@ zing of the muscles
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western vision , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid in the 1970s sh@@ ook the story behind these images .
but these pictures still continue to stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dec@@ eive them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rations dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries in the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
&quot; it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ cans , which were brought in with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ mic attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we are more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations that will help us understand the world .
and my industry has f@@ ain@@ tly failed to grasp the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re @-@ thinking the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were unavoid@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or wearing my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims wear - &quot; &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we do not carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ d@@ eity with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ sc@@ arf . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I am a Muslim when looking through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , if I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and call it the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one who can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim sen@@ timent is always a part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters in the 1960s . &quot;
approved use .
&quot; belonging to my grandmother is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as they , decades ago , gain a contest of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they said to me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be a Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ised for centuries by an &quot; empire &quot; colonial , which has established a company called Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , the family he was not allowed to close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was dump@@ ed over a Muslim country in a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub @-@ tan of the British empire , was described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled in more parts of the world as I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it is to remind that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , had gone to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy visits the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was sum@@ mon@@ ed by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist means to fail to communicate the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ stric@@ ted lines , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced duality &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this doubt . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries that are bombing it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we throw down on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell we are here today .
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ed to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous im@@ prints that we deal with in our news reports . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global point in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me a Muslim today . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread crust track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story is l@@ ur@@ king where someone is being made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia take place . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where there was Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were en@@ um@@ er@@ ated by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public performance , four decades ago even scientific of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously , in which we have no pres@@ idents who feed chocolate cake while he has already broken up countries and &quot; &quot; other made &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , is telling stories in their original language a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and honor the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while &quot; &quot; listening to it often is connected to understand &quot; &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and their representation are leading to the fact that the audience is involved in it . &quot;
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the story t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ ug@@ ati is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative tours . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ onal test of debt ) and the ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ tical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ determination of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities who are responsible for the debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in the public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; Night@@ guard for Light and Truth &quot; . &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that will be held in Berlin , an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective Inves@@ tig@@ ations ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the true costs associated with this .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information whatsoever about its present state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book , entitled Collec@@ tive Memory , gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process from time to time extreme convic@@ tions ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in charge of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command from his prison cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government and noted them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
&quot; however , its place of residence and state remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and mom@@ entary director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ tide &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pres@@ cient than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around the year 2005 , to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this move to digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he has taught other prisoners , to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained . &quot;
&quot; for one year , Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book . &quot;
they smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ourselves , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers does not matter to me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot;
if your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
&quot; to get all the moments back , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el :
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
&quot; Mozambique : due to corruption , the director returned to previous post after release &quot;
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants , were sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money was from public funds from Mozambique airports , the Council of which took over Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer back to its old post , as the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many people do not expect the promotion to be good . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , has condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the company : &quot;
&quot; it represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a step back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the acc@@ users .
&quot; however , the company seemed to be silent , causing no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; illegal &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half had eaten . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t harm . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not say any morality : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that one re@@ compens@@ ates someone who has already insul@@ ted the state in such a massive way .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return mor@@ ale and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a matter of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , to remind him that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el prison not only to be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp and sharp one and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
&quot; one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years away and released . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he lost money , sets it up again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ angel@@ ic fin@@ k ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 . may 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo of the journal @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( in German : @ Truth ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; in fact , to be in # Mozambique th@@ ief and servant of # F@@ rel@@ imo , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , for a long time in prison , returns to # airports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ sam@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
&quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; dol@@ drums &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar may normally be associated with racism today , but the word in itself does not automatically evoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored for their use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical , before it den@@ ies any posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the campaign may send a strong signal to anyone who would like to spread the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is ban@@ ished :
... &quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete posts , posts and parts for 24 hours because the Post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply attempt to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author informed his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work so . &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will bring only more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have thus banned words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a lot of sales , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of der@@ ision among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun on Facebook and consciously do not write the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; in the context of hate speech , to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have no hate speech but were removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
only to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post is &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Hass@@ sprache in social networks should add to the violence in the congregations in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to bring out hate speeches on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; , &quot; it would have been better to look at context as focused on code , and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an excuse for children
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously decided on a law to ban the practice so that the age of hei@@ gh@@ tened age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , met a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not interfere , as that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN @-@ child rights convention , which defines the min@@ ors as , every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; the statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that endea@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without doubt they helped to bring this result .
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children , they were supposed to be dam@@ ned for their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and eventually doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft bill against the children before was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
&quot; after having previously been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws for children before had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost every price worth it . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the matri@@ mon@@ ial network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , has said quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law : &quot;
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft amendment was adopted today on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the voting .
all parliam@@ ent@@ arians who oppose the law have voted for the law .
the child before is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ care ag@@ ei@@ tor@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj declared his intention to take judicial steps , the law was to be passed and it seems to redeem his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act contrary to the law , most social media users wished to go out of the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about the fact that we , the state in our bedroom , would simply talk about the fact that the state , our daughters , would be mis@@ used to prevent them from mis@@ use , &quot; &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different grades , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit . &quot;
h@@ acker ste@@ aling the office of the prosec@@ utor in front of national protests at the Russian National Day
screen print of the message posted on Sunday morning on the Public Prosecutor &apos;s website by the district of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l .
&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s Day - the Russian National Day - the website of the Prosecutor of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was h@@ ack@@ ed . h@@ ack@@ ers have left a wit@@ ty message &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y at home . &quot;
or we bring you into prison instead of Dim@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; &quot; on the website of the prosec@@ utor with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the office of the prosec@@ utor calls on citizens not to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the page - however , it remained in the cache . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the office of the prosec@@ utor told the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; through the mirr@@ oring of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally shad@@ owed . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day more clearly how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV shows defend themselves against the barrier .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , several mirrors pages ( pages , which reflect the content of Wikipedia , are frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine @-@ computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the legal prohibition , the content is retri@@ ev@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we did everything to remove snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content on decentr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ deb@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees of Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
you get access to a different URL which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server manages the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . &quot;
the motivated man himself was able to wear a camera and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot;
&quot; he described on Facebook , how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to break pictures ! !
&quot; Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to co @-@ operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition of N@@ ept@@ une nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , because he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face , &quot;
a tiger cannot be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . &quot;
&quot; in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at Bar@@ dia National Park shots of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ Prosecutor and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version has been re @-@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , get this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false dish and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community , after calling on a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives , also not called by the name , is common among men . however , they have far fewer assignments to fear , if any , they should not come after this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health staff and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the exploitation of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to ban@@ ishing HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who did not call her husband by name .
she decided on this topic because she wanted to open a conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; not speaking al@@ oud by the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they have perpet@@ u@@ ated and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini comments :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name of her , wanted to try out at home as she did . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ at &quot; &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition , in which married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise it was only gi@@ g@@ gling ; another decided to release the whole frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law looked at her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead indicating the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not completely ceased , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small it occurs . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most things this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of stri@@ fe and discussion about the advantages of your own dress code , the morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , smu@@ g@@ gled Roh@@ ini your own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot;
next they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly moving into roles : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only made small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tried it a couple of times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lies at the end of a river difficult to navigate .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

&quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; says Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the Retail Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
&quot; today , Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day . &quot;
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .

&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese , of course , also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , that is your 5 places you must definitely visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )

good morning together .
&quot; today , Beat@@ les Day is a memorial day . &quot;
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community , such as these R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could this be for a day ?

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that gl@@ amor@@ ous men could be target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of crew members for organ trafficking , probably for isolated purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently used to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a glorious man &apos;s gold could reveal or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on smooth @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , aimed at assass@@ ination for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN launched a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where government campaigns developed to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the police police after the latest assass@@ inations of three gl@@ amor@@ ous men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the mur@@ ders took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the men of gl@@ utt@@ ony .
&quot; the persecution and assass@@ ination of gl@@ utt@@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably dev@@ out rituals , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exist , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the wealth generation . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems in this part of the country were murdered . &quot;
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty to which Mozambique is facing :
&quot; I like to call M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE A land in which the people would have shame to go on the streets , to ask for their bread , a nation where men would be ashamed to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or gl@@ utt@@ headed for dev@@ out purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are ch@@ ased out to get to fast riches . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ amor@@ ous : &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia probably just recently made .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 to Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published within the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has described Li@@ us Fall as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China will continue to release calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized a few reactions from abroad .
unified nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , arrived at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway Finn@@ mark Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government said that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China because exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she said in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told the Americans that he would have the opportunity to treat foreign countries in so far as they could help him with his recovery .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the US Embassy &apos;s request with@@ drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to expose Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o

&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert , on 3 July , Berlin , hopes that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had major concerns , whether the f@@ uss around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada in Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the hospital room and that it is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and release the per@@ missions for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France : France
&quot; China &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in an explanation on June 29 , to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France would eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan - Taiwan
&quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in a statement on June 28 around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , we say that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old corp@@ se appears from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twisted logic , since they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ rep@@ lies . &quot;
he asked questions of a rational kind with no answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ddle would take the effort to clarify this point , as long as he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing An@@ on on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the whole tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the title .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ important , even if we enjoyed free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ddle , who is the leader of a growing generation , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country does the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally rural and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay back our Prime Minister invoices ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , is always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies such as &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should talk more about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices , Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan again and again . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clari@@ fication then mostly the standard answer follows : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans often cook with anger if they are held for Americans , but I do not bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible at their back@@ pack , when they travel . &quot;
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before 11 September . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think that Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice &apos; .
&quot; first : being &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be sp@@ ie@@ ely - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background un@@ noticed , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence over the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm hearted , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just nice . our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop @-@ band published in Thailand has released a music video showing the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continue to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend does .
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video is indirectly referring to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it deals with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ sever@@ ed in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gives absolute decision to the Supreme Commander of the Army on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; Change Change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unity was established in the army , which monitors online content and accused persons who were accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand relies on strict protests against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax reli@@ efs . &quot;
&quot; the video even shows how people are thrown into a black van , before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment if they insul@@ t the monarchy .
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East Asia , above all in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people . today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district had a population of 16@@ ,000 after barely having risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the chron@@ icles of the chron@@ icles , symbol@@ ise the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ yed and they are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a local elder man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all of the community served . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ our @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ icles , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother prohibited us from taking pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the ruined building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get through the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit ourselves . &quot;
but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ hum@@ i ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , however , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right . &quot;
&quot; every day , I remember the city and the war once . &quot;
&quot; when our conversation is coming to an end , a little boy runs over to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball who then rolls down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood that wor@@ ships in their lives .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold coloured earrings in a ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,@@ 50 bu@@ cks the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - even hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
she does not want to reject anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; mother Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mother Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
it declares that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single parent , offered him the roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
in the corri@@ dors the travellers get in touch with their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she scre@@ ams in her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter &apos;s daughter with African hair spotted that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sad while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone away . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , mobile phone users received a phone notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an area of U@@ rum@@ qi in the city of U@@ rum@@ qi to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities also let the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the police , the app was to determine and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this App with the filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme care and surveillance measures , as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlets based on Twitter based on Twitter &quot; images from mainland China , &quot; the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police random@@ ly checked the inhabitants if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( In@@ cre@@ asing the Vend@@ ée Store ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system , thereby receiving un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all governmental branches , authorities and organisations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office during the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , remote drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is &apos;s personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries for death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; S@@ leep or Death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and establish that you are alone in a place where everything that is important has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all honor .
one that sm@@ ashed into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries for death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth continues on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security servant said it , with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; cries . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not have any high demands on a city that has been st@@ owed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply was stopped in the quarter . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence , scre@@ aming several times , &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined to a beautiful image that filled my expectations full and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; Get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ am it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear how you write &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near .
his hat@@ eful eyes turned to me .
and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was due to my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I said : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me and yet I don &apos;t regret a word from what I said .
&quot; he is in solitary confin@@ ement and his father alike . &quot;
&quot; his father is the same with him . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence lies to me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ ede all details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they have probably given me a larger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately place myself without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : hitting the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell gen@@ tile was a &quot; &quot; pre@@ acher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a rep@@ uted middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no striking faces of me , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
perhaps someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds ?
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I hear them scre@@ aming still &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that the Gre@@ ys introduced to us : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; &quot; th@@ under &quot; , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they have played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view . &quot;
this is not a house here ; it is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the c@@ lans of their clan into a hero .
&quot; I supervised the listening room and meet up on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me that way . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions which der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this di@@ ver and protest on demonstrations , which will soon find an end anyway . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have become accustomed to not responding .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a kind conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to punishment , even though I had nothing done to earn that punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this loving &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the toilet .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not yet enough to him , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had been working as a collector or if that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why it was next to an electrically charged bar . &quot;
&quot; electricity passed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move away , you will be mis@@ placed . &quot;
that was new .
&quot; otherwise , they had always released me . &quot;
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he shifts to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can rely on , is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ lows ( for example : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking and can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ inclin@@ ation against American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian prisoner of the second generation . &quot; he also calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own life circumstances , &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs Nes@@ café in two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gap of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sw@@ ath of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a free sky prison , especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
it is therefore easy to avoid doing basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan - not to land in prison .
&quot; recently the Ministry of Interior Jord@@ ani@@ ens cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts@@ hip , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert evening . &quot;
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which is asking the well @-@ established legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to choose for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement might well not be just rhet@@ oric , but rather reflect an ever @-@ evident , cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b recovered traditional sexual violence by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown , unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust .
&quot; in recent years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ our mor@@ de &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still difficult to see that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence may be &quot; in@@ definite times in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family , are necessary for women to do nothing . &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics which in his country long ago g@@ aged .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been submitted to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b , &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are in the core politically , can be continued . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats itself : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and every one is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were cens@@ ored up until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were swept out of the context , distorted , and his opinion was cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but only a mach@@ ined version was stre@@ amed , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ eh , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not be able to do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service noted several former government officials and members of the Association of Te@@ ach@@ ers , with the reason that they have critic@@ ised the problems in social media about the problems associated with deeply rooted corruption in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos; concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now resist@@ ed M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one susp@@ ects that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid cars , drums and dancing were handed over more than a thousand years ago , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ ishi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
for a long time I look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two solid cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a car that was 18 meters high was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade arms against sciss@@ ors and razor blade

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are common . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , experiences an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts stand up against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ ser art instead of bad advice which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year , which began in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution of &quot; love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel extin@@ ct , accommodating affection ? &quot;
this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation . she inspired young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Defense Colombia ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to military rhet@@ oric and carried their arms round the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now absorb them into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join together and would have to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation was born at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
he also plans to share his love with people who needed most of the most urgent attention this year .
&quot; thus the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the university Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation , moved to the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done before , in order to accept the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub@@ s@@ ulation of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ buch &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was also sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I only learned how to handle weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the beginning , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders gathered for a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects all of the Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more equ@@ itable . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who have never heard their hearing before and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their living circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , is painful to me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people , too , who have caused harm and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian people were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , to lift themselves up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now setting peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs above the LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not only about night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published , which themati@@ zed the spread , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the sex equ@@ ation of their country@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she moved to the USA in the end . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ andal ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost awareness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything together and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary wings . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which sick wings were you laid , in which the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it , but the doctor understood and took me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some said that I must prove it by running through the streets , others wanted me to appear on official television in Gros@@ ny , saying that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for her .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street once .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around his neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 on it . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to sell their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without registering me , without identification without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you do not believe you are safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know already , in which hotel you are plu@@ gging . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still carry in myself .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; if we chat with camera , I really try to look at how the person looks at it from her past - so to my male shape . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; with that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are even now gay men trapped in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not very many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to make themselves Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are recorded there so that they can be presented later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they had attacked some village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to become radic@@ alised . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself , when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports about that yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known to be very big when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; in the end , Russia wanted to bring us back to the &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but eventually returned to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never hurt me only one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t sp@@ it over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
one often says it to children when they make fun of sick people .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace lasted ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how the people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; whoever sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed previously , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic was constantly worsen@@ ing . &quot;
OC Media : what activities are you going on now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I esc@@ ort them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t spend a cent on it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up a sort of refuge .
I am a Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ er@@ ting .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know with foam before the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have also what ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear this . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be precise , different attitudes of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
&quot; and I &apos;m not sad at all , I just know I &apos;m myself . &quot;
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the picture of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August saw the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is dominated by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments when he had lit himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything . &quot;
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority and activists on site warn that more men could take life .
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month took some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe job due to the persecution of the Iranian government .
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power , and in 1925 it under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable areas of use for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is systematically den@@ ying the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Ara@@ bern jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only managed to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth grew to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has recently become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic per@@ ms emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their native ancest@@ or . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired , since even Arab names at work will not be tolerated , let alone speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why not identify myself with femin@@ ism , nor with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women react - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be feminine . &quot;
&quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer dou@@ bly and thre@@ ef@@ old . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I speak on skin color , on racism , on black women women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; up@@ lift their voices and sing &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t associate myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in their thinking , which relate to both the gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner spoke in his speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ised and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to be the significance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and entirely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana possibly : rec@@ la@@ iming ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor is rejected . &quot;

&quot; in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the main focus of her work lies on neglected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult struggle against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ing@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but you can &apos;t do more . &quot;
&quot; when a further wife of Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out for ill treatment , the well @-@ informed indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not benefit . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women actually refund ad at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit , be victims of violence , report to the law enforcement authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; In@@ tr@@ 1 blows and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation strikes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mal@@ treated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Prosecutor &apos;s office opened 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the real magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this happen . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who is ref@@ using for physical abuse , two women who do not do this come , &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an issue of its own , the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violent acts by men . &quot;

un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then after that , she was supposed to regret it forever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic power - one of the most frequent forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I would never have thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it happens only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they let themselves be deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ oric whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked this so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain blame .
Victoria San@@ tos who did not come from Paraguay fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated .
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ as case , everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; after all , her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started beating them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s adver@@ ts to the authorities remained without a result , and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an in@@ comprehensible legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , inadequate implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for you ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and punish harder as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus the law text was altered in a number of points , in order to allow the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and to be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill of law had fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence must bear on their own , if they simply want to refund ad and receive a safe place to raise the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as a normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the offen@@ ding of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time , until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are dealt with .
&quot; the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack its victim again . &quot;
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper still exposed to attacks
&quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ ani@@ ans have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting of corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison where he has served a year of imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were arrested and tried before , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had set off his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
&quot; since then , along with his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been suffering the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sul@@ tan is characterized by the persist@@ ently efforts of the security forces , especially the domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public freedom , including press freedom , including press freedom , public freedom , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and j@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the courts of justice . &quot; this led to corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having placed judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in a case of inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS in front of the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper was prohibited in every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted for dis@@ ruption of the public order , the abuse of the Internet , and the &quot; under@@ mining of the state &apos;s prestige . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years in prison and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ ani@@ ac ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was arrested in the amount of 5000 om@@ ania Ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , the Appe@@ als Court pronounced free , however , Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to a year and Al Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after a six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he has served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; despite the Court &apos;s decision to revi@@ ve Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the government of the government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information gave an instruction to extend the closure of Az@@ am@@ n by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister once again turned against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ plen@@ ish the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press has been viol@@ ated in Oman recently .
&quot; further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ bian authorities are still un@@ willing to end the extensive violation of the freedom of the press have an end . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the authorities to : &quot;
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2. to create a secure environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their right human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including court ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association as well as the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious impacts in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment to research these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed its first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself researched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the media &apos;s mis@@ understand@@ ings about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I am currently setting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always stay receiver instead of being a maker . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how large in your opinion is the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it be focused on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in relation to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines only make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how open source seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental issues around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was set only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many species of salad he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding .
&quot; the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts will ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but now he needs more time since his work becomes increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der to which I have to bl@@ ur .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new kind of salad because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and tries to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red roman sal@@ at in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station where it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement from the IT @-@ area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
&quot; it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed @-@ bred seeds . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately add it - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ters . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants may be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified , or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , the recent examples include the merger of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , whose recent examples include the merger of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer . &quot;
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ob@@ lige others to remain freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , as the gene pool available due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , shr@@ inks . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not yet exist , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so cultivated that they exhibit specifically desired characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and sustain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of pat@@ rons on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is taken away for breeders by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions by climate change are much less predictable . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property is owned by other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly won &apos;t promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves , and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. State of Oreg@@ on and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also cultivate its own values . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are required for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides that breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they manage to survive most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bree@@ der would be innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new , more powerful than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; although the USA seems to be a leader in the open source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , works together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to arrive at &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so the Os@@ si obligation is not simply one to be taken over in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , one explanation is not a law yet ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference entitled &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Open Source seed systems , declares that the Organization is currently building a world @-@ wide alliance of open source seed systems for which the official starting signal should be launched next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report for farmers , such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes to see more people soon to recognize . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has , above all , paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a part , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities block content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network issued a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true , despite this attack and the condem@@ nation of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend the laws of freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages , for example , the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language version of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &apos;s Qatar network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of site barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Colum@@ ns and articles which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider at which Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is still accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video about the police exercise physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed about the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the ban on blogs and any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , albeit only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
&quot; now , however , after having locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , virtual private networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) documented the blocking of suppliers , through the transfer of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) . &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began . &quot;
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could access .
&quot; the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis to act against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; newspapers all over Brazil day after day , with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rough pharmac@@ ies with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ water lake to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the power surge in Rio in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; published on August 16 , published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas in Rio de Janeiro , which are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover cru@@ el@@ ty of the police that only shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira arguments against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - how extra has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to the statistics of 2015 . these are the latest available data . &quot;
none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is on place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stressed , has been repeating the State &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit issued by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police order . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , however , this led to a decline of violent deaths . for some years , however , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports on the har@@ ass@@ ment and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this , entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape is , and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
war back or forth ; the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
&quot; a week later , it is now that the police force the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines as well : a fruit dealer died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to the victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and around Syria , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 challenged hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have stood under siege by rebel areas outside Damascus , which led residents to rely on locally produced food items or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the many years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional food @-@ grown foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the bel@@ ag@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it has become more and more known . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la on Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to obtain new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege can be seen . &quot;
we want our experiences to inspire people in conflict areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 &apos;s fires
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal , demanding justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state str@@ auer out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
in June a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area . &quot;
so that you can get a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; whole Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;

the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al by the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in Lei@@ ria &apos;s forest , a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , because the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned in places with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the form of forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a lock@@ out of the law , which allowed construction activity if the applicant could use funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light @-@ combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further and further , as in a vi@@ cious circle . &quot;
&quot; these problems are added to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when the inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information , using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was not maintained at this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the servers counted more than half a million hits . &quot;

&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - perhaps no more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , who were heavier than himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked on . &quot;
&quot; there was no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon before the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church distributed twice a day food to needy people . &quot;
&quot; it is true that because of relatively high levels of reference , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions that apply to asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the large majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; , &quot; which are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ trained personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they officially filed an application for asylum - which may have been delayed for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation have either to rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
that &apos;s how it took A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af set up his entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ bel &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afghanistan &apos;s operated companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have emerged . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the dining menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp Restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims far beyond the Italian gastronomy industry and retailers and aims to return to the country that forced him to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ bi@@ ds plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and cann@@ ing techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af made this trip yourself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way . &quot;
&quot; nine @-@ year report : draft laws of Egypt allow shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ y &apos;s Ne@@ ar report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that stipul@@ ates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks within six months of the deadline , users must register their full name as well as their ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step might be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the har@@ sh@@ er punishment for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such acts would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly have already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 , when he took photos of violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup d &quot; é@@ tat of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan , like more than 700 protest@@ ors who had been arrested for the same incident , waited four years in prison for a court case . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison line , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the burden of false charges including weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists interro@@ gated to complete documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , accused of business@@ men and ex @-@ ré@@ gi@@ me by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website on April 21st on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legal situation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the attri@@ bution of his sources , stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press agency , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as &quot; organis@@ er of dissemin@@ ating information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently owned by websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court dispos@@ es of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language items , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave the site been closed because it became &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to insti@@ gate a political campaign campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , in addition to China , one of the few countries in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop picking up
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance authorities , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time , and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . responses and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
