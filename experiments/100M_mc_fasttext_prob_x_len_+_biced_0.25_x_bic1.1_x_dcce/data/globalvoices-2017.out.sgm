<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American writers and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalists because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the suicidal plot of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be the one you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his opinion, he never keeps behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number, which received a candidate nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not associate Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"such as my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which takes people from all over the world, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, Trump Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trump intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Tastey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt vis-à-vis non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look differently from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(OB. D.: as much as" The white against all other ethnicities "; the word game of white in allusion to the white and whiplash, as it called the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have always, America is welcome to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyans, whose history, as he says himself, would be nowhere else in the world possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice of Donald Trumps there is, however, a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "roared the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices became louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trump Land, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="67">"the" Recycled Instruments Orchestra "by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the fact that the music played at both locations not only changed the life of the children, but also has a very close relationship with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the village: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 pupils became a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its use of drugs and gangs of violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come out of the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and playing in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga to play."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village that lies practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprepared instruments made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chávez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments mimic violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music by the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez remembers a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rubbish. the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as Favio something, which he had never seen before: a trash made of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today there is a whole orchestra, which plays on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">"a documentary called" "Land-fill Harmonic" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:"</seg>
<seg id="91">"every year, the world generates about one billion tonnes of waste."</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa visited."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to fire one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "all of a sudden, the prime minister is surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "says Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NGO stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery Stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who then expelled the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries who are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and join each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard for existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-empo, with the information circulated between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news of suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also attends the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea, by means of satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships fishing in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious voyages can be discovered - such that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the go to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a catch license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there are significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm which advocates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated $20 million in lost sales, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"such practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, flavoring names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system "," says Long. "" in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say "You can't run my port." "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to Me'." "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found refugees.</seg>
<seg id="128">"based on his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross through," "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that connects different levels of information. it is said to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by the position of each individual traceable vessel."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what's doing, "he says." here's a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to fish previously without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences now know that they are being observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, their use was prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries are also noticing these successes." "the effect is so strong that we are now also copying other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are an object of study." "in West Africa, hundreds of millions of dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "Safety is the goal of building even more such initiatives and structures in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"just recently, FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia got its first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship running under false flag. and not only the ship was on the go without a license and were used towing nets which are now forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually functions throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lumps of silver."</seg>

<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I sewed in, and saw a couch where men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached to it the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was bound there.</seg>

<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="346">Editing the original photo by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend their driving license, in the last month, witnessed a particularly misplaced translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on one sign, the Japanese word" "older drivers", "the" older driver "means, falsely - but perhaps also with a malicious rear-thought & # 8212; as" terrible motorists. ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing of the original photo by Joshua Levine shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos, who drew attention to the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could there be such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the correct English translation was first removed. the name" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate name" "elder drivers" "(German:" "older drivers" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (of the translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "awfully" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are due to the police."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in Kyoto prefecture for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors made 1.803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors rose in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the particularly unnamed reporter brought comments to the light published on the Yahoo version of the article, showing what prejudices some Japanese seem to have against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo about translation errors has among other things received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"-" "Is this the (" "terrible motorists" ") about not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" "So wrong is the translation actually not at all, isn't it?"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills, to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of the translation, cost-reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that do not have foreign employees, nevertheless make translations available in the company. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are real."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic propositions, which arise through machine translation, show that this technique can be replaced by no human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling imprints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. however, by large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible."</seg>
<seg id="394">"other online transmitters also took over recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organised by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicolás Maduros."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that the Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>

<seg id="405">"previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNA. this is a technique through which the DNS servers enquiries about certain domains fail to respond correctly."</seg>
<seg id="406">"if a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds faulty or denies the request when calling such a website."</seg>
<seg id="407">"we confirm a DNA lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet"</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before she graduated from the university, she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride she spoke about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"she who has become of something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked with Criadita - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected witness statements, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to the Criadita is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who have their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves", "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family, who receives the girl with himself and justifies his exploitation by faith, justifies that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have been given no training and maybe even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is maltreated, his family will be experienced only many years later."</seg>

<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"it was Criadita in the household of the former military man Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira defeated Marín as long as she suffered lethal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported about the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">"organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela, who were deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society, were responsible for the death of the girl."</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to injure the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes before the court, the case of Carolina Marín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes before judgment."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to sign up for bankruptcy and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers had to work now and began selling sweets on the street or market, in order to make money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she was still learning to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, it cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went back home and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they still had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted on a draft bill to "regulate the use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it comes to Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is asked to use citizens to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with acceptance of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and personnel ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a finer."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraphs and classified in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that is run over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video alignment and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose the registration."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, deputy and promoter of the bill, reported to the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of it, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that as they forcibly control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take her seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a lawsuit."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be debated with Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviant narration is present on the screen," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq, the animal trainer Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the horrendous Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of the leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor)."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian Leopard is the only predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes towards zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza passionately likes to show another side of her country that is not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, the progress made for Northeast Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, has been making progress in the last six years to revive the lives of those affected by the" triple catastrophe "in March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a regional prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the Fukushima and Iwate neighbourhoods were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, just because of that, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from the local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the closing light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsshelfe (the bank of the river, kasetsu juutaku) moved to final substitutions."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelter shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, more and more than 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of Fukushima evacuees still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were home after the disaster in accommodation, were moved to final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, have again opened its doors to December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are still in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures of the agrarian land, the tsunami and the nuclear accident, have attracted large-scale battles in the three prefectures of agrarian land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farmland by Fukushima, are in the" nuclear lock zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered extensively, but also here Fukushima remains far removed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level, as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it feels more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to establish an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in the case of disaster prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture Fukushima was also a witness to the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent spare-houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuees still live older than 50 years old. it is known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects. these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the rest, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>

<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this using hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, mobile audio studios have been part of schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North-Quebec and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop starts with the young participants in talks like" "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group who gave them a stopgap in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as well a translation into English, which is translated here into German:"</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">"in order to show potential customers exactly what is on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (garland," "plastic models of the dishes" ") are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the city of Kappabashi district, there are a lot of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"near Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos published this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic geries decorated cell phone bands as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essences is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or Lachsrogen is used, a popular topping served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form in order to surprise, for example, colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, we also offer rice stables (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"for more bizarre plastic dishes, check out: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter on Twitter the hashtag #"</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" fight against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the missing and tested regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the traumas or the communities who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" learning with Drug Trafficking "), which is intended to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"a video titled" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "tells exactly these stories."</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret tombs every weekend after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two her nephews on one single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task we have placed, to go and look for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="767">He left the house on 13 October.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he was to be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me, because I am alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but she does not pay her out, because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where are we to get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we need not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader from Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensation journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I am coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from professionals."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealer) if he's big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroic deeds" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were "open-minded."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirred and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been plundered by their business, like a family with threats, until they destroyed the business in the end not only the business, but also tore their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain over it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because you do not know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these awful days, I asked myself if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist, Mario Gutiérrez Vega, published the article" The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violent Generation. ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, violence through organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the public security council and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político has launched Narcodata's data journalism project, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication, it has been misleading to capture tragedies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" "wrong description" "or" "false context" "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions to our desire for pictures of messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the lorry fell victim to the truck."</seg>
<seg id="828">"authorities have described a fireball, which covered dozens of houses including cinema near, full of people who watched the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "That is Nigeria". "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of shredded bodies lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was raised several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to actual tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses had reported drastic atrocities which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." no one remained behind to count corpses, "said a resident of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict thermic between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo reappeared as it wrongly presented evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misfortunes; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"even one step further brings personal comments, such as this example falsely, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash reservation, published by the United Nations, those who escaped could flee, rape and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="915">"the picture of the DR Congo, with this Twitterhashtag, appeared and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris."</seg>

<seg id="917">"USA, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="918">"the picture was weathered as proof of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam, 2014."</seg>

<seg id="928">"there are two strong themes or frames (frames), which pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion."</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the murders of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second questionnaire uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are umpteen people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of mis- and false information, that actual atrocities are untrue and reproaches the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal is equal to recognize the tragedy. at times, these images are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and spectators and taking them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent mediums work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture is suggesting something, which can actually be used by the context or completely improper type."</seg>

<seg id="1001">"my girlfriend looks at me and says," "These things do not concern you or?" "why, because I am not Muslims?" "I ask."</seg>

<seg id="1004">They unmuslized me.</seg>

<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"we identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"this drawer is so well constructed in our collective presentation that as soon as Muslims, who like me do not fit there, become Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="1010">Demusstitizing of the muscles</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone with that.</seg>

<seg id="1017">"Islam, the Koran, and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"but in the Western vision, the religion of Rumis was deleted, as well as the most popular translations of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>

<seg id="1025">"I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen these powerful, flawed narrations dominate our newsfeeds."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"this narrative overshadowed the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries in the last three decades, while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"this Narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi Arabia, Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin."</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and erroneous, that often Sikh-men and children become the target of antimuslimic attacks and harassment."</seg>
<seg id="1033">"because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of" others. ""</seg>

<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" "listening to it often is connected to understand" "purposes these events instead" "listen to" "to feel, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and their representation are leading to the fact that the audience is involved in it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the story teller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamara tells the fable of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyugati is asked:" how is that to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative tours."</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the US to re-establish sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civil front for the neuronal test of debt) and the ecclesiastical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-determination of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government authorities who are responsible for the debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and an executive committee without personal interests in the public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organization with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"" "measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens in danger of being rejected by the people."</seg>

<seg id="1182">"the Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year."</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">"more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"at this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that will be held in Berlin, an event of the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: collective Investigations)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the true costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to make sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information whatsoever about its present state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book, entitled Collective Memory, gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time to time extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in charge of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the" Military Police Bassel "had taken part in Adra as a" strictly secret "command from his prison cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad government and noted them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and state remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and momentary director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bastide's cultural prototypes were more prescient than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around the year 2005, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this move to digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him. he has taught other prisoners, to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabuch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained."</seg>
<seg id="1222">"for one year, Bassel and Noura worked together in the book."</seg>
<seg id="1223">They smuggled the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1228">"it happens at every visit,"</seg>
<seg id="1229">"that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,"</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ourselves,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that any of the dangers does not matter to me,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter into every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">"which I carry with passion with me,"</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">"I quickly return to my loneliness,"</seg>
<seg id="1239">"to get all the moments back,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">Ghazi wrote on the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel:</seg>
<seg id="1243">"a year goes by, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1245">"I am in your cage,"</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">"today, we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time."</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mozambique: due to corruption, the director returned to previous post after release"</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, were sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money was from public funds from Mozambique airports, the Council of which took over Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to refer back to its old post, as the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people do not expect the promotion to be good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), has condemned the company's decision to re-establish the company:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"it represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a step back with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the accusers.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company seemed to be silent, causing no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" illegal ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half had eaten."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not say any morality:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that one recompensates someone who has already insulted the state in such a massive way.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing to return morale and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a matter of an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Mahel, to remind him that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Mahel prison not only to be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp and sharp one and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral portrayals, when he vigorously confirmed that" an ambitious person is capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions."</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is at the same time criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also rejected:"</seg>
<seg id="1282">"Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years away and released."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"and today the company, in which he lost money, sets it up again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яangelic fink (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12. may 2017"</seg>

<seg id="1286">"Facebook blocks the racist word" "Kalar" "in Myanmar and censored many users"</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word" "Kalar". ""</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of ostindian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "doldrums" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar may normally be associated with racism today, but the word in itself does not automatically evoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word, have been censored for their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as" "Kalar". ""</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical, before it denies any posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the campaign may send a strong signal to anyone who would like to spread the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banished:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... "when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to delete posts, posts and parts for 24 hours because the Post" didn't meet the Facebook community standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply attempt to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author informed his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work so."</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will bring only more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have thus banned words like" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a lot of sales, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of derision among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun on Facebook and consciously do not write the word" "Kalar" "in the context of hate speech, to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which have no hate speech but were removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post is" If you are a doctor, do you heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, Hasssprache in social networks should add to the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring out hate speeches on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word" "Kalar", "it would have been better to look at context as focused on code, and learned from them."</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago is an excuse for children</seg>
<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously decided on a law to ban the practice so that the age of heightened age is now 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), met a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, that the state should not interfere, as that, age does not determine the maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN-child rights convention, which defines the minors as, every person under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"the statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavored to abolish laws for children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. without doubt they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children, they were supposed to be damned for their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated matter, and eventually doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the Senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft bill against the children before was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after having previously been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws for children before had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's almost every price worth it."</seg>
<seg id="1361">"while Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it was definitely long enough to finish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:"</seg>

<seg id="1375">"but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"months ago Maharaj declared his intention to take judicial steps, the law was to be passed and it seems to redeem his promise."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"during the Attorney-General of Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to act contrary to the law, most social media users wished to go out of the debate on the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">"dear Sat, if we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply talk about the fact that we, the state in our bedroom, would simply talk about the fact that the state, our daughters, would be misused to prevent them from misuse," "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?"</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">"but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in different grades, although there are laws that they prohibit."</seg>

<seg id="1390">"through the mirroring of websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again"</seg>
<seg id="1391">"the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally shadowed."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day more clearly how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV shows defend themselves against the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, several mirrors pages (pages, which reflect the content of Wikipedia, are frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"in spite of the legal prohibition, the content is retrievable."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we did everything to remove snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also admitted that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansidebpedi.org, a MirrorPage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as employees of Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">You get access to a different URL which is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server manages the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he looked around, never satisfied."</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated man himself was able to wear a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international scene."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his home town right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">"he described on Facebook, how this first-class situation helps him in his work:"</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to break pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar strives to co-operate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition of Neptune nature, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, because he was already facing tigers face to face,"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book appeared."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"in order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at Bardia National Park shots of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz KalyProsecutor and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even of older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm, get this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state of Odisha by a false dish and violated by her family and the village community, after calling on a married relatives with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives, also not called by the name, is common among men. however, they have far fewer assignments to fear, if any, they should not come after this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health staff and housewives, joined a unique club and were thus quickly become the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the exploitation of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as children's marriage up to banishing HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who did not call her husband by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic because she wanted to open a conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not speaking aloud by the name of their husbands, is a custom that they have perpetuated and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini comments:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as a deceitful woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name of her, wanted to try out at home as she did."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" "Patriarchat" "before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they all asked," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of an age-old tradition, in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise it was only giggling; another decided to release the whole frustrated frustration against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law looked at her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini thought I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead indicating the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely ceased, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small it occurs."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most things this is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline curta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of strife and discussion about the advantages of your own dress code, the morality associated with the saris and much more, smuggled Rohini your own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion, Rohini confirms that things are slowly moving into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only made small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a couple of times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lies at the end of a river difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "messages from those they experience themselves" "and provide a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development needs."</seg>

<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years" imprisonment for "Subversion" following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China. "</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has described Lius Fall as an" "internal matter" "and tells a spokesman that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China will continue to release calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries criticized the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing, others are fully wiped out."</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government said that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations continued in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China because exports were largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, we say that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he unwittingly appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old corpse appears from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He asked questions of a rational kind with no answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmuddle would take the effort to clarify this point, as long as he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing Anon on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should start reading the whole transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the title.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country, he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unimportant, even if we enjoyed free and fair elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore is not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuddle, who is the leader of a growing generation, which makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmugam" "committed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country does the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally rural and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore, is always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many Singaporeans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear testimonies such as" "the defense of the country especially" "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk more about the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">"their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumours about certain parts of the world exposed and another facet is to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, Editor for Global Voices, Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I am most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I'll answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live in Japan again and again. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place, it is deemed to be polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"on my clarification then mostly the standard answer follows:" "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." "many Canadians often cook with anger if they are held for Americans, but I do not bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">"this is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible at their backpack, when they travel."</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before 11 September."</seg>

<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>

<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp 'nice'.</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being" "nice" "means to be spieely - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has one own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay in the background unnoticed, away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go so far, to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps simply cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence over the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm hearted, open friendliness, which I now connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a popular pop-band published in Thailand has released a music video showing the junta, which in 2014 took power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continue to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly politically, the music video is indirectly referring to the continued military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, the Charlie Chaplin video" Der dictator "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it deals with the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persevered in the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which gives absolute decision to the Supreme Commander of the Army on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the infamous program for" Change Change "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals viewed by the Junta as critics."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose a new unity was established in the army, which monitors online content and accused persons who were accused of having slandered the monarchy, prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand relies on strict protests against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, the martial law was declared in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax reliefs."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the video even shows how people are thrown into a black van, before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly have caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment if they insult the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the State of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold coloured earrings in a teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 bucks the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - even hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez tells, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm away from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a Joghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "mother Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mother Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez told that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single parent, offered him the roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors the travellers get in touch with their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she screams in her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter's daughter with African hair spotted that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she presents her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, mobile phone users received a phone notification in the Tianshan area of Urumqi in the city of Urumqi to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app is intended to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities also let the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the announcement of the police, the app was to determine and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with the filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme care and surveillance measures, as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlets based on Twitter based on Twitter" images from mainland China, "the censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police randomly checked the inhabitants if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (Increasing the Vendée Store) also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system, thereby receiving unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all governmental branches, authorities and organisations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office during the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, remote drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates Urumquis's personality rights of three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2002">He proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protest like weeds from the beautiful garden of our revolution.</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time, it was silent, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not have any high demands on a city that has been stowed to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had calmed down somewhat after the power supply was stopped in the quarter."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke through the silence, screaming several times," Allahu Akbar "from my house roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"a few minutes later, some of my friends felt brave enough to find together."</seg>

<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you realize that you release the mind from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father," "Get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scream it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there as I am now.</seg>

<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes turned to me.</seg>

<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>

<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was due to my foolishness, vanity, perhaps at the revolution."</seg>

<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>

<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed sentence lies to me up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a spiritual torture, which I was exposed to for months."</seg>

<seg id="2036">"otherwise, they have probably given me a larger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one more prisoner, and I must immediately place myself without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the officials left the cell and I resorted to an old-tried communication method: hitting the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell gentile was a" "preacher". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">"after a long hesitation, he finally answered me."</seg>

<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, there are no striking faces of me, and doctors are not there; we are all only numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Perhaps someone whose voice sounds similar to my sounds?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells.</seg>

<seg id="2055">"this was the secret of the secret: to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the traitor and terrorists in us, they have played their confessional blackmail card and betrayed the close view of their world view."</seg>

<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have become accustomed to not responding.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a kind conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to punishment, even though I had nothing done to earn that punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">To punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this loving "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the toilet.</seg>

<seg id="2094">"but what one can rely on, is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as fellows (for example: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"at the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking and can sympathise with the people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special disinclination against American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as a "Palestinian prisoner of the second generation." he also calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own life circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he pours Nescafé in two cups in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the gap of lukewarm coffee and the swath of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a free sky prison, especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to avoid doing basic things - as in the public during Ramadan - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Ministry of Interior Jordaniens cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontship, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert evening."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which is asking the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continued to choose for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement might well not be just rhetoric, but rather reflect an ever-evident, crystallizing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib recovered traditional sexual violence by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown, unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of 'Honour morde' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still difficult to see that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence may be" indefinite times in prison, "and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family, are necessary for women to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics which in his country long ago gaged.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been submitted to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib, "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are in the core politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, one verse often repeats itself:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every one is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were censored up until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later note that his comments were swept out of the context, distorted, and his opinion was censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a machined version was streamed," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not entail Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nueh, who later should work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not be able to do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service noted several former government officials and members of the Association of Teachers, with the reason that they have criticised the problems in social media about the problems associated with deeply rooted corruption in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs' concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now resisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" experiencing it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial democracies. at least he hopes this."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one suspects that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the solid cars, drums and dancing were handed over more than a thousand years ago, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are common."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences an increasing demand for esthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance, and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts stand up against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdresser art instead of bad advice which enables them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year, which began in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution of "love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel extinct, accommodating affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation. she inspired young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to this: after years of negotiations the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Defense Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to military rhetoric and carried their arms round the clock, must now re-integrate into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now absorb them into their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and would have to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation was born at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">He also plans to share his love with people who needed most of the most urgent attention this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build up a new life." the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the university Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation, moved to the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done before, in order to accept the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of subsulation of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," "said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuch" "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"he said," "Hello, what do they do?" "he said," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat down beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was also sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to handle weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the beginning, students and some of the FARC leaders gathered for a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects all of the Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more equitable."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who have never heard their hearing before and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I've seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their living circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, is painful to me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people, too, who have caused harm and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian people were prophesied that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, to lift themselves up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now setting peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2243">"homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs above the LGBTQ community is not only about night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published, which thematized the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the sex equation of their countrywoman, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she moved to the USA in the end."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer for a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you still dishonour the family, you scandal? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I know only that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost awareness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything together and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right pulmonary wings."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which sick wings were you laid, in which the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it, but the doctor understood and took me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said that I must prove it by running through the streets, others wanted me to appear on official television in Grosny, saying that I didn't change my gender that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the street once.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the whole republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened window panes and a number plate with a 95 on it."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to sell their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without identification without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you do not believe you are safe, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people know already, in which hotel you are plugging. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it's the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still carry in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"if we chat with camera, I really try to look at how the person looks at it from her past - so to my male shape."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with that I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are even now gay men trapped in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to make themselves Kadyrow's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are recorded there so that they can be presented later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they had attacked some village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to become radicalised."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this just a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself, when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports about that yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known to be very big when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"in the end, Russia wanted to bring us back to the" civilisation, "but eventually returned to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia has never hurt me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't spit over the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says it to children when they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace lasted?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how the people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"whoever smiled and laughed previously, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic was constantly worsening."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going on now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, gatherings, I escort them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent on it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up a sort of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alerting.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know with foam before the mouth, that there are no gays."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Cabardines have which, the Russians have also what; on the whole planet there is it - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear this."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be precise, different attitudes of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"and I'm not sad at all, I just know I'm myself."</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The picture of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on 27 August saw the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is dominated by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments when he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority and activists on site warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month took some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe job due to the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power, and in 1925 it undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable areas of use for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime is systematically denying the Ahwazi Arabern jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only managed to worsen the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth grew to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has recently become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic perms emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their native ancestor."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and be hired, since even Arab names at work will not be tolerated, let alone speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why not identify myself with feminism, nor with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion, written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be feminine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on gender is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer doubly and threefold."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I speak on skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "uplift their voices and sing" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can't associate myself as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking, which relate to both the gender and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner spoke in his speech in 1851:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanised and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to be the significance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and entirely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana possibly: reclaiming (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither passed nor ignored nor is rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that has been especially reported about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be re-published here."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with a surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa sums up the urgency and importance of his work in one question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary film and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the main focus of her work lies on neglected subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with the help of suppressed communities to tell their stories in their way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay". "the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weightingraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but you can't do more."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when a further wife of Balbuena pointed out for ill treatment, the well-informed indication of Ada Báez did not benefit."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women actually refund ad at all, they generally do not receive any support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit, be victims of violence, report to the law enforcement authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Intr1 blows and statistics 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation strikes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really maltreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Prosecutor's office opened 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of women's ads came."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the real magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman who is reimbursed in Paraguay for psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this happen."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who is refusing for physical abuse, two women who do not do this come," "she explained at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an issue of its own, the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to her estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violent acts by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Unseen abuse and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do it, but then after that, she was supposed to regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic power - one of the most frequent forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it happens only women who are too subservient, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetoric whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had liked this so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos who did not come from Paraguay fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias case, everything started with mental mistreatment."</seg>
<seg id="2521">"after all, her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's adverts to the authorities remained without a result, and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an incomprehensible legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay's laws: good approach, inadequate implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# for you)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious impacts in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment to research these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research carried out by African scientists helps to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed its first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the media's misunderstandings about this research."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently setting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always stay receiver instead of being a maker."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>

<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how large in your opinion is the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it be focused on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="2622">"there are need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa in relation to Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system, that magazines only make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called" paywall "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how open source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental issues around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was set only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many species of salad he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts will ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but now he needs more time since his work becomes increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river there is a boulder to which I have to blur.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "he says." "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new kind of salad because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and tries to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red roman salat in the "greenhouse" of the station where it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement from the IT-area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed-bred seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately add it - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patters."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Ossi board member, Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants may be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified, or not, from organic agriculture or not." in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, the recent examples include the merger of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, whose recent examples include the merger of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative oblige others to remain freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, as the gene pool available due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, shrinks."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not yet exist, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so cultivated that they exhibit specifically desired characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and sustain threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patrons on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is taken away for breeders by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions by climate change are much less predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it contradicts, however, that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly won't promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patented plant features:" we do not really create the features ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves, and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. State of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" if you breed a variety, you also cultivate its own values. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required for their cultivation of mass herbicides that breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they manage to survive most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salate in his farmed garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the opinion that breeder would be innovative by avoiding plant patrons:" it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new, more powerful than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years", "he says." with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seems to be a leader in the open source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, works together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to arrive at "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation is not simply one to be taken over in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, one explanation is not a law yet; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference entitled" "Open Source" "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Open Source seed systems, declares that the Organization is currently building a world-wide alliance of open source seed systems for which the official starting signal should be launched next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report for farmers, such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes to see more people soon to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has, above all, paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a part," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider at which Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is still accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video about the police exercise physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed about the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the ban on blogs and any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, albeit only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"now, however, after having locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"furthermore, virtual private networks (VPNs) documented the blocking of suppliers, through the transfer of Internet censorship and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)."</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian people have no legal basis to act against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a rubric in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas in Rio de Janeiro, which are controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to the victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and around Syria, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>

<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebels have stood under siege by rebel areas outside Damascus, which led residents to rely on locally produced food items or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the many years of blockage, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the conventional food-grown foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the belagged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>

<seg id="2818">"due to the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of fungal seeds from the regions before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Ghouta free of charge."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal, demanding justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state strauer out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks, spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon area."</seg>

<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the form of forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a lockout of the law, which allowed construction activity if the applicant could use funds for self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," "João Sorval continued in the same article of the newspaper Público."</seg>

<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked on."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there was no services and no heating there. we hung nylon before the open windows, so that we didn't freeze at night."</seg>

<seg id="2935">"the law, which was advertised by sixty members of Parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament, and shall be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another MP filed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the harsher punishment for the insult of the President or a senior official."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"under the law proposition, such acts would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly have already been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) on 13 August 2013, when he took photos of violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup d" état of elected President Mohammed Morsi. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan, like more than 700 protestors who had been arrested for the same incident, waited four years in prison for a court case."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison line, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on the burden of false charges including weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting to pro-Morsi sitting blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists interrogated to complete documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">"in May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who co-founded the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill of law, accused of businessmen and ex-régime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on the Nawaat website on April 21st on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legal situation look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia rejected the attribution of his sources, stating article 11 of the Tunisian press agency, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he entered the District Court in Tunis on 09th May as a witness in the case."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to new regulations of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia closed access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as" organiser of disseminating information. ""</seg>
