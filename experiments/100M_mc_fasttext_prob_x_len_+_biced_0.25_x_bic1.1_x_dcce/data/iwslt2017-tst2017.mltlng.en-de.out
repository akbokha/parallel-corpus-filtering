this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA listened illeg@@ ally to Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed down designs for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and urged him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s design , to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional addition , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous , which they disclose . &quot;
&quot; so when the government joined R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government of R@@ isen have been dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can always hide themselves less .
&quot; rather than failing to make statements and aw@@ aken R@@ isen , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly taken care of his telep@@ hon@@ y , &quot;
&quot; just like its email data , financial and bank information , its credit balance , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ cker going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet existed when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers that was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , which was developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective message agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring out mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to talk about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer , the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street In@@ sider , who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news to 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
the Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has post@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trail of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting for the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
&quot; now that sounds like the plot of an agent , or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ ROM . &quot;
&quot; it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this be what is going on ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used to hide and veil their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is to happen . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the United States .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans , who came in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but through the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information to specify less information to start a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed staff of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
&quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice . &quot;
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to do this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and the powerful .
but as a native optim@@ ist I really see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen advances into more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU is captured in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after I had finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards , he would go to the cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard to say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , sne@@ aking at tens of toes to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed , my room@@ mate draws out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear in fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how to earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha !
we created a website and so called &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and dropped the door into the castle , Brian and I started . &quot;
had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into the roll .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented to investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a website that people post on public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one , who is still with comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people &apos;s homes . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can be sure of the things that you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we are striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone from your left @-@ hand seat .
this silent start of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read their SMS , they view your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had only imagined with his name , if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really stick out very well un@@ locked mobile phones !
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated , how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
little by surprise we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add the reputation of a person -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from similarities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get out of yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; when you talk too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one can tell too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- the request is not accepted either . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I &apos;m going with my family vacation . &quot;
how can it be created with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people are entitled to our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated flats .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line if trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem . &quot;
for people have the right to trust each other .
&quot; when trust works , it can create wonders . &quot;
&quot; one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay , where he suffered a heart attack . &quot;
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ un blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgement :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , although they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay is starting .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; but now simply call the &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people put a part of themselves open , and that will change everything . &quot;
&quot; when one travels nowadays , it is comparable to fast food . it is efficient and reliable but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what , if travelling , would be a rich buffet from local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place that was visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of the neighborhood , of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought from joint participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea , Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
were offered now residents . students who were looking for a place to stay .
&quot; were given to people whose children were pulled out . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , night 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
there was hospitality even before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amazing , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media represent people who look like me . &quot;
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that Americans are mine , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way . &quot;
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I was 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only pas@@ sively adopted the faith of my parents .
I have stri@@ ven with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , I lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked to the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should you do such a thing ?
&quot; I changed the channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in N@@ u , the acts of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I was sil@@ ently driving -- as deep as we drove -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , which said , &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; Sei@@ d carefully , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again , warning : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims and wounded them . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have swept the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love issues . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only poses the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is kept only under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is in@@ correctly posed .
&quot; as all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the U.S. body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ men and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; maybe there will be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people in other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alisation , it has been established that it begins online . as first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts are able to make a bra@@ in@@ washing , the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ or their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still argue that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality they read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that her anger would make sense , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it work on ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an authorit@@ arian system of governance , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit messages to test persons , in which they were reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they agree more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ dens us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was tal@@ k@@ ative at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for the half of the members were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I came together . &quot;
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or be connected to those who think : we are better than that .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depth , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am not an exception in any way .
&quot; when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is just in front of becoming a billi@@ ard business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air pack@@ ag@@ a has entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ deduc@@ tible structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , one of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; stern &quot; &quot; starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other free@@ zers it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most starter motors , it can float and has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a h@@ edge @-@ rigid restriction is that it is sensitive to turbul@@ ences such as wind bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter in which position the aircraft can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , skilled pilots were able to fly away remote controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it only has a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or check@@ ers , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens a lot so that it can fly stable , and can move in the room everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , is an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the most au@@ sp@@ icious capacity , &quot;
&quot; moving in the room in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at this .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , even if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making half an air@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine here on the Broadway would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy . they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment they ligh@@ tened bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy free in the form of light --
we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
&quot; some 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ shaft observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be considerably increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore we call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ cked through the earth through the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector through .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like lig@@ o measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other . &quot;
lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a truly al@@ ber@@ n@@ ous dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and st@@ acking . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ out during the rising of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometre long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite convenient , because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
in the case of sounds it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
for example the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to the story behind certain features such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume . &quot;
&quot; now just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make any simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the All literally speak . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation too l@@ ur@@ king , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , chir@@ ping simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; when the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same circus with an additional key change . this sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement of motion , engraved in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that must never be forgotten -- &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s noise &#93; , someone who knows what he needs to hear , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes , each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , that rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
this is the where@@ ab@@ outs of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to study the universe , as never before . &quot;
&quot; on this way , we can listen to everything and hear the un@@ seen . &quot;
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or fundamentally -- .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ aque are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and probably the most important thing : I am optimistic that in the universe we have never seen , which we have never seen nor of which we have no idea of . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ ri@@ ers for our archaeological work , so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in the universe , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang myself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to begin with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected item . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; bi@@ bs &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; bi@@ bs , I need milk for my beak @-@ t@@ asse . &quot;
she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , catch you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
&quot; I do TV , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , every nine days four shows , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions in 67 languages run for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are shows that I have created myself and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who still makes this ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you , that all of you who work so hard will take a business or a household , take me seriously if I talk about work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just walk around the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dreaming in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened into my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , as I put troops on , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , they carry a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . &quot;
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
&quot; a sum begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could forever drive on it . &quot;
many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what she does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began to work and work and to build , build , create , and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the sum is music . the sum is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you cannot asp@@ ire otherwise than by size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being different than asp@@ iring to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ mons .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is a genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear statement : the more the more successful I become , the more episodes the more overl@@ apping , the more things there are , the more things the more , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sum , the sum , the sum . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sum stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work institution .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny .
&quot; Emer@@ son says , &quot; T@@ estim@@ ony , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ane .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the tot@@ als ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum did not come back .
my sum was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ mons .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly you fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you work , you work , you love what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mo@@ m , a mo@@ m , a mother , a painter , a mother , a painter , a mother , you just love someone else and that gives you a bit like the sum , when the hum@@ ming stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then my &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I already want to say no when two things become aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they didn &apos;t call me &quot; bi@@ bs . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am titanium and my sums bet@@ ak , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ eliness and lack of sum@@ mons , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and damp kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes for letting go , or whatever the girl leaves in &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ mons , but a sum@@ mons . &quot;
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the sum of titles , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of shows and television hours and how oper@@ able my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depend on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing is not up to me , as they work . &quot;
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , for what a man prefers to be than to be house ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , none of it is . &quot;
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dancing parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and talking my teen @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no more need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes on the track !
&quot; no mobile phone , laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner prepared for children .
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be children . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail , and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track . why not treat yourself 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return when I do not work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum@@ mons now .
the sum of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; I have never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I run , the tro@@ op , which I run , the troops , the screens , the sums , the sum , the sum , the other , the real sum : the sum of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , loving , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard one of the most known , &quot; &quot; depth brain stimulation . &quot; &quot; they im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate an electrode deep in the brain to influence the ne@@ ural circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time I was a senior doctor , working day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
often I cared for patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you must imagine that in the case of cran@@ ial brain trau@@ mas , the brain is s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure rises . &quot;
&quot; to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes a portion of s@@ wollen brain mass has to be removed . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the mass of the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece , it is comparable to small children that are taken out of their families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to make it thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so . &quot;
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can transform into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fo@@ etus they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean @-@ François
and then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we ple@@ aded it to the unloading point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we ple@@ ad these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we ple@@ ad the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we ple@@ aded the cells to a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared after a few weeks as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we inflic@@ ted a violation of the same cells and the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been pl@@ anti@@ ated .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we colored in vitro , in culture . &quot;
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from one tablet .
they did that very well .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
on the left @-@ hand side you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide approximately 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; see now , when we pl@@ anti@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ anti@@ le them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the main obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : it &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the clinical study &apos;s approval . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
you first really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable content .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the democratic process of our country was unmistak@@ ably clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Chinese Communist Party and even the Euro@@ group of a false belief , could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are wa@@ sting , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; Twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy spar@@ ners and corporations , but it is too anxious to invest in it where it would be productive and bring income to which humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in all wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail@@ roads , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did except to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and hu@@ g the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; as a result , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 years unemployed in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that could be perceived by the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up . &quot;
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances that cause ede@@ ma to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be employed to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the arms control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concluded too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it applied the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they admitted to them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting in questions of the coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted for a long time --
&quot; like a candle that shines very bright , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only arose as a complete separation between politics and economy , and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , by gradually under@@ mining the politics of politics and developing it . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not part of a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because they can be in the government today , and yet not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals of which they fed , that they end up star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; democratic &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and of mankind &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring the policy and the economy together again and it would be better if the &quot; demo &quot; keeps control , like in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms regain their position only through a miracle , as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , more waste , and social conflicts lower , just as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we will re@@ unite the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
so the question is not whether or not capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all revenues come from capital and from redemption , and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no more distinction between those who are owned by companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no longer an exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no lo@@ fty twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; -- and any government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re @-@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which they are privileged persons , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we awake in such a world
or are we going to sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... we do not do this , the technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t angle , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you keep from the view of the west on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it takes place -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
China now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself smells huge in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt us from compl@@ ac@@ ency , and perpet@@ ual denial that a massive exploitation line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still have chosen denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , it might be delayed for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what are your views ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , particularly in a ten@@ se situation , claims he has no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the clas@@ hes going through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have passed a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; no one from the Troika , which imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolute .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be equally well @-@ tolerated for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of Roy Price has never heard most yet , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows get this review .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , it will be a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows such as &quot; Break@@ ing Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ting where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle ul@@ ling , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he has to make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he considers a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes up many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows by evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon prints things for nothing , do you take action correctly ? &quot;
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show , when you start p@@ aus@@ ing , which parts you skip over or look over again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show to produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com on four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked to do . &quot;
&quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of staging a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data via the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they show the shows , their course of shows , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; you have two very competitive , data experienced companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by a very powerful computer .
&quot; what can be expected is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is a bit app@@ alling because we are living in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , is available . &quot;
not always generating the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of influenza , the aw@@ ful way , they can predict -- by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data is notic@@ e@@ ably moving into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should better ensure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use much data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the components ; as a branch , you put the components together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then to come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we own it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re @-@ assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete , even if the information is incomplete , especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they wouldn &apos;t have been able otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with that decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; that &apos;s what the data says . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to steer our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ Ques@@ tion you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will be using a demo version later .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have heard in hind@@ sight on the ball . &quot;
&quot; however , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball becomes smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
