<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA listened illegally to Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally handed down designs for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and urged him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the government's design, to condemn whistleblowers and spy journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional addition, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous, which they disclose."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government joined Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government of Risen have been dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than failing to make statements and awaken Risen, it could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly taken care of his telephony,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its email data, financial and bank information, its credit balance, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and risens supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistle-blocker going to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for whistle-blowers that was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, which was developed by us by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a chance to bring out misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to talk about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent from news to 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Moselle Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosbags Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has postbox firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trail of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting for the next release, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now that sounds like the plot of an agent, or a John-Grisham-ROM."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be what is going on?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used to hide and veil their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havases work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is to happen."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans, who came in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortune in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle of which these tax havases work, Mosbag Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information to specify less information to start a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed staff of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">"here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to do this, we have to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very trivial as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and the powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a native optimist I really see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen advances into more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is captured in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who get up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the transparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards, he would go to the corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard to say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Oh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I rock in? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, sneaking at tens of toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"as I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost ploughed, my roommate draws out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how to earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and so called "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and dropped the door into the castle, Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented to investors:" "we want to create a website that people post on public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still with comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's homes."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can be sure of the things that you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we are striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone from your left-hand seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent start of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read their SMS, they view your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had only imagined with his name, if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments that all say: "he can really stick out very well unlocked mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated, how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little by surprise we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add the reputation of a person -- in our case through judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get out of yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when you talk too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one can tell too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother -- -- the request is not accepted either. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "Tolle artwork in your apartment! I'm going with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can it be created with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are entitled to our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devastated flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line if trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have the right to trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, it can create wonders."</seg>
<seg id="211">"one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay, where he suffered a heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spun blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives, although they don't know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay is starting.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled over this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply call the" rental industry, "the thing will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of themselves open, and that will change everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when one travels nowadays, it is comparable to fast food. it is efficient and reliable but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what, if travelling, would be a rich buffet from local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place that was visited, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of the neighborhood, of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought from joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered now residents. students who were looking for a place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="241">"were given to people whose children were pulled out. incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, night 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was hospitality even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media represent people who look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show that Americans are mine, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born this way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I was 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively adopted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have striven with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>

<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, I lived in the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked to the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... "... in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..."... "..." "..." "..." "..." "..." "..." "..." "..." "..." "..." "..." "..."

<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in Nu, the acts of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I was silently driving -- as deep as we drove -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations, which said," Be watchful, "Seid carefully," "Stay in well illuminated areas," "Don't be sampled."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again, warning:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims and wounded them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have swept the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love issues."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only poses the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is kept only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is incorrectly posed.</seg>
<seg id="327">"as all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the U.S. body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-men and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe there will be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people in other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalisation, it has been established that it begins online. as first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists are able to make a brainwashing, the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhor their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still argue that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imagination, when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality they read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every priest, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that her anger would make sense, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity, and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if you submit messages to test persons, in which they were reported negatively about Muslims, they agree more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hardens us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective innocence, it is not just about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talkative at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when did my brother become such an accomplished young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="377">"fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for the half of the members were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at that moment, I came together."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or be connected to those who think: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is just in front of becoming a billiard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packaga has entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-deductible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, one of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called" "stern" "starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other freezers it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"unlike most starter motors, it can float and has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A hedge-rigid restriction is that it is sensitive to turbulences such as wind bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that no matter in which position the aircraft can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly away remote controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or checkers, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens a lot so that it can fly stable, and can move in the room everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the most auspicious capacity,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in the room in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, even if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half an airless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine here on the Broadway would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for guys like us, wages are in development and creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"at 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy. they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lightened brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"some 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand at -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, design and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational-shaft observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo could be considerably increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves rocked through the earth through the two colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and their observatories like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a truly albernous dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and stacking."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stout during the rising of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometre long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite convenient, because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">For example the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to the story behind certain features such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the All literally speak."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation too lurking, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, chirping simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"when the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement of motion, engraved in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that must never be forgotten -- [Surrender's noise], someone who knows what he needs to hear, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes, each with 30-fold solar mass, that rotate around as fast as the rods of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the whereabouts of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves a completely new way to study the universe, as never before."</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to everything and hear the unseen."</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or fundamentally --.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserole stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that in the universe we have never seen, which we have never seen nor of which we have no idea of. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo they observe, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauriers for our archaeological work, so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in the universe, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang myself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year, I would say" "yes!" "before I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to begin with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected item. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "bibs" "for inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"bibs, I need milk for my beak-tasse."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude to life in my family. from then on I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things out, catch you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do TV, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, every nine days four shows, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions in 67 languages run for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shows that I have created myself and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, that all of you who work so hard will take a business or a household, take me seriously if I talk about work, so you understand that I don't just walk around the computer and fancier, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not dreaming in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened into my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, as I put troops on, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, they carry a high tone, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sum begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could forever drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that's what she does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began to work and work and to build, build, create, and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sum is music. the sum is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you cannot aspire otherwise than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being different than aspiring to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the summons.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I know only that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear statement: the more the more successful I become, the more episodes the more overlapping, the more things there are, the more things the more, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the sum, the sum, the sum."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single work institution.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there but you can write my Nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says," Testimony, I want to go to Shonda country. ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titane.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the totals ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sum was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium doesn't sleep, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summons.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if what you do, the work that you love, suddenly you fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" howl, stupid author-Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you work, you work, you love what you do to be a teacher, a banker, a mom, a mom, a mother, a painter, a mother, a painter, a mother, you just love someone else and that gives you a bit like the sum, when the humming stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">"and then my" "southern states waitress" "asks me a question."</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no when two things become aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they didn't call me" bibs. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "" kittens "." "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am titanium and my sums betak, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of summons, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky finger and damp kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes for letting go, or whatever the girl leaves in" "The Ice Queen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sum comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the summons, but a summons."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the sum of titles, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of shows and television hours and how operable my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing is not up to me, as they work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, for what a man prefers to be than to be house?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"that I am too relaxed, none of it is."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dancing parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you think me naive, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a ladybird or biscuit replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teen-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no more need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can take 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner prepared for children.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be children."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail, and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track. why not treat yourself 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my summons now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I have never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum. the land I run, the troop, which I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sum, the sum, the other, the real sum: the sum of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, loving, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think things out, I'll raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard one of the most known," "depth brain stimulation." "they implantiate an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neural circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at the time I was a senior doctor, working day and night in the emergency room."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I cared for patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you must imagine that in the case of cranial brain traumas, the brain is swollen and the cranial pressure rises."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, it is necessary to reduce cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes a portion of swollen brain mass has to be removed."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the mass of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece, it is comparable to small children that are taken out of their families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the surroundings to make it thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François was able to do so."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells, which can transform into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the foetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain out of the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did to Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we pleaded it to the unloading point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we plead these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we plead the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we pleaded the cells to a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared after a few weeks as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we inflicted a violation of the same cells and the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been plantiated.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we colored in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor range in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide approximately 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"see now, when we plantiated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implantile them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the main obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: it's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the clinical study's approval."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You first really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable content.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- the democratic process of our country was unmistakably clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and even the Eurogroup of a false belief, could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are wasting, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "Twin summit paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy sparners and corporations, but it is too anxious to invest in it where it would be productive and bring income to which humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars were invested in all wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railroads, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did except to inflate stock exchanges and hug the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"as a result, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be offset by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 years unemployed in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that could be perceived by the pessimism of investors, which could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up."</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances that cause edema to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be employed to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the arms control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy concluded too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy because of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it applied the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they admitted to them the right to political co-determination with equal voting in questions of the coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only arose as a complete separation between politics and economy, and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, by gradually undermining the politics of politics and developing it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because they can be in the government today, and yet not in power, because the power of politics is migrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals of which they fed, that they end up starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" democratic "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and of mankind's well-being."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring the policy and the economy together again and it would be better if the" demo "keeps control, like in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms regain their position only through a miracle, as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, more waste, and social conflicts lower, just as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we will reunite the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyperautocracy that lets the film" Matrix "appear like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether or not capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" matrix, "in which machines serve human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one job to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all revenues come from capital and from redemption, and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no more distinction between those who are owned by companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there that the company does not belong to. no longer an exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no lofty twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "the cosmos", "in units of" "cosmos" "-- and any government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have, in particular, against the background of a re-unified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberating, in which they are privileged persons, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awake in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... we do not do this, the technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't angle, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you keep from the view of the west on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it takes place -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">China now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself smells huge in hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt us from complacency, and perpetual denial that a massive exploitation line passed through the eurozone, and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, still have chosen denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, it might be delayed for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what are your views ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, particularly in a tense situation, claims he has no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the clashes going through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have passed a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There's worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"no one from the Troika, which imposed this policy on us, confessed:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be still quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930, what it appears to me, it will be equally well-tolerated for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most of Roy Price has never heard most yet, although he probably is responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the review distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, it will be a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows such as" Breaking Bath, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicting where after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle ulling, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he considers a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes up many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows by evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon prints things for nothing, do you take action correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show, when you start pausing, which parts you skip over or look over again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show to produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom on four Republican US Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked to do."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of staging a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data via the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they show the shows, their course of shows, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"you have two very competitive, data experienced companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what can be expected is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is a bit appalling because we are living in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious choices, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data, is available."</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always generating the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the awful way, they can predict -- by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data is noticeably moving into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should better ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use much data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, disassemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the components; as a branch, you put the components together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we own it all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to re-assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete, even if the information is incomplete, especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they wouldn't have been able otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards "did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "that's what the data says."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to steer our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be using a demo version later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have heard in hindsight on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you naturally know when you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball becomes smarter and smarter and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
