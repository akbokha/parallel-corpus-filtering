Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution where young people are to meet today .
a chapel where now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former ground of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories on days .
it is nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavarian At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavarian Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the big picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called primitive positions , were incorporated for cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian survey management , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first sur@@ veying . &quot;
their client : Napoleon .
&quot; since the spring of 1800 , the French army guide occupied Bavaria with Austria during the Second Coalition War . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph pushed forward the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; the comparison of early / Today is most impressive , in the example of the state capital . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is the &quot; &quot; Unter@@ send@@ ling &quot; , &quot; which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming appears a smaller @-@ section card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers numbered from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ inary &quot; &quot; from which the land tax was derived . &quot;
small plots today no longer occupy farmers anymore - but gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which had been the venue of the October Festival in 18@@ 10 , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one is reading not only the street name &quot; &quot; am Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the skies &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , people once locked up with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was established there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden initiated the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the anchor of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 seats were extended . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
young people at the Sal@@ esi@@ ans in Munich meet in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
&quot; West lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , east of residential buildings of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural style based on the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were working and on 5 April 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizens &apos; Rights Committee published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , fast @-@ based incidents in the entire country occur and be noted here , &quot; said the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to obtain discrimination , as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that people are going to happen .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General At@@ tor@@ ney Office , in which black drivers in the state will be hal@@ ted 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people have to be ready , whether they bring to ch@@ ew money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report program of the FBI , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states agreed to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Femin@@ ine Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Assembly Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ wing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U city association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , as well as many k@@ itt@@ ens and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative @-@ loose marketing pathway for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively region@@ ales .
&quot; since he is also chairman of the BL@@ H@@ V president of Fis@@ her@@ y bach , he called the &quot; &quot; turn@@ key project &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep faces .
&quot; the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much needed to be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it did not lead a bio@@ economy . &quot;
for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leadership . &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
we hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they carry on their operations , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised because of funding
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
the disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares which must not be aff@@ or@@ ded by at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; from the total cost of € 71 500 , half over leader was promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and farm women .
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg offers state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art funding for pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area may not be slu@@ gg@@ ish ( inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 Fis@@ her@@ y Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the coverage area is 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; now , the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty &quot;
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value them just like any other - therefore the ad@@ mitt@@ edly staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have told him if he had done it .
&quot; but he resor@@ ted to its importance , and in particular the meaning you attributed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base has been added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly correct , but as he himself formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tired , your arms , / your oppressed masses , who long for breathing freely , and the mis@@ erable garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable rub@@ b@@ ish &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mps USA .
&quot; this conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America . &quot;
Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic illustration .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ am of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not invited , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ ation@@ ist who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the importance of the statue is entirely a matter of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing it as it was seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
&quot; and this , of course , is not the prospect of ever recognizing Miller and Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power , ign@@ ites . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black shows Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two ball@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the Director &apos;s Director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to find it , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected as team captain by the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was unbelievable , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought naturally were great .
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alli@@ ons competing in their fifth world champi@@ onships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year set five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about this team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was anyway a great honor , but to know that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , it makes something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Scot@@ sman who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there , and it just will be a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long before the newspapers struck him , from the domestic policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he pushed for criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led as sheep to slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a reci@@ pro@@ cal reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side is a public forum called official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the govern@@ ors &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or amm@@ uni@@ tion or hat@@ eful people , who swing the whi@@ p online . &quot;
the mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort rather than a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what designated the governor as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; attack would probably call others &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or to arrest and arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell in Virginia last week .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck their lead . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and Navigation with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in domestic comfort for the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an is hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which last year led to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament messenger in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ home player in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to action on home ground . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m happy about how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field is the former master champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , parking costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( UK@@ E ) come to a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; said investig@@ ator Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases per year due to passive smoking in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house @-@ inclu@@ sions the situation is more complicated than suspected , because in the underground there is a lot of hiding places , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which is repeatedly hin@@ dered by the construction , represents a major problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barri@@ cades is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are allowed to pass through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ arot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually lays a sweet potato - locally called &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the bon@@ ded tu@@ ber is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raising advance in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which was stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ arot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated board , which were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves to our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esian gold country .
&quot; the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has estimated $ 78 billion worth of wood resources . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military retains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Commission of Human Rights .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Are Every@@ where &quot; &quot; is called in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as non @-@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim immigrants come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting @-@ caf@@ et@@ erias sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are struggling to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native Papua - the m@@ um @-@ m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his campaign in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a bon@@ fire in En@@ arot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an attack on their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was struck so severely that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental commission was ign@@ ited and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center in order to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the &quot; &quot; Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance &quot; &quot; in circle and a bird song im@@ plying - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe . &quot;
some demonstr@@ ators began to blow stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ arot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the Che@@ ap inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the messages about the kill@@ ings arrived only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 , that he would initiate an extra@@ judicial mechanism to address historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we are obliged to address these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such claims with a gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he is still alive in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was struck by the military when he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police shot villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , 24 year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital . &quot;
the villa@@ gers were prot@@ esting before the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident scene for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensible development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ arot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as far away .
&quot; people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a , fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot;
agriculture is the task of women to deal with four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , President of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media are ten@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported from Papua due to a lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s electoral campaign have not been realised in order to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indon@@ esian ru@@ inous provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say they will not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the leader of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the Pan@@ i@@ ai fire@@ wall cas@@ u@@ alties resulted in a final symbolic act : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fires capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest towers in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that runs through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cries of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; &quot; said an inhabit@@ ant who called his name as George , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said that they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage from facing , exterior trim for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has been killed at the Annual General Meeting with his great Davis Cup coup .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single on two wins was not supported by the two @-@ third majority required for this sport . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even therefore very pri@@ zed five @-@ set classics are preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote was , after many claims , the proposal had already been proposed to put the finale at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in the future , the fin@@ alists will be entitled to the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the first round in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training positions , etc . , will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items into the aircraft , finds a pol@@ l out &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by flight passengers concluded that more than 20 percent of deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration have passed by , among them at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they were late to discover that they were mis@@ erable with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers tend to dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; of those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were deliberately passing by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent admitted , know@@ ingly carried items with blades carried by the security control , while 2.2 per cent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they intentionally had brought forbidden drugs to the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods would have brought smu@@ g@@ gling security , and how many would have done it intentionally . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who suffer most from smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a time , the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre@@ positions for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ tuous figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time announced another less brilliant figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k is giving a dream : 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , spati@@ te Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are to be combined - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are currently available per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today must reck@@ on with the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production lines without any major disrup@@ tions at maximum capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , the in@@ consistency of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the failure of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ended on October 1 , for states to meet the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid hin@@ dering on local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ uted by President Donald Tru@@ mp of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington concluded that the EPA Administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinforced the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General Prosecutor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans , who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year . &quot;
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ itts surprising course change .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests .
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery site in Tum@@ lings will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and sponsors Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique rural gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary chapel was first mentioned in documentary documentary : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen , together with the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; on the hill of Tum@@ linger Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the Church or the patron of the patron and not the other way around . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as follows from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still to be recognized today in the village of Tum@@ lings , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the noble sett@@ lers of the village . &quot;
old maps of the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was taken from the early medieval her@@ edi@@ tary law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit this church . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two bar@@ ons at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be delivered in 1942 in the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ nants of the church threatened to crash in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the still existing tower of the tower remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen &apos;s and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as a promot@@ er , the friends and suppor@@ ter of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are invited to the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel on Sunday , July 16th . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16 : 30 .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to finish the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organisers have the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and horns . &quot;
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim for@@ bi@@ ds &quot; &quot; does not provide a legal basis for the construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim Club &quot; association has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it was illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the time in Vier@@ sen on the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration area causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the town . &quot;
such zones are meant to prevent a &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had agreed a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier , but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the granted permit is still illegal and therefore rejected , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to hold the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this position , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the district Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to the cause of re@@ viewing the matter again .
&quot; however , they are unlikely to cause the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to express itself to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four 200 metres high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , which took part in the city of Vier@@ sen , closed P@@ acht@@ contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered , which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor together : woman dies at a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was seriously injured .
two other people were slightly injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
&quot; following police declarations , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took her passenger car as a companion with her 53 year old mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer planning &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ des@@ aer and people from the region are to discover the shopping possibilities in the city in September .
&quot; the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the inhabitants of the city to the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as Chairman of the Business Association , Christian König , the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend announced that the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action not only targets residents of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
the Municipal Administration and Business Association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; thus , the industrial club and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well and sold @-@ out Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them into active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ developed . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost sight of the inner city when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , farms around the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly spread , and the king said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thurin@@ gian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of the local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with their purchasing behaviour can influence their direct surroundings themselves .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction it came to a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first mis@@ chief was also found dead later .
&quot; in the case of the dead , they were employees of the school . &quot;
&quot; as an accident , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people stayed in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp made use of pressur@@ ized tran@@ scripts from telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
the tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp asked the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull &quot; that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e rural , Georgia , and drove to the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with rif@@ les emerged to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long turn on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; cries broke down the silence , when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene played on the 22nd of July was only a reflection . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them beat out very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot;
since 2005 citizens &apos; rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ sed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organization of the reproduction . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
&quot; for him , the reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community , that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to be prosec@@ uted , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to obtain justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a judicial physician lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but nobody was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for the pres@@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , sat down during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
&quot; on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when she came down from prison and came closer to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , eliminated evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral campaign , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and it is difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened to a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona rehear@@ sed Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries and drives him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he van@@ ished from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona answers the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people said &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; yet , &quot; one of the other black actors swe@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with emphasis . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed with a dream @-@ dress , stands over the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people got sweat and tears out of their eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot;
&quot; they have seen Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms ; the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
later the audience with the actors sit together for dinner .
&quot; at a table , a white pair from Atlanta ch@@ ats about the post @-@ position with a black couple that they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words which have left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ x still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s court holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s farm at his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we do not learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous production of gigantic , six @-@ story scenery . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of this , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ kill@@ ers pose as Rock@@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; cast@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which moves through its &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ tö@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully as already in &quot; Das Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ ess seduc@@ es her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a corp@@ se into the trunk and pass the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who humble himself and form the hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my . &quot;
&quot; there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on the stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in le@@ aner casual clothing . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; in 2013 , he had still had to leave the pipe concert in 2013 , and there were five years later , in which the occasional &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls were drow@@ ned . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is looking forward to it .
&quot; one notices that the audience co @-@ grown with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where to go anywhere ?
&quot; crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at the school in the open all day .
what are your experiences with this ?
&quot; crowd : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ stage volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a construction engineer &apos;s studies , let &apos;s say , successfully demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; I know for myself that it is wrong and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; do a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see , as it may be on the spot , in the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social sciences . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably always depends where you do your FS@@ J .
one can do it from the old @-@ home to youth work - in all sorts of aspects of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs off .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; crowd : sure , here it &apos;s not about counting St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; there are always other people in the head , who have a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , a youth who has been brought out of the family - you always have to go individually to it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
crowd : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; a lot of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are negative moments , but life is so . &quot;
Pear@@ son crashes another 3.000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job reductions , announced by the Director General John Fall@@ on , for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , also comes to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program a plan for cost reduction of another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business , which was hit by a quick step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after the first half of the year having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack killed by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and declared Nato &apos;s declaration .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the near B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they were running this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 forced the Taliban from power . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay Obama &apos;s government , for which the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday that the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Requi@@ rements 2015 &quot; &quot; and said that they show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and to respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations in which , in part of the country , pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with Colombia &apos;s district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a broad range of environmental regulations that the former President Barack Obama imposed , as part of a wider agenda that plans to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the demo@@ crats and conservation groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and strengthening the respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
Municipal Council wants community space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds decides to set up a community space in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot of land was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; although it will still last until the area belonging to the church community is still in possession of the parish , there is now no planning permission for the project to be directed by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration , and the majority of the council , flo@@ ats in front of such a community space not to be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the fair living , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current household in the last fall , will be missed by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , thus , reports T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposal sees to sign@@ alize to the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding area - as well as the roof @-@ mounted roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela call points to the many own buildings with which one does not come so far , but now you lean on the community space out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m difficult with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but a real , in doubt market@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s proposal to ple@@ ad according to the proposal , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counter @-@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we grasp the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision by car : cycl@@ ist is ej@@ ected on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and badly injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police communicated , the 82 year old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road by 12@@ 20 with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer path from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger driver in the same direction allowed him to take preced@@ ence .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he apparently did not notice the traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that headed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat car .
FC Bayern Munich has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
staff members at the German soccer record master Bayern München become ever bigger at the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has managed the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his crew . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
that was not good last . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to be intelligent , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , &quot; a difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights catches the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the resin of star walk to star
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; meets the need for information in many of the Har@@ z@@ est visitors . &quot;
&quot; it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question come from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the panels should be complemented by internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star Path train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star was more light than another , although it was far more distant . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; the association already operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary weg path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the plug @-@ to @-@ d@@ warf @-@ planet degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale from one to two billion .
&quot; the earth thus shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is at a good distance of four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from the sun up to the Plu@@ to needs about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last another half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who are in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ weight Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision about the former Four Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas re@@ marked that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot;
&quot; I have risen for bronze &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to get down to light weight .
and he must move to lightweight counter@@ s &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who will also be interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly volunte@@ ered to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he liked Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a tremendous fighter , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday &apos;s fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks , the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
they both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded to tire plat@@ ter
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point market wide . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it was over@@ thrown and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , and then traffic on the left road was passed by the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defense formation in Au@@ e points adds . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , there would not have been the two ad@@ versaries at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two ad@@ versaries too much , and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized .
&quot; and a fool , after a stum@@ bling block , did not want to capture the For@@ tun@@ en any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in the preparation with the three @-@ chain @-@ chain better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his case , &quot; because we are in the three chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we do even better harmon@@ ize and do not afford so many ab@@ norm@@ alities in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ fu@@ cking start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I only judge the start into the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over the eyes of Au@@ e , because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her , as they have no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascent favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the inner defender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland act as a lighter favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep it away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive for only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ Medi@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take the assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish migration authority ( migration cab@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees that were minor . &quot;
&quot; until today , migration can be sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may &quot; be under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see any big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; suggest that the aged person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to evaluate the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the road @-@ making department and traffic in the government of the government of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began at the same time at all three renovated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach brook .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap received .
this is a marginal fixation that is also used as operating mode .
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is going to go .
&quot; the special thing about it is that there are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .
&quot; in the run @-@ up to the project , local residents were informed about the project . &quot;
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ bs first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the collection point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the costs for the three brid@@ les are 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so often that parties pull in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is hard to bring under one hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Circle of Vol@@ can@@ ines ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites you to the poster &quot; &quot; Grand election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel stays colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , really rejo@@ iced : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel reports that he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ ere is happy that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at 8 o &apos;clock , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting to see the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k holding their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ ast@@ le have a longer breath , but also there will be announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special occur@@ ren@@ ces .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available tomorrow , Sunday at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;

Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symph@@ on@@ ie@@ orchester .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this part of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gri@@ lling cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart very open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , she ass@@ ures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone who I had . &quot;
&quot; or do you think you , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and believed Du@@ alism . &quot;
so it never confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; she especially suffered during the school time when she liked dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the public does not like to explain to their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some describe me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot;
today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of reflections ... today I will tell you as inhabit@@ ant of West Virginia I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor .
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally earlier .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business . &quot;
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a declaration on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would prevent us from working as it would work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of the Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an evident ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again . &quot;
&quot; Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in gold and silver medals in competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; the whole council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some very hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he is also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that start Friday in London in accordance with the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfil some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
acts of mour@@ ning for soldiers crashed in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two soldiers in Mali have thought about soldiers arriving at a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; to the still un@@ explained crash , Defense Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two inver@@ ted pilots , however , as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down before this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the grape @-@ gro@@ ats laid down roses , the relatives were standing arm in arms on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ quired soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and lonely . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann was built in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers in his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if the crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen did not show any doubts : the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; for a country that we are separated from only by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , doesn &apos;t want to be buried next to his wife . &quot;
that was what the King &apos;s house distributed on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral Church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also dis@@ covers the title &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he doesn &apos;t see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cracy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; while his later wife inter@@ tw@@ ined the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es in his 50 @-@ year @-@ old reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of corporate critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
that was two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to make a quick new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because speaking on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament .
&quot; prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the election of the country , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the CD@@ U and F@@ DP opposition . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ aked founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats together in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; until now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be announced on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green national government must now decide whether they could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag prefers to trust the prime minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally clean@@ sed , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally checked . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; but a little curious . &quot;
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory de@@ pu@@ ties for the return of their country parliament .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has given her Land@@ tag mandate , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; shared the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we greatly depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ SCH . &quot;
she decided not to speak any pron@@ oun@@ cements in the group .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survi@@ vor of the Green MP El@@ ke T@@ SCH to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not just betra@@ yal to the voters , but also treas@@ on to red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Social @-@ Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the Austr@@ itt T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian in her last vanity and fru@@ stration in her fru@@ stration of the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony particip@@ ates in this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to make it political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Director Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U El@@ ke T@@ jackets .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , raised the result of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD strongest force , SPD and Green had a very thin majority of one vote in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum divi@@ ders , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal occur ?
how consumers can protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks and answers in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge carefully and check stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ foodstuffs war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states present the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the concern of Germany . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; in the same way as the manufacturers , the trade has to ensure that the sold products are transport@@ able and harmless . &quot;
&quot; if the residual content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , they are non @-@ transport@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the farms are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , the production plants are not responsible for any direct debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few controllers in the incident . &quot;
is it lacking only on staff or also for the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; precisely because of this , a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be received are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clari@@ fication by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; through the pan@@ ed agent , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food delivery animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , it has to be worked out consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be promptly clari@@ fied .
how the financial rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record transfer from Spain to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , means that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without any major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign up and bring it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the rich royal family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but must be counter@@ acted by legitimate income sources that allow them to take the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who in their quest for success had taken enormous debts , effectively che@@ ered and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to the surveillance of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch , originally used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder task . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P trial period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presi@@ dency in 2015 by the Pres@@ i@@ dency , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat @-@ rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption sum can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P @-@ sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season Champions League were limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to persu@@ ade their financial supervision by blowing up their income through companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ arian company sponsors PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will be ambass@@ adors and can easily find such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday told the people who were familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million achieved a profit of more than € 10 million .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made Fre@@ y board cho@@ col@@ ates for the Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet co @-@ operation is available before a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order . &quot;
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request by the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the latest supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small , red and white shells packed for 14 grams are distributed every year before landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss does not want to provide any information about the cost .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; but more importantly , the advertising impact is always more important : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer . &quot;
Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the number of applicants for the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y intends to pursue a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss chocolate tablets have been distributed on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

nostal@@ gia starts in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s years , for the 90 years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter walked the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a promising jar of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children who will grow - they nevertheless managed to win the im@@ possibility of reg@@ ain@@ ing the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the am@@ i@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy vi@@ cious plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ines of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could invoke this fran@@ chise like a repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieves this as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his east @-@ west @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two police officers , two officers from Buchar@@ est who are fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dialo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful G@@ ags for watching ( the police spends the time watching chess on TV how Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it &apos;s gone , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ di@@ pped to a lower length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ ote a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police hit the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 convic@@ tions were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts had already been issued against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same time ra@@ ids in Italy were arrested , two persons were arrested . &quot;
&quot; against the two suspi@@ cious Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office established Kon@@ stanz against the organized drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Crime Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the great effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in view of the investigations , mainly Italian nation@@ als with a close reference to the Italian Ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
&quot; in a way , large gaps in the for@@ eigner registers lam@@ ent &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign registry in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data was not sufficiently well maintained , data quality in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 was found in individual cases , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the Register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow down processes considerably , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in statistics on sufficient persons , EU citizens are also included , which would not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; however , such incorrect assignments led &quot; to a distorted debate on dealing with adequate noti@@ ons , &quot; that is , in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they entered . &quot;
&quot; this is what emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this paper , it is said that BA@@ MF re@@ members such procedures for families with children , with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin Agreement , it is in charge of refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the ri@@ pen@@ ess of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the ministry now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening because of the lack in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot;
at least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his now 100 donations now donated 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors , who make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district editor of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn bun@@ ches reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the D@@ RK district leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ rel were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 blood don@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when they kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in their quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % for 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that inflation would likely increase to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the coming years to get the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s business package , which was published a year after Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the GDP ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be required for cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; slightly greater &quot; &quot; extent than markets await . &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the down@@ wards corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound after these messages fell opposite the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations for an interest rate increase , and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offers little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; income from the coming years , &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the lowering of the pounds . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably last for four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last ruling of the Bank on interest rates , the call for an interest rate rose since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding a rise to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will be tigh@@ tened again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the excess in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Managing Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent swa@@ p rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders want to search for businesses and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those in which the existing de@@ als exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service to a first three @-@ year study for 10,000 people . &quot;
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; the ch@@ ute announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England &apos;s chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to include the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in case of infection at risk .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means to take that just enough medications are present in a person &apos;s body to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified that agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competition .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale , taken up and implemented . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted on needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with a high HIV @-@ risk approach will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; priority must now be that the study will be conducted quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced itself to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely refurbished . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to solve the announcement . &quot;
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , there are mirr@@ ored units for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is important so that when you push the door up , it is very easy gli@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and will carry out a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials , giving the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not fall into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , as i@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city area , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - described about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns the value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but throws Paul off to manage some possessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in Col@@ in &apos;s first case . &quot;
Col@@ in says that he began west co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to disclose her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claiming that marks were paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , thus Paul says , &quot; em@@ bit@@ tered on the conditions of its financial separation . &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept himself very back even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw up our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight , &quot; he said , and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff at his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House which he wanted to repair : poor information that comes into the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship to television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was angry due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping the Tru@@ mp Twitter habits under control , according to six former election campaigns , is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp t@@ witter was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more ignition material without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp didn &apos;t broadcast .
&quot; if his co @-@ workers have managed to keep his anger away from him , their efforts were worth it . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevented it , that Tru@@ mp controversi@@ es out . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors , to the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with le@@ aks le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone voluntarily accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief cler@@ k K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; to be the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , attempted to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his couns@@ ell@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the people is requested and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals this summer ( virtual ) postcards on the flight .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent cal@@ ender from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting to vacation destinations hide , it was called by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
we have compiled 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online fut@@ ures have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a tren@@ ch and return to &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back again with some determined travellers on the foot of war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug out by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and were moved on and are back now .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot stop it .
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised repository on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
&quot; the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1st , next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through its former Ambiente company mbH on the 13th of April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year , as well as income from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees entering the district , the hotel building was offered as a gathering accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented asylum seekers from establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time . &quot;
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with CEO Birgit Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a House of the Three @-@ Star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building construction waste containers before the entrance , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partially disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer talking to our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; later on , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; the swimming pool , the wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level downtown @-@ level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to grow wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the city &apos;s performances are similar to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the external units are also brought to the front , which is clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which is accessible to the public by the restaurant . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Agency puts a jury on the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in the past few weeks , the Panel has recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; on appeal to people entrusted with the matter . &quot;
the paper was taking the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations .
&quot; the broad@@ caster CN@@ N reported that there are already initial proposals of the Gre@@ mi@@ um , in connection with a meeting between the shri@@ mps of the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies have been bl@@ aming the Krem@@ lin for more specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mps election campaign and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ s in the election campaign .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more Tru@@ mp &apos;s private and commercial environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Represent@@ ative Tru@@ mp had personally moved into the centre and for@@ et@@ old whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise charges .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also referred to as charges . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Council may also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for interro@@ gation under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N broad@@ caster , there were already demonstrations that revol@@ ved around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who participated in the meeting were asked to be a statement in the report .
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. Tru@@ mps were also advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his dam leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , it would be quick to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up being turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the Gre@@ mi@@ um at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President , on Thursday evening , used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the subject gives the Democrats a chance to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about .
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; this work , however , usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House ad@@ ministers any action that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the special investig@@ ator in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI director James Com@@ ey had said three times that not against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was explained in the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller had only been used after being fired after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey , in June , said before a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and his staff . &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be released .
&quot; unlike an independent spokes@@ man of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the former president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on ad@@ versaries of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators set out on Thursday , on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be released so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the nearly seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the shelf . &quot;
that shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the large @-@ scale and 5@@ 800 @-@ square @-@ kilometer large col@@ os@@ sus now drive north@@ wards and probably would need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice col@@ ds that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; according to research information , to what extent climate change has played a role in the decline of the ic@@ e@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ t was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ ter so far .
ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ ter is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; north of this shelf , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete sc@@ arf is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a good talk that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ ter is in danger , because the front edge has never pulled as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
melting of shell@@ fish and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice the ice as much water as it produces after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could increase the sea level , albeit only to a small degree , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ess@@ s is the fourth biggest sh@@ elling of Antar@@ cti@@ ca after A@@ WI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ e@@ plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen C shelf will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly gather together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not return this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , in recent decades many ice @-@ cre@@ ams of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart . &quot;
this long tip of the Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the temperature rise has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated by around three degrees over the past 50 years , and therefore counts among the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls forth from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new places in the administration got stuck in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have had their first working day behind them . &quot;
the courses in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be recorded for this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle lacks staff to cope with the increasing demands and tasks . &quot;
there are currently no occupied areas in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; among other things , physicians and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , would like to take the initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , point out concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an education offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one previously didn &apos;t know .
other cities adverti@@ se good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is by a regular &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age from the service . &quot;
&quot; high time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Koch , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long since made a fist surprise in the day of the day for a lazy surprise , when he publicly questioned the personal cost coverage and the other parties were ast@@ o@@ unded . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be reviewed that allow an exit from the local employer association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; &quot; says people . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials , tries to pay better than fores@@ een the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money are only available if one changes to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the sound of NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti said in an interview with the tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; because their squ@@ ad effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself too detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew will ship din@@ gh@@ y migrants , delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as I@@ u@@ v@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board , who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code , Save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy have declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and the cooperation with local citizens have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and places of interest . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ alls of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .
&quot; there followed observation points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer Forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , viewpoint at the lookout point , connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many metres of altitude were announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium healing Sole . &quot;
also Neustadt was headed .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 meters in altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; the sport stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , rather than cont@@ acting with wind and weather over the stadium . &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges . &quot;
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine which are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the beginning was 2015 V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 signed . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; There are still some clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Federation FIFA in London is organizing the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have been qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .

&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could much more often be present on these markets than just once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; will be challenged at the competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long established itself in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and for the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sports is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been confronted with the question .
&quot; for Professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and take care of the diet .
the f@@ ading player is a good player .
&quot; however , f@@ rob@@ ers also have problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; checks are difficult for online gaming , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; this is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , though . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
large markets are Asia and the USA where Ex basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports betting providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the ancient times , no longer suff@@ ice today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
one cannot cling to that only when football is all the way it always was .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced for suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were subjected to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and facing down eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not occupy the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity , to be there for his sisters , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would be &quot; &quot; prosec@@ uted &quot; &quot; that she would never attend her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt to his children . &quot;
&quot; no more to have this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that they encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; All you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was tried by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that they should profit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder at her British co @-@ inhabit@@ ant in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain during the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern tr@@ ys a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation is not hur@@ ting there .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua k@@ im@@ me immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his split up to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first bet as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the console could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could interpret Kim@@ me as well .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game guide for professionals from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from holidays , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed to those whom you want a lot , you want to keep in a mood . &quot;
those who have been chosen to compete with L@@ ie &apos;s legacy can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ mich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and in general Kim@@ me worked in this initial formation , like the one who can also best take the helm . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ occupied troops . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy themselves . &quot;
&quot; vi@@ dal to super@@ v@@ ise his missing fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip ( folding also limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t , do not fall negative . &quot;
that all worked out quite well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran next to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy from the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ ver also tried to make a successful attempt to build a game for a couple of times . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy said that the outcome was &quot; not what we hoped for . &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; playing storage , tempo change : &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot;
&quot; how un@@ familiar this Bayern world is still for the new arri@@ vals , one looked after the game afterwards . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not include one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has been reported to be on Twitter just before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies wish all the best .
&quot; the Bavarian Legi@@ on@@ ary is basically a club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B captain , Schn@@ ader@@ beck and with our La@@ dies . &quot;
the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ating sy@@ ringe .
&quot; the famous Bavaria @-@ Dus@@ el might well need our ladies , too . &quot;
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business lo@@ dges Wis@@ d@@ ress@@ ings Tempo
&quot; it often proved irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old ministers .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing handles the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
nat@@ us sees the largest turn@@ around in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au highway between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 will be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank of Trier , which stands in the pre@@ pressing need of the federal road@@ map . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ori spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees it as a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) , Trier , aims to create a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label with the wine , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Trier Chamber of Cra@@ fts sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the passed Master &apos;s exam and 2500 euros , if graduates within ten years after the master education do themselves autonom@@ ously . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains however long .
&quot; with the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly ; at the same time it is out of the country necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce Trier . &quot;
&quot; so far , from 56 new engineers who want to set up Wis@@ ser in the country &apos;s country of mobility , 29 jobs have been occupied until now . &quot;
the Chamber calls for more orders to be assigned to external offices .
&quot; for this purpose , CD@@ U faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country investing in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads as proposed . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; in addition , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also not@@ e@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a grade of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
former economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits at the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months , she already cleared the field again for dis@@ agreements . &quot;
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair@@ woman said that &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and was referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on - bann@@ ing or limiting diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will be modi@@ fying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
&quot; but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising emissions from exhaust f@@ umes , also makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the problems of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors also participate , on tomorrow &apos;s Saturday a raft ride through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if it moves on Saturday again to the Is@@ ar , a big raft will be seen there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the construction paper wants to be clari@@ fied .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen the wild river . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft went over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and laugh@@ ing against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon animations , the no@@ od@@ les of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still draws and works on a film . &quot;
his message : laughter because there is too much suffering in the world .
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he , among other things , suggested himself as a drawer for congrat@@ ul@@ atory cards - which brought him frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures rom@@ p in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own statements , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ l@@ ligen figures continue to find much spread worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series for six years with his figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los arbitrary animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ ander as a counter@@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo says . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the insects that are reminded of drought , and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , are preparing large head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute , said : &quot; &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change in the last years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on la@@ ven@@ der lifetime .
&quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ad , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing down the evap@@ oration of the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in Thurin@@ gia celebrates its 1200 year anniversary .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the goal of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings are enough . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from violence , and while all over the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is now more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we are bl@@ aming everyone . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he just managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ level m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes to the United States .
&quot; nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , February saw the release of an interview with Dam@@ ez Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , the aisle members suspected of buying any copy of the issue , as soon as they were extra@@ di@@ ted to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country on its own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US @-@ Dollar shar@@ ehol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting tests without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you have as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the fool .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was like a port worker , who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now ask them , &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine be his destruction ? &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
to trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the space in which the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who called the Gover@@ nor himself un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has kept on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on the government spending concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it was done , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , readers viewed the Val@@ dez column as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ dly ph@@ ased by written &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; in organised protests and constructions . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of picking up journalists and letting them move because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she be re@@ divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a &quot; &quot; equ@@ itable society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces that are hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; media group has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as it did El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that the drug trade was frigh@@ tened by him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat in front of the office and drank beer , when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to sum up . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan &apos;s seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the edge of the board , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ten near to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think of closing , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her reports to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid its enemies
&quot; at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening one . &quot;
researchers have now found that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ o of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts have described it as a &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that its fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the captured din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he met something about the surrounding rock out of the square , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
&quot; the fossil , discovered by him , was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the £ 2500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) .
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you smile only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has been sleeping , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; researchers have discovered that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , even though it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing shell , probably is threatened by meat e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a screening technique known as counter @-@ protection , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ aded shade , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by eating enough din@@ osau@@ rs by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rus car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been the cycle time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his preserved dar@@ min@@ ate to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ Flo@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried in the sea after death and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the woo@@ ded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were approximately 18 feet long ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the cre@@ denti@@ als of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin @-@ st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ or plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in Lotto . &quot;
&quot; the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the hol@@ lowed ar@@ mor@@ ed plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot rests on his side , his five fingers crossed to the top . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .
thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilometres long bars - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late th@@ urs@@ day afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police were around 17@@ .00 hrs between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information is available about the exact number of injured . &quot;
&quot; it is an easy to moderate injury , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot;
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the crash site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in direction to Munich .
&quot; in the Munich direction of travel , an approximately ten kilometres long retreat was formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also a massive disability on the counter @-@ track - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade picked up the hall@@ marks of the vehicle drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pun@@ ishments . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ing .
the conductor comes and ar@@ ouses a uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your place and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long distance routes in Germany , &quot; said a rail speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the railway the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : you enter the train , call his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passengers X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket control at place Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with a value @-@ made online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can sleep further , continue to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the course - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket inspection through our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navigator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB remote marketing director . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in the control of one &apos;s ticket and takes time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post of someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s active body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be a Brow@@ ns father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation , which they had &quot; &quot; over the black experience and the black state &quot; &quot; many times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for it , what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to be free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black woman child . &quot;
&quot; I feel that I would show you a bad service , to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter connected with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they before and helped them to pass on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said that she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to only &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
a question came into the mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of ?
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often white @-@ in a community who benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ ki@@ kt occup@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for so I am going to be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; reveal surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , how she falls in love and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; at Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the front of the front because with a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist ties between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;

from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although they are not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct spl@@ its the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the topic hardly leaves one . &quot;
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; no man needs &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the other shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ ed out . &quot;
&quot; added to this : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farm hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , there will be an end . &quot;
&quot; the Galerie @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - at Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farmers market hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women gladly again and again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there is also this in other cities .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall sett@@ les in the gallery arrives at the height of the rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what to do in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of that in our city .
&quot; one sees however , how many shops are empty here - some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special deals do not exist any more and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t suit me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the farmers market hall should go there during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already manage to drive all stores out of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmers market is ruined , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ conspic@@ uous , hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 year prison sentence after she made public diplom@@ ats published secretly on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on August 2nd , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years &quot; correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been openly convic@@ ted of identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ gers Visi@@ ons . &quot; &quot;
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette bl@@ acks and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they had an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while being in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t visit her and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal British customers who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert Russia &apos;s judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing released Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able paths in order to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions , which he really should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing led with her excessive signature ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for who we are and how openly they are genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above . &quot;
she shows man@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand from the disciplinary bra@@ ins of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; if they leave your words cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , never hold your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greetings from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing did not see the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing
a national hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who will be looked after as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corp@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead for dead , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them would now be in a review and had been excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ators in every conceivable way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he would strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian prime minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA driving plan to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and has recently been published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that may cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , is that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the publicly sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov made problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving in the right direction to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
they shared the group &apos;s groups .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tionary measure , it could not further be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ sem@@ ic anti @-@ L@@ utter . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to be lucky with your staff at your e @-@ commerce startup , but the p@@ olls did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to offer surveys , special groups and demographic groups to offer employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure commitment . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel during the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low authorisation results - so you can drill down why . &quot;
companies come to see that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture so that you do not have to become the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished .
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , after the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amidst the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables Con@@ ver@@ cent companies to send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its employees treat or behave in@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that Con@@ ver@@ cent is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair plac@@ ements - were identified and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments . &quot;
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices and that the work you do is well worth doing , then they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which has both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t used . &quot;
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture are important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
&quot; indeed , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can motiv@@ ate and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you will need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow employees , &quot; &quot; Di@@ d you really listen to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and who you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who is now performing monthly surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported by G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond between employees in a sector that is known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are enter@@ tained on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three hour exercise , before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning . &quot;
&quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to match the previously packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the brood at the beginning of the camp postpon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school led to the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in practical exercises .
&quot; 20 before the formal preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September , 20 are scheduled to stop . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if it adds another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they pl@@ under on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which has already been thrown into a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been tos@@ sed with foot@@ balls , which is not an easy task behind a door@@ post . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel starting this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that the people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces in Parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folders from third parties and display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and send them to fak@@ ed inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks , if they do not succeed in removing hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the election there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the recognition of the stories of fak@@ ers of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat at the River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England takes the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac handle@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to a letter of thumb on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters always smell for smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives , and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust has received full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; &quot; hundreds of years where aristo@@ crats said &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it up on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards depicting what had : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , telling the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter that the family Dar@@ rel@@ l had hidden for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , represented by the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , getting debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ males solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them to adverti@@ se me as a he@@ ap of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se . &quot;
&quot; after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the territory of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which since then has been challenged by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the release of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( panoramic view of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team intend to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it will be the highlight of the campaign to be a festival on the Island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the cre@@ ators of the action have been asking the posters on the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we do not really think that ( of course ! ) , write them on their yesterday &apos;s shared website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; with the action , it &apos;s more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other local authorities . &quot;
a mean five @-@ digit amount will cost the City of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presi@@ dency of the government , the five Deputy Prime Minister as well as the Minister of Defence , In@@ ner , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the consultations . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in number . &quot;
the government is moving the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; true Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Navy were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of State Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as clin@@ cher of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who should have been directly involved in the attempted put@@ sch , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the overthrow as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the he@@ ath ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale invasion of the army and the security forces continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent a further 7@@ 3@@ 95 state aid to Erdo@@ gan , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to g@@ rie@@ ve earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan supp@@ ressed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the European Union reforms . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan dri@@ fted ahead of an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a non @-@ named officer , who was seeking asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries , was seeking to be the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and o@@ int@@ ments . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not let Nato get cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens from other countries are issuing Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the Candi@@ dates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate road for racing lane shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months have been argu@@ ing about the future of the Race Board of Directors - now it should go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the mar@@ ches track on which the tourist railway runs . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is scheduled to start this year in order to secure the future of the race car fleet in the long term . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is dedicated to the most important connection for tourism , &quot; declared Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of servicing the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country will exceed 75 per cent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle should be ordered in the future from the country , is currently defini@@ tively coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; that way , the racing shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017 . &quot;
the track shuttle is a popular railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in recent months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by enough people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is strongly b@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it could not become more crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots comes . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would have a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , if one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here is : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a withdrawal from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what se@@ eps through the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted women to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the dev@@ out bodies and the po@@ ked eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ ju@@ gation . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relatives . &quot;
we are all re@@ port@@ edly committed to bur@@ sting our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mps to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ directed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with whom she fought for decades , suddenly and quite strange on the same page . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but I am in a further context that this also ent@@ ails significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the stell@@ ar effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the great possibility that one day it will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; in the Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appears as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with his standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the Cra@@ zy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ el of the New York park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals revol@@ ve to see full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the city &apos;s reality will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a visit to hospital . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hands , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced for murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first man@@ slaughter .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilets in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly inv@@ ader who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal by which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cut@@ ters from F@@ yers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
school leader An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; as a symbol of school discharge , the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle growing up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Mall@@ ard Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
instead of a chicken box a small eagle came out .
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken from him was sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes displayed three and four in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank &apos;s studies . &quot;
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les who bore cylinders to the bet .
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but they belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every district collector to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; there followed thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps at instruc@@ tional pas@@ sports , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she only reli@@ eves her students because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ point system . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer@@ time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight original c@@ utt@@ ings are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally @-@ ro@@ aming people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have intensified the control of the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; in the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the emission performance of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe there are assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no . the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but no exact date is yet available . &quot;
Daimler has announced that it should be registered to anyone affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fits be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the hang@@ ings from the company &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the autom@@ akers are not acting on the environment so far . &quot;
how long does it take to update ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , driving a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;
the ACE advises to wait .
&quot; foreign manufacturers probably would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is there a massive price decline of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but even in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
&quot; in rural areas , there is no loss of value for older diesel engines . &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .

the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ar winner , which has been announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would refrain from taking part in the gala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; New York Times , &quot; he said , &quot; This Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make her view clearer . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the biggest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the previous winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the job is already out @-@ of @-@ date , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been . &quot;
and the work is still great fun for him as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it wonders that no application has fulfilled the requirement profile so far . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; thus , under consideration of the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a re@@ development . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ building authority , the applicant must provide appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to complete it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and the city itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between the authority and the citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in the office , a number of important projects have accumulated , looking back to the wi@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; he is sure about the building office and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ yard parking lot have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will come to book with around € 1.5 million , &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city building master there is plenty of room for manoeu@@ vre .
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , much can be flexibly responded to much . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the creation of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is pure &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphasizes the out@@ going city construction master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city builder has a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for the past ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been there for the past 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important to a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker should have completed studies as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law .
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt subordin@@ ates high and civil engineering , building control planning , management of urban properties , urban premises with building yard and gar@@ dener , as well as the Lower Building Law Office , including monuments conservation . &quot;
bike is thrown on lines : frozen section of the ground
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line transfer in the area of the Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , witnesses were witnessed by a ros@@ ary and a bicycle rider . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a &quot; &quot; Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , had brought themselves in great peri@@ l and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the South railway line could be managed without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten passenger vessels were out on Friday morning , two of them entered the long distance . &quot;
&quot; freight trains failed , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 yards had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease may result . &quot;
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet promotes less inflammatory bow@@ mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also enter@@ tains with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but that had not been accommodated , did not have this . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial strains of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually living in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice failed . &quot;
mice were put up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given to L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
&quot; when the active component has been cleaned from the fluid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabol@@ ism known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts at Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role , as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira pre @-@ mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic , however , had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asian tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started at the Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent in this week warned that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to meet three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , for that I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they are four out of four , but they have much trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Mich@@ igan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing has already made such advertisement earlier .
&quot; the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind spins : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections . &quot;
&quot; just no j@@ amm@@ ers from the party central party , but no opposite wind from the covenant - was the most important desire of the election warri@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff members from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with a counter wind in the approach . &quot;
there were deep @-@ hits .
and one after the other .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising faction leaving a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the election of the country , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority against the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Party Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous Dutch Green MP El@@ ke T@@ west@@ ruck to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west@@ ruck must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the German Federal Managing Director and election campaign leader of the Green Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; however , this must not be true , &quot; si@@ ghs an SPD elec@@ torate , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message has reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there after passing the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ wick@@ a to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what is next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , not more , the comrades reas@@ sured at his time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was , and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into num@@ bing , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after , the comrades pain@@ stak@@ ingly ra@@ ced up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his ni@@ bus because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he wrong@@ ly made everything wrong , which can be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for its political survival . &quot;
&quot; so , now also Stephan Wei@@ l . &quot;
&quot; because of the VW exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already stood in criticism for quite some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese change@@ over@@ s were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Because in the past weeks Because , Because in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former Mayor of Hannover , his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
they let him grant him because they promised Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , essentially , not a fault . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; her anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ SCH puts her own career in the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ akes has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person as a direct candidate , but has also been elected by the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , CEO of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins a &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters wil@@ der four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate for the German Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or gave further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local core III
&quot; who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; over this , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back to what is happening . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in sensi@@ tivities .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings are a &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the development of the interior and not only open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government presi@@ dium of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a remedi@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount will amount to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , including 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue to investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .
&quot; if necessary , the area limits may then also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government program &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; , &quot; in which the refurb@@ ishment would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living conditions and working conditions , and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per plot . &quot;
the re@@ development area would then eventually be set as statute .
the period of approval for the funding has been in operation since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the stock intake would only be carried out in the framework of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the statute of sentences is to be carried out in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each municipality would have to carry out the preliminary investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of assessing and deciding when , when it is being renovated and to what extent . &quot;
&quot; for the respective property , a remedi@@ ation note is also registered in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to mind again and take a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the Yellow Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; Building and Property Sec@@ tor &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; household and apartment &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating arch &quot; is only to be filled out if there are commercial premises in the building .
&quot; however , please note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire does not at the same time apply for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler insi@@ sted that the distribution of the funding according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; was working - whoever comes first , first ad@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; one cannot afford to &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the participants &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British inventor makes himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his Bio@@ Te@@ q company . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ er in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology is similar to a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a supplement of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father from one now installed both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is on the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
&quot; the White House decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military information left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products of all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ fighter from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi for@@ klift . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the helicopter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was necessary . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could violate the destination .
&quot; a question we posed was whether it was a breach of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; the deputy commander replied . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
President is obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the presidential airplane was station@@ ed in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential airplane . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to deal with the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter sets .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 training land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
recording of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement sets is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter &apos;s commitment to the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; it is , of course , appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and was jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
leader of the second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga joins the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V in Kiel .
&quot; despite the five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable , the leader of the second tennis league has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent in any case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation . &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high north mainly provide class and stability for the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es during the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be hard for us as ever .
you also need a good bit of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; in the event of the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , which is playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec in the Czech Liber@@ ec , will play its first bet in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated ch@@ illi Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories over the last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also be back in the team . &quot;
&quot; it is sufficient for the 18 year old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , not filling someone from the trainer for Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp did not really be happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the congress contained a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US thrust . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plan to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines to the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from home O@@ MV , who are co @-@ financed with other European firms , are being co @-@ financed with the construction of the North Stream 2 Russian East Coast . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions even by executive orders . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; has viewed which of the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him .
&quot; Nar@@ cos season 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved into the center of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos that revealed Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Kil@@ ler , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not over yet . &quot;
&quot; the squ@@ ads three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four mighty god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities , to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
reel backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the municipal nursery facilities .
&quot; on 1 September , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nursery facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back into self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked is continued out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task , and provides fresh cooled refriger@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the fields of 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year &apos;s Kit@@ a@@ Year 2,@@ 800 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children attended 45 hours of the week , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces from 1 September kitchen service : they heat the delivered food , supplement them for salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tage the meal individually , give the food out , clear away , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a &quot; &quot; k@@ ita &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the &quot; &quot; K@@ ita @-@ Team &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied . &quot;
so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts .
because it is also about eating healthy eating and cooking .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen , also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical , is the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , even though 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 people , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy is dependent on the political role of women , the UN says : &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all the members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , deputy head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will run at the council elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ rated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble when women fully participate and be included in all parts of the choice process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ ti@@ lities to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to power in peace from a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

&quot; according to the police information , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 14.@@ 55 , because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , however , rejected the request and continued with her friends . &quot;
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the hand@@ bag and the necklace of the girl , which however failed . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
&quot; in the case of managers of the bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union wants to make sure about the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow &apos;s Glasgow plant . &quot;
G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie claimed that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of ra@@ bies , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan area of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continually review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not rel@@ inqu@@ ish an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago against the record raid ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan board insi@@ sted that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world been warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line and the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter turned and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , a well @-@ known perpetr@@ ator intentionally dropped a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damage of more than 200 euros . &quot;

&quot; because he met a car in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW tour and tou@@ ted the lead plan . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him in his lane , so he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the lead plan . &quot;
&quot; in the car , property damage was developed . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
according to the accident offen@@ ders it can be good that the mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother George R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse falls reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to provide discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are a church , &quot; announced after publication of the former Regensburg Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican magazine &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that there was &quot; two measure &quot; in reporting on violence . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the violations in Regensburg , no one has to deal with &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which must be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows had been a very normal pedago@@ gical remedy , &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on abuse , often Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared . &quot;
&quot; totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger wrote the memory of &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ esti@@ cks sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , said : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that R. Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has in many cases been applied to forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with great emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , many victims were estimated to be the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories join with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reli@@ eved its opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violent exercise at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; has a contradictory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many disciples raise their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible when a cathedral atz did not bring any top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is generally found therein . &quot;
&quot; he is dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or mi@@ stress in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , too , took place outside of its sphere of influence . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to ask him at best , to experience it too late , or to have taken first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all the respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents an excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which led to wak@@ efulness . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key and the key on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ cow@@ ards and too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he has already been given years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually is in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the external acts of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; one wonders , if it is not more familiar with his fame and role as Benedi@@ ct XVI &apos;s brother , that many media have just crashed on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many people who have never understood him are still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media in connection with the report very much was reported about abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also be responsible for any involvement or involvement with sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the domain master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said a person to the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral conductor , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a qui@@ eted disciple put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that thought out to him ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive or clearer or even more likely to have opened than towards their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any co @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as it unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses of violence &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former master @-@ master , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is accused of being accused of being &quot; &quot; throwing away &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything mixed and mixed up was mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
&quot; in fact , there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cath@@ ed@@ r@@ als , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let &apos;s say , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. four decades ago , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the dom@@ esti@@ cated cats . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were brut@@ ally har@@ assed and painted , and suffered from it , all of them arose at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there have been really sc@@ andal@@ ous states . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he had only to face the boys when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the gymn@@ as@@ tics gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be seen . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger conf@@ use his ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points to it , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; already given the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as a criminal record had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the affected might have been exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
what do you think ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; fall @-@ stri@@ de , &quot; that is to say , the danger of past today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right there .
&quot; but , of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and also not for what has been broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s pra@@ w@@ ns , which goes far beyond the practice at that time . &quot;
this is all very terrible and I am glad that it will finally work .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. to draw ear@@ ths and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has George R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic of testing also be applied to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s all about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , that the dom@@ es played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not conc@@ eal that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ bons alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys are now no big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger experience in the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : because of the work on the book and beyond that I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , deep @-@ gra@@ cious , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former dom@@ es , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ti@@ tion , visit him , read it - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
those who have not yet forgiven him until today are clearly in the minority .
&quot; most of the dom@@ inions are grateful to him today , that he has enriched her life and brought to them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always has a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up and worship them today . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly : all you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the resist@@ or would command a 93 @-@ year old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps even Germany , no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
