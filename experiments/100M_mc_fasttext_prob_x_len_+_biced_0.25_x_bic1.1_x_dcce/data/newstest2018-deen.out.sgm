<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel where now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the big picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called primitive positions, were incorporated for cities and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian survey management, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first surveying."</seg>
<seg id="14">Their client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the spring of 1800, the French army guide occupied Bavaria with Austria during the Second Coalition War."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops ended with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph pushed forward the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urposiblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of early / Today is most impressive, in the example of the state capital."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the" "Untersendling", "which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming appears a smaller-section card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbers numbered from the so-called" "Urinary" "from which the land tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots today no longer occupy farmers anymore - but gardeners of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, which had been the venue of the October Festival in 1810, was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one is reading not only the street name" "am Gasteig" "or" "On the skies" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people once locked up with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüfte" "was established there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden initiated the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the anchor of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients was first place, later on 500 seats were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people at the Salesians in Munich meet in the area of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West lies the football field of the TSV Munich Ost, east of residential buildings of the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in architectural style based on the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "Main Square" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was named" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were working and on 5 April 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn track."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens' Rights Committee published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and missourians, as a number of questionable, fast-based incidents in the entire country occur and be noted here," said the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to obtain discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state that disproportionately target minorities, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that people are going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Attorney Office, in which black drivers in the state will be halted 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">"people have to be ready, whether they bring to chew money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report program of the FBI, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states agreed to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Feminine Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Assembly Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-wing court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU city association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, as well as many kittens and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is for him the alternative-loose marketing pathway for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also chairman of the BLHV president of Fishery bach, he called the" "turnkey project" "as" "elementary important." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area care for a lot of work, much needed to be worked on with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it did not lead a bioeconomy."</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the significance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leadership."</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they carry on their operations," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares which must not be afforded by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of €71 500, half over leader was promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do a really good job without farmers and farm women.</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg offers state-of-the-art funding for pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area may not be sluggish (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 Fishery Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the coverage area is 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty"</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value them just like any other - therefore the admittedly staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for the drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have told him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he resorted to its importance, and in particular the meaning you attributed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base has been added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," I don't want to go into a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly correct, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants but the poorest of the poor:" your tired, your arms, / your oppressed masses, who long for breathing freely, and the miserable garbage of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable rubbish" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">"this conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America."</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big scream of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not invited, but rather an early neo-conservationist who brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a matter of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this, of course, is not the prospect of ever recognizing Miller and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not lighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power, ignites."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black shows Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two ballots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director's Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special is developed in Scotland" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to find it," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as team captain by the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was unbelievable," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medallions competing in their fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir leads on this road and last year set five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which one should observe after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about this team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was anyway a great honor, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scotsman who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out and compete there, and it just will be a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long before the newspapers struck him, from the domestic policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he pushed for criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in the year 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led as sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a reciprocal reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side is a public forum called official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governors's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or ammunition or hateful people, who swing the whip online."</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "she wrote in the commentary box of the message" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't like this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what designated the governor as" "concentrated spam" "attack would probably call others" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles, or to arrest and arrest demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck their lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Navigation with Great Britain, overwhelmed his position, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public raising advance in front of the occupying troops."</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesian ruinous provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua, including the Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and told journalists in Jakarta:" "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>

<seg id="375">"Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019, but the Papua people say they will not be right again for Jokowi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," "says Gobai, the leader of the tribal council."</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" guilt "he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk enjoys the huge number of prepositions for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">"in doing so, he has so far underestimated that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation."</seg>
<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever triumptuous figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-CEO Elon Musk for the first time announced another less brilliant figure: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="425">"now Musk is giving a dream: 63,000 had already been withdrawn from the 518,000 reservations."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"in case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds)" reservation payment "completely."</seg>
<seg id="428">"currently 455,000 of such non-binding reservations are available, spatite Musk in a telephone conference with analysts."</seg>

<seg id="430">"its argument: the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side."</seg>
<seg id="431">"in the past year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="432">"in 2018, all models are to be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million."</seg>

<seg id="434">"according to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently available per day."</seg>
<seg id="435">"who orders a" Model 3 "today must reckon with the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new, never in practice tested production lines without any major disruptions at maximum capacity."</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="443">"it is about a deadline, which ended on October 1, for states to meet the 2015 standards for ozone."</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt declared in June that he would delay the observance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid hindering on local decisions or hindering economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was prosecuted by President Donald Trump of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>

<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery site in Tumlings will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16th July at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and sponsors Tumlingens to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique rural gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 the St. Hilary chapel was first mentioned in documentary documentary: count Hermann von Sulz sold" the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen, together with the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"on the hill of Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the Church or the patron of the patron and not the other way around."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as follows from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was beside the village and the Oberdorf, which is still to be recognized today in the village of Tumlings, the" mountain "of the third, the noble settlers of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the time around the year 1600 underpin this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was taken from the early medieval hereditary law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"in doing so, it was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two barons at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be delivered in 1942 in the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were inserted and the bell pieces were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to crash in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Hilarius Cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower of the tower remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallen's and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant as successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as a promoter, the friends and supporter of Tumlingens are invited to the old cemetery to the St. HilariusChapel on Sunday, July 16th."</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "Boisheim forbids" "does not provide a legal basis for the construction and therefore has turned to the Councillor."</seg>
<seg id="506">The "Boisheim Club" association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the time in Viersen on the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration area causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the town."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are meant to prevent a "savings" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had agreed a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formator."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planned legal requirements, the granted permit is still illegal and therefore rejected," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again decided to hold the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" in this position, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned. "</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation.</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the cause of reviewing the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they are unlikely to cause the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to express itself to the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four 200 metres high wind turbines."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, which took part in the city of Viersen, closed Pachtcontracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered, which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">"last summer, Viersen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg."</seg>

<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community, that injustice has never been corrected."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But nobody was ever accused.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain on free foot for decades, citizens' rights say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>
<seg id="593">"in April 1946, a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for the preselection campaign in the summer."</seg>
<seg id="594">"approximately at the same time as the election stach according to the FBI, Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, sat down during a battle - allegedly because of a woman."</seg>
<seg id="595">Brooks said the rumour in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcoms's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="596">"on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, so the FBI."</seg>
<seg id="597">He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.</seg>
<seg id="598">"but when she came down from prison and came closer to Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob ringed the car."</seg>
<seg id="599">"as it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report. "</seg>
<seg id="600">"it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the killings, eliminated evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="601">Brooks formulated it even more concise.</seg>
<seg id="602">"it was an electoral campaign," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="606">"it's hard to watch, and it is difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point."</seg>
<seg id="607">"we do not want to talk about the Lynch, because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="608">But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've done.</seg>
<seg id="609">"the rehearsals for this year's production started in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened to a well-played overview of the piece."</seg>

<seg id="613">"but I think it is very important to keep this story alive, because we do not want to return to these times."</seg>
<seg id="614">"on the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona rehearsed Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, their lines."</seg>
<seg id="615">"the piece starts with Malcom, the Hester cries and drives him, furious that he slept with his wife Dorothy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said, n --- he vanished from my property!"</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona answers the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene laughs at the loudest.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," asked Rascona. "</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," said Greene, still giggling. "</seg>

<seg id="629">"everyone is busy getting this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people."</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene begins again.</seg>
<seg id="631">"this time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and with emphasis."</seg>
<seg id="632">Absolutely no one laughs.</seg>
<seg id="633">This repetition ends violent and fast.</seg>
<seg id="634">"there are cries, shots, and then silence."</seg>
<seg id="635">"a woman, dressed with a dream-dress, stands over the corpses of the actors and leads Billie Holidays in mourning praise" Strange Fruit. ""</seg>
<seg id="636">Your voice breaks with every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">"about a hundred metres behind it, a group of about four dozen people got sweat and tears out of their eyes."</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">"a couple is coming from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down just the street."</seg>
<seg id="640">"they have seen Georgias oppressive humidity for almost eight hours, when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Malcoms and Dorseys."</seg>
<seg id="641">"up to this point, the killings have remained an anecdote, but now when you stand in the same country where the Lynch Morde took place, the air feels spooky."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound, Greene loads the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children sit on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," mumbles a little boy as if he wanted to remember. "</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>
<seg id="646">The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe off their tears.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh the man in the suit that the clan member has played.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms; the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.</seg>
<seg id="649">"it's okay," "whispers one of the women."</seg>
<seg id="650">We know that this is not in your heart.</seg>
<seg id="651">You have done this for one reason. "</seg>
<seg id="652">Later the audience with the actors sit together for dinner.</seg>

<seg id="655">"it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="656">"what this really does with me makes me believe that Lynx still continues," she added, "today it is called police shooting."</seg>
<seg id="657">"in the same room, Tyrone's court holds Brooks's farm at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights."</seg>
<seg id="658">He said he already started planning the performance next year.</seg>
<seg id="659">"the reproduction is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="864">In the Ore Mountains the three-chain is to be further optimized.</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a fool, after a stumbling block, did not want to capture the Fortunen any more."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in the preparation with the three-chain-chain better than with the four-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"yet I don't know how to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is his case, "because we are in the three chain at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, who can build well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we do even better harmonize and do not afford so many abnormalities in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can talk about a misfucking start, you don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could well be okay," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a good season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I only judge the start into the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over the eyes of Aue, because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know so 100% where they are currently standing," "says the inner defender of Fortuna."</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, guests from the Rhineland act as a lighter favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep it away, just because we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive for only a defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which one has to beat from the start," explains Fortunas's chief coach. "</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (RättsMediinalverket) started the tests last year.</seg>

<seg id="887">"until today, migration can be sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may" be under 18 years of age. ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"we don't see any big difference in statistics of past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said to the magazine The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that" "suggest that the aged person was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"as the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results published in 581, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">To evaluate the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars World Record transfer from Spain to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will be made for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, means that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer from Neymar was financed without any major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make money loose for Neymar to sign up and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the rich royal family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"associations may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be counteracted by legitimate income sources that allow them to take the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who in their quest for success had taken enormous debts, effectively cheered and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to the surveillance of their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich, originally used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder task."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP trial period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015 by the Presidency, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat-rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the redemption sum can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP-sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at the time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season Champions League were limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to persuade their financial supervision by blowing up their income through companies that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a catarian company sponsors PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will be ambassadors and can easily find such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to every attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer, on Thursday told the people who were familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of €542.4 million achieved a profit of more than €10 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, merchandising and jersey sales."</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">"the Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP."</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last owner to PSG. "</seg>
<seg id="1154">"arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport-tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club."</seg>
<seg id="1155">"it is the consequence of the ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the past 15 years," "said Wenger on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country has a club, everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="1157">"it is very difficult to respect the financial Fairplay, because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."</seg>

<seg id="1159">"over the past few years, Chocolat Frey has made Frey board chocolates for the Swiss."</seg>

<seg id="1168">"but more importantly, the advertising impact is always more important: it is a prestigious order for a shooter manufacturer."</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to betray the number of applicants for the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to pursue a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment."</seg>
<seg id="1173">"since 2006, Swiss chocolate tablets have been distributed on board their flights."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is at the same time nostalgically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's years, for the 90 years Grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter walked the Sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a promising jar of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin)."</seg>

<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippines of" Singles, "whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"it is the moments of accidental madness that could invoke this franchise like a repetitive" Seven Up!

<seg id="1219">A total of over 300 policemen were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the mafia's members are accused of organised drug criminality, violent acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office established Konstanz against the organized drug trade in southern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1222">"between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Crime Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily."</seg>

<seg id="1231">"according to the Register, ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship, including 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data was not sufficiently well maintained, data quality in parts has not been good."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"data from 1921 was found in individual cases," "of people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the Register."</seg>

<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children if they entered."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when they kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in their quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that inflation would likely increase to just under 3% in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But it signalized that interest increases would be necessary in the coming years to get the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut's business package, which was published a year after Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC, the GDP (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it repeated that" "a certain tightening of monetary policy" "would be required for cooling inflation and a" "slightly greater" "extent than markets await."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that increases would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The downwards corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year will be 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound after these messages fell opposite the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest rate increase, and GDP has risen to 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is easy to recover after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report offers little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal salary increases, as the tightening first becomes worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot" "prevent" "income from the coming years," "but she added that wages will be" "clear" "at the end of their three-year forecast."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for a part of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the lowering of the pounds."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably last for four years until this will reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the last ruling of the Bank on interest rates, the call for an interest rate rose since inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers demanding a rise to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said this was expected and will be tightened again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the excess in relation to its goal of 2% is "quite" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Managing Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers said:" in view of the recent swap rate, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders want to search for businesses and end the year in a positive way. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks especially good for those in which the existing deals expire and the new mortgages complete, and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service to a first three-year study for 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chute announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England's chief Simon Stevens as" important new intervention, "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to include the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in case of infection at risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means to take that just enough medications are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants are identified that agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is awarded £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competition.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is used in a large scale, taken up and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, when it is targeted on needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with a high HIV-risk approach will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We sincerely welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "priority must now be that the study will be conducted quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV-prevention and can end the transfer of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society a step closer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced itself to a Earls Court Apartment in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely refurbished."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over one another, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, in order to solve the announcement."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, there are mirrored units for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important so that when you push the door up, it is very easy gliding."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage room, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated," "says Erfan."</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city area, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburb."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as" "main operator and the dominating personality" "in the De Lutis family - described about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns the value of $316 million and Paul has worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul off to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says, he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk-bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, opened in Colin's first case."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began west co there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to disclose her property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that marks were paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were, thus Paul says," embittered on the conditions of its financial separation. ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin kept himself very back even though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can really not say much" because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw up our surname by the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight," he said, and added that he was still hoping for a solution. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">The Trump of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff at his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House which he wanted to repair: poor information that comes into the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions when he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship to television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was angry due to unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of places that were to be persuaded," "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keeping the Trump Twitter habits under control, according to six former election campaigns, is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more ignition material without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his co-workers have managed to keep his anger away from him, their efforts were worth it."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has consistently prevented it, that Trump controversies out."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors, to the president for strategic reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with leaks leaks, and that he can find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone voluntarily accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief clerk Katie Walsh," "to be the source behind a bunch of leaks" "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicans, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, attempted to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counsellors still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1432">"angry residents have pushed the advice of Solihull, who said it" "useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said: "they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by.</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it, as he was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">"the house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1st, next year."</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof through its former Ambiente company mbH on the 13th of April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year, as well as income from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees entering the district, the hotel building was offered as a gathering accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented asylum seekers from establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed at that time."</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with CEO Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a House of the Three-Star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building construction waste containers before the entrance, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer talking to our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should become" "nice bourgeois" "later on, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"the swimming pool, the wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"you don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high-level downtown-level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to grow wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"both individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's performances are similar to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he expects."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external units are also brought to the front, which is clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which is accessible to the public by the restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Agency puts a jury on the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in the past few weeks, the Panel has recorded the work, wrote the" "Wall Street Journal" "on appeal to people entrusted with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper was taking the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the broadcaster CNN reported that there are already initial proposals of the Gremium, in connection with a meeting between the shrimps of the eldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been blaming the Kremlin for more specifically in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the republics in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more Trump's private and commercial environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Representative Trump had personally moved into the centre and foretold whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also referred to as charges."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Council may also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN broadcaster, there were already demonstrations that revolved around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting were asked to be a statement in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr. Trumps were also advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his dam leader Paul Manafort during the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the introduction shows that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, it would be quick to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up being turned on to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the implementation of the Gremium at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President, on Thursday evening, used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the Democrats a chance to "feel good" because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work, however, usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House administers any action that hastened the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI director James Comey had said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was explained in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been used after being fired after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rationale, accusations against Trump were loud, he wanted to impede the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey, in June, said before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and his staff."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent spokesman of the Congress, like in the Watergate affair around the former president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on adversaries of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators set out on Thursday, on Thursday, after which the special promoter could no longer be released so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">That shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the large-scale and 5800-square-kilometer large colossus now drive northwards and probably would need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice colds that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"according to research information, to what extent climate change has played a role in the decline of the iceberg."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for some 30 years, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colt was part of the Larsen-C-Shelter so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">"as a result, it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Shelter is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"north of this shelf, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete scarf is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a good talk that also the Larsen-C-Shelter is in danger, because the front edge has never pulled as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of shellfish and iceberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice the ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could increase the sea level, albeit only to a small degree, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelesss is the fourth biggest shelling of Antarctica after AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change, the iceplate is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists is contested whether the Larsen C shelf will grow back or go back in the long run and possibly gather together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not return this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many ice-creams of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature rise has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has heated by around three degrees over the past 50 years, and therefore counts among the areas where the temperature is fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to be Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls forth from the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, 41 new places in the administration got stuck in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have had their first working day behind them."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The courses in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were to be recorded for this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle lacks staff to cope with the increasing demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently no occupied areas in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, physicians and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">"the CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, would like to take the initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, point out concrete measures for cross-climbers and include an education offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one previously didn't know.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is by a regular "competition of the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who excrete disease or age from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"high time to act, so that no more places remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Koch, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long since made a fist surprise in the day of the day for a lazy surprise, when he publicly questioned the personal cost coverage and the other parties were astounded."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed that allow an exit from the local employer association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a Haustarif," "says people."</seg>

<seg id="1575">"the salaries are exactly prescribed, elevations or more money are only available if one changes to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be established, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act."</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the sound of NGO migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the turiner daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their squad effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself too detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "said the organization in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only judge any accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that its crew will ship dinghy migrants, delivered directly from traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as Iuvventa must have an Italian police officer on board, who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code, Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize laureate organisation is Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy have declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and the cooperation with local citizens have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfalls of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there followed observation points, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded."</seg>

<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, has become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges."</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first Bundesligavereine which are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning was 2015 VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 signed."</seg>

<seg id="1629">"and for the Asian Games 2022, e-sports is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobous has long been confronted with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and take care of the diet.</seg>
<seg id="1636">The fading player is a good player.</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, frobers also have problems:" doping becomes more and more a topic. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"checks are difficult for online gaming, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are internationally on the way, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to lie at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"this is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, though."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte advisors. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the move.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the football-first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," "explains VfB Management Board Röttgermann."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were subjected to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June due to negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and facing down eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "she has not shown any remorse." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters lawyer said it was a" "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that their" age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions. "</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I do not occupy the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, in spite of all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity, to be there for his sisters," "he says."</seg>

<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that they encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," "she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "All you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was tried by Roy's death and ordered that they should profit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"the few who defended Carter belonged to Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder at her British co-inhabitant in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1800">"there is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf-cad, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>

<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings are enough."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from violence, and while all over the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a public prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we are blaming everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he just managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelve river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-level mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, February saw the release of an interview with Damez Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, the aisle members suspected of buying any copy of the issue, as soon as they were extradited to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country on its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US-Dollar shareholdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting tests without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" "for its coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you have as a journalist - either that or you're playing the fool.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was like a port worker, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now ask them," "Was his love for the routine be his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space in which the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who called the Governor himself untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has kept on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the government spending concentrated on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was abducted or how it was done, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-class corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, among them one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, readers viewed the Valdez column as the best informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was devoted to the storage space for signs and stickers to protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they have never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become loudly phased by written" SOS Press "in organised protests and constructions."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of picking up journalists and letting them move because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she be redivided by the government, because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "surrounded" "by organised crime, government officials and a" "equitable society". ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that are hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the" Articulo 19 "media group has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones lay next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as it did El Manana by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the cartels with an editorial on the title page" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admitted that the drug trade was frightened by him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer, when all their telephones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with belt rivets and security forces near the Mazatlan's seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated as promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the mighty portrait of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps."</seg>

<seg id="1923">"at first sight, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhino of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts have described it as a "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even find that its flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the captured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs of the world. ""</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers, who describe it as" really remarkable, ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something about the surrounding rock out of the square, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"the fossil, discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology."</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the £2500 pound (1.100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you smile only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has been sleeping," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have discovered that this plant-eater, even though it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing shell, probably is threatened by meat eaters dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a screening technique known as counter-protection, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shaded shade, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shaded is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs were hunted by eating enough dinosaurs by meat eating dinosaurs that the evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurus carnivores have been the cycle time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including his preserved darminate to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South-Floorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just shoot a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when giant Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was buried in the sea after death and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the wooded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were approximately 18 feet long (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the credentials of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin-stallions still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a win in Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remnants of the skin still cover the hollowed armored plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot rests on his side, his five fingers crossed to the top."</seg>

<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works so: you enter the train, call his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post of someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18 year old child, and it is still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live to tweets."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's active body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people shouting, and by a man who claimed to be a Browns father who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman said his gun and cried," "I'm going to kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt chills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation, which they had" "over the black experience and the black state" "many times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for it, what they believe in?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to be free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is not different from the next black woman child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel that I would show you a bad service, to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They before and helped them to pass on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came into the mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often white-in a community who benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview," "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todekikt occupants."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we're talking," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, for so I am going to be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" "Whose Streets" "reveal surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have shaped the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really kept by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" "this is not an affirmative type of action," "at Ferrell's identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the front of the front because with a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racist ties between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although they are not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct splits the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "the topic is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" "that would be a dream" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "no man needs" "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" "megalomania!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleed out."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added to this: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farm hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, there will be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Galerie-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - at Beda-Platz, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying almost every week in the farmers market hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women gladly again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There is also this in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall settles in the gallery arrives at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what to do in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of that in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"one sees however, how many shops are empty here - some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, as the rents there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special deals do not exist any more and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't suit me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the farmers market hall should go there during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the specter bit gallery already manage to drive all stores out of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no longer place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market is ruined, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous, hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst served a 35 year prison sentence after she made public diplomats published secretly on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years" correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly convicted of identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison so much that there was only one photo - a granny, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project" Strangers Visions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette blacks and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they had an interview with Chelsea Manning while being in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't visit her and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal British customers who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo's" Suppressed Images, "which foresaw a future in which the President would convert Russia's judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning released Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweetable paths in order to inflame the rigid divisions, which he really should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things as Dewey-Hagborg, she said that" things happen for a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning led with her excessive signature (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to" "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome is not responsible for who we are and how openly they are genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the Comic-Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows maning how she appears with a hands-free phone in his hand from the disciplinary brains of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they leave your words cold, then they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "well, never hold your mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greetings from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning did not see the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacons, which gather like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University because of killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A national hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who will be looked after as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead for dead, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem would now be in a review and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage. "</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigators in every conceivable way.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he would strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate it," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said. "</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents:" "the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the Russian prime minister Vitaly Mutko said, it won't be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA)."</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-setting RUSADA and has recently been published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that may cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the publicly sponsored doping in Russian sports by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutkos's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov made problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"nobody has to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added. "</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia as part of the doping scandal."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti-doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to be lucky with your staff at your e-commerce startup, but the polls did not work."</seg>

<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to offer surveys, special groups and demographic groups to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure commitment. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel during the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the Snap polls and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low authorisation results - so you can drill down why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they must remain at the forefront of the workplace culture so that you do not have to become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"for start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity."</seg>

<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"and if the chief executive is involved, complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent. "</seg>

<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now that Convercent is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair placements - were identified and addressed faster."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday."</seg>

<seg id="2231">"companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employee Engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online.</seg>

<seg id="2234">"both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products."</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing total funding to $60 million."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat at the River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England takes the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac handleiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to a letter of thumb on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "he says."</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so struck with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") all this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscaping, gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected? "</seg>

<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', represented by the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be quite crook, getting debts and spending money on things they could not afford. "</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan sent a further 7395 state aid to Erdogan, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to grieve earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his victory in 2002, Erdogan suppressed the power of the military step by step, not least on appeal to the European Union reforms."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not become more crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots comes."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "customize" "his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "who would have a stepford woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, if one goes a step towards Frigid (here is: reluctant) Farrah, disturb most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy was compared with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a withdrawal from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what seeps through the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who boasted women to have sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the devout bodies and the poked eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjugation."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship, with whom she fought for decades, suddenly and quite strange on the same page."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but I am in a further context that this also entails significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the stellar effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>

<seg id="2542">"thus, under consideration of the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a redevelopment."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may result."</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at tryptophan rich diet promotes less inflammatory bowmilieus, if the same system also entertains with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but that had not been accommodated, did not have this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial strains of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually living in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice failed."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were put up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were given to L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been cleaned from the fluid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2671">Funding for local core III</seg>
<seg id="2672">"who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years, can soon get support from the country."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"over this, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development informed on Wednesday."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"at the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back to what is happening."</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been in sensitivities.</seg>
<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, previous restructurings are a" "successful project" "- it is finally important to promote the development of the interior and not only open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the government presidium of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a remediation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount will amount to 833 333 euros, including 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the community."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a rehabilitation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will, so Schindler continue to investigate where the" really old "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the area limits may then also be postponed again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the jetty was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the Federal Government program" "Social Town", "in which the refurbishment would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, improving the living conditions and working conditions, and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would then eventually be set as statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The period of approval for the funding has been in operation since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the stock intake would only be carried out in the framework of those involved in the refurbishment area to fill out a questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the statute of sentences is to be carried out in order to begin with the renovations in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann explained that each municipality would have to carry out the preliminary investigations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"it is a question of assessing and deciding when, when it is being renovated and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective property, a remediation note is also registered in the land register."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will come to mind again and take a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore questionnaires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the Yellow Questionnaire is the" "Building and Property Sector", "which includes, among other things, the structural condition and the refurbishment views."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the gray questionnaire, the" "household and apartment", "data on size, distribution and residents can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "operating arch" is only to be filled out if there are commercial premises in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, please note, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire does not at the same time apply for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not eligible."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler insisted that the distribution of the funding according to the" "greyhound principle" "was working - whoever comes first, first adresses."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"one cannot afford to" "reserve" "funds for later."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month, costs taxpayers according to the military information left to TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products of all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a Mississippi forklift."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 3 o'clock in the morning, and until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we posed was whether it was a breach of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you're locked," "the deputy commander replied."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">President is obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to demand their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential airplane was stationed in front of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential airplane."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to deal with the US president in the White House with precise centimeter sets.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as Trump at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Recording of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement sets is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former White House press spokesperson, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter's commitment to the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week that are made in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"it is, of course, appropriate to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of fire brigade."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump said to representatives of Sikorsky and was joking with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the driver of the coming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident."</seg>
<seg id="2886">According to the accident offenders it can be good that the mercedesdriver had not noticed the accident at all.</seg>
<seg id="2887">The police now asks witnesses to the incident and the driver of the polluter to contact tel. 05761 / 92060 with the Commissariat in Stolzenau.</seg>
<seg id="2888">"interview:" "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother George Ratzinger" ""</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse falls relieved by Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are a church, "announced after publication of the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much, if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the events."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican magazine" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised the fact that there was" two measure "in reporting on violence."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the violations in Regensburg, no one has to deal with" shameful and shameful acts, "which must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, too, said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" one likes to go to the church and this is a found fresher. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows had been a very normal pedagogical remedy," "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they are unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on abuse, often Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memory of" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 domesticks sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said:" "in summary, it can be said that R. Domkapellmeister R. has in many cases been applied to forms of physical and psychological violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with great emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, many victims were estimated to be the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories join with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieved its opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violent exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen "has a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many disciples raise their" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became tangible when a cathedral atz did not bring any top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is generally found therein."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he is dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or mistress in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"the excesses of violence at the preschool, too, took place outside of its sphere of influence."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to ask him at best, to experience it too late, or to have taken first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium gymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all the respondents as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony, described him as" warm hearted, "" sincere, "" honest, "" honest, "" honest, "" competent "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and" always surrounded the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which led to wakefulness."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the key and the key on the floor, but also gave ear-cowards and too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he has already been given years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually is in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the external acts of violence at the preschool, they are bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders, if it is not more familiar with his fame and role as Benedict XVI's brother, that many media have just crashed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many people who have never understood him are still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report very much was reported about abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also be responsible for any involvement or involvement with sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "said a person to the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral conductor, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a quieted disciple put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that thought out to him... Buben intrusive or clearer or even more likely to have opened than towards their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "that the students and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any co-operation."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as it unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was much of" "excesses of violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former master-master, Georg Ratzinger, is accused of being accused of being" "throwing away". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything mixed and mixed up was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedrals, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let's say, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. four decades ago, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the domesticated cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were brutally harassed and painted, and suffered from it, all of them arose at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there have been really scandalous states."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had only to face the boys when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the subject" preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnastics gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the accusation remains to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger confuse his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points to it," that in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already given the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as a criminal record had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">What do you think?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about anachronism" fall-stride, "that is to say, the danger of past today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and also not for what has been broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's prawns, which goes far beyond the practice at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very terrible and I am glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. to draw earths and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburg time has George Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic of testing also be applied to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's all about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, that the domes played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not conceal that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonbons alone, the rebellious boys are now no big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did Georg Ratzinger experience in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: because of the work on the book and beyond that I have experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, deep-gracious, deep-believing and heartfelt people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could only do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former domes, 23 years after his emeritition, visit him, read it - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not yet forgiven him until today are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most of the dominions are grateful to him today, that he has enriched her life and brought to them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always has a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look up and worship them today."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once more clearly: all you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the resistor would command a 93-year old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
