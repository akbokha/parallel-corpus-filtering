J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from the outside label , who mostly have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather snow@@ ing . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress would like to spend their time at home , with a television with fla@@ wed de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to whit@@ ew@@ ash , she raises the question of a child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home to feed the food in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career ended up again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was at all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he left with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even ho@@ ist for photo purposes . &quot;
it was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite impressive .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyramid .
there is no lack of hon@@ esty to the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave 25,000 euros the prize money . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the tor@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Reu@@ ters Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports enthusiasts came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the Money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - that is what Clinton and Tru@@ mp want to do .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are at the helm of taxation and energy policy , as well as a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
of the role of the state .
&quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep that in doubt rather small , and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely decline regul@@ ators , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would increase , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the first place , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost word @-@ to @-@ word . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be party @-@ internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the US .
&quot; oil promotion should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand the renewable energies with its investment program and demands : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , is standing on one side to boost growth . &quot;
his critics stop him so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least by the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being observed .
she sm@@ iled briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ bred women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - not even as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as the hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many are secretly standing out of it because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; the fact that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that as soon as they anchor in Germany , tell B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single @-@ standing women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this results in about 90 percent of the women who live in the north of Munich , traumati@@ zed , appreciate them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not develop voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to having nothing to say .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodation is needed only for them , B@@ ahr calls . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question , if they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing as governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians , women alone are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some community shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; as the women feel this need of protection , you can read the crowds on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since speaking about that we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work campaigns
the assistant doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
J@@ DC said that there would have been a ministry to address concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students agreed to reject a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members that was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; would have remained , which led to the rejection of the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations with all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaigns that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute led to the fact that , in the history of N@@ HS , Assi@@ sts fought six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the director of the BM@@ A assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t for@@ bid the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile worked nar@@ row@@ ly and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; loving friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if nothing had happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s g@@ lowing , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
&quot; going out was even bigger , as it was done by a supposed friend . &quot;
to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
&quot; most serious accus@@ ations from senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has fought this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting was only held because Putin received the excuse of President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clear . &quot;
&quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan requires all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of almost his office during the last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are economic motives too .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West since it responds to its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state security won a bonus for asking for the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course that itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit of this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; to Russia and Turkey : two countries which have been viol@@ ently and badly treated by the West and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ ved the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey mi@@ tig@@ ated it deliberately to answer a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey sha@@ kes the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk again at least . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Management , the R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds sponsored by six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by , to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized headquarters and the stock exchange rate are changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor brand as well as the brand among which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot;
each of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers in these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that his Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ t champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings 3,000 profits to it . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he put a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won at G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ers when he brings victory to Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone which only few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans for years for this kind of sport . &quot;
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6.000 wins if he was not just a weekend and Grand Prix jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of winners in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to its best form . &quot;
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s discharge from his duties as chairman of the Russian president &apos;s administration without giving any reason . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was a deputy since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the Director of Directors and Chief of Staff of the Gover@@ nor . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state for bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow a secret place .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed to great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compla@@ ining posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin arrived to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin would violate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday prior to the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details of how the character Gib@@ son follows from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , will be released at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;

ri@@ dd@@ les about fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a citizen of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could act with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were sp@@ elled out by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the project will be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; Deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the project will be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown today paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total de@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete offer in Ros@@ y@@ th today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone at each bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and low construction .
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the landing page . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; delicate , since the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were operating only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station beat on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved on from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a Bo@@ je hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have lost happiness and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but the boat was loos@@ ing the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has guarded these men today .
seriously injured - a man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead the alcoholic offen@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
&quot; this , then , al@@ armed his sister . &quot;
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
&quot; on the street , they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old slept with his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Green Party mean that investors should be taken into duty much more strongly in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 affordable apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; concept of action &quot; for the next council meeting .
but arguments are programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a rule is missing so far .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the grand dispute in the town hall was , however , that Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing funding program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er jobs for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , so Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program is not entirely entirely : because the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of more around 1300 affordable apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of returning apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; because in the west town , Fri@@ sten runs for the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; since the number of social housing in the west @-@ city is increased dramatically again , one removes itself from the target of the so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go with the boat . &quot;
this has focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their leisure time in star@@ ing on screens , has been depl@@ eted by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon tracking with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that reflect the &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; person each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , announced that within two days after the game launch , the number of consecutive people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to take 30 minutes to &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; get active &quot; &quot; every day , because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the Wonder@@ ful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even hunt new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ ir@@ rels that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could go against a door . &quot;
what is it to do ?
there has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit had previously been able to track our activity , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be followed up with the time .
&quot; due to poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , helping many people in hunting , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast added on Thursday to a multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating bar during the single multi @-@ campaign woman at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi @-@ battle title , winning the fifth while holding her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she burst out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the past three years , 15 world champi@@ onships - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing practices that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the farewell party , she served the reti@@ ring team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long way to the top , never planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic stadium in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Mu@@ staf@@ a led by two turns , the picture dec@@ eased . &quot;
floating beams and soil ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title title .
&quot; with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the beams again , she again picked up on the beams - and put another on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her en@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the power Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Mu@@ staf@@ ina went . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man captain , called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their clou@@ d@@ iness , she threw the audience into kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims killed in mass murder when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ers of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in an entry , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over@@ sight , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks during four months and two more injured were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and were committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sho@@ ot@@ ings that crashed on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the tri@@ pled murder and from which it was assumed that it was the factory of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his aging , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I could not do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund might never be able to recognize them and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I did not know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can work with the help of a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we teach him the sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know it .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect them to really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the national weather service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesperson for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags were multiplied . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the assembly of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone would have demanded ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
&quot; the weather service allowed , that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches might fall to rain . &quot;
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday , while mobile continues to rain in the area of mobile . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a stream @-@ downstream in@@ undation in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , already reached the highest level on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still don@@ ate people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step @-@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and poured out the water , pouring in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; spread quickly &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions .
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer mel@@ ted near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground by the rainf@@ alls has been fully lied to since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ator in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches that were both flooded .
&quot; the ruler of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags provided for the residents , who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as flooded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for more than 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; carved by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police inform that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital with his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pun@@ ched by balls , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ore Mel@@ ende@@ z told the station . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in the stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical condition , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault rif@@ les , traced back to various assault rif@@ les , se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were sleeves . &quot;
&quot; so it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; shared police detachment Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia with the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently checking the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a squ@@ ad@@ ron on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police is still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that from more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they did not expect but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie fought all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to bring it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . also , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts up primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ as@@ tics and families ) . the list can be continued as required . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the communities au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics exercise . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics foundation of 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable Harlem in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds motiv@@ ate to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organize other strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 doctors who voted in a vote , rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that N@@ HS was in a &quot; no @-@ country &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend deadlines , in order to improve the care at un@@ favourable times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ sts appointed last night in a message with : &quot; &quot; assisting doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , especially that it will heat the current mat@@ ernity @-@ crisis and make it to treat all physicians appropriately . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; the BM@@ A &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes through discussions met with the government on reluct@@ ance , and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence . &quot;
&quot; this was done by a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the condition and address the worries of the doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he should not do so , the doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to cover doctors on the strike chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to have a better week @-@ end compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians who will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , urged the doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labour action measures do not achieve the only little , but already strain over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and positively responded to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training - were a sign of how seriously it was employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day drug after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the coag@@ ulating agent Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority recommended an intake of 4 years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE Regul@@ atory Authority recommended an intake of 4 years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form the floor@@ ings .
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ICE approach , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves election fraud in Muslim areas
&quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur was removed from office due to corruption . &quot;
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today .
&quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former member of the Cab@@ inet , interven@@ es verb@@ ally ignor@@ ing the police , elec@@ tive observers and town halls , ignor@@ ing evidence of elec@@ tive abuse on the basis of &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters take a card to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
&quot; whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also the government government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose .
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation by which a person sel@@ ects as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter election - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of ID cards to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ ist@@ ani background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 Recommen@@ dations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are working on postal voting to stop &quot; &quot; re@@ aping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which will be considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your identity card .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists process full postal elections and envel@@ opes from postal elections .
the police give the authority to set up barriers to set up electoral stations .
a change of legislation which facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( National Agency Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters alone go to the elec@@ tive cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no complaint .
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Court l@@ ent Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ ups &quot; of the election registr@@ ations of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud inheritance as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy according to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio will be out of the French cycling enthusi@@ ast Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T beside the edge and band that proved to be an impressive double @-@ headed du@@ ke of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to have gold fighting ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you can give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; to commemor@@ ate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic champi@@ ons that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio compared &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people in the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi &apos;s Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures , on which he looks terri@@ bly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I think it &apos;s probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African Schwi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; a further comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair such as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the similarities .
theory in space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the American football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as he called , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;

&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; was dead like a pig ? &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free @-@ style s@@ wimm@@ ers for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard where many people asked him to speak
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let all of us look like ra@@ cists .
&quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end over 90 times with people responding to the B@@ emer@@ kt over Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC rep@@ lic@@ ated and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night with our spectators on show and our followers in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of float in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald exc@@ laimed in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who tried sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman moved her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ que to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she pat@@ tern@@ ed her , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ garments , &quot; she went back and left the business , without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried it . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not like , as they put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything , moved back and out . &quot;
she did not seem to distur@@ b anyone to observe - or think about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants she had tried .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; How absurd to think that someone would take home under@@ pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and left her and she was not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ ber around the sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knee into the gro@@ in and turn , while the aggres@@ sor gri@@ ps with pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backwards while she strai@@ gh@@ tens the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , grab the weapon and twist it , so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ tening the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y the saf@@ est is to over@@ reach your money , if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ mined his immune system and worm ef@@ lex of a serious test - adding some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and ek@@ el@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k put his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the empt@@ ying of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he will get into . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pulling toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; luckily , nothing was left over , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to railway stations to dish@@ washers of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he met his reputation in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample coating showed a lumin@@ ometric number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick off after their L@@ umin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says , &quot; &quot; That comes close to the worst I have in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not do anything here because it is inside disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming which ended we said &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products only , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing , added : &quot; let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film .
in a survey conducted by 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing the attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung &apos;s social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative possessed the property in an irre@@ parable condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were perfor@@ ated holes on , wooden plan@@ ks were pulled up , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who had meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror inflic@@ ted by the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ alls , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive cries , strings and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was given an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished , old tr@@ ash was found &quot;
&quot; in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn open . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the streets and had to be inv@@ oked regularly by the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing deleg@@ ated her and her partners forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; one of them said , &quot; They cried for no one . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the town@@ house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously dealt with us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung on the ground
workers of the house administration will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don received a fine , after she had found herself guilty of holding a drug of class B in commercial intent . &quot;
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in 2013 during a car accident .
&quot; after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house walls were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will deleg@@ ate tenants who do not adhere to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police informed that del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal put in panic after a ti@@ ph@@ oned military jet beach over@@ flies
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces placed an incredible storm
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was fores@@ een . &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists started to panic after a ti@@ cking jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up as they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew twice really deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me .
&quot; tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep . &quot;
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ craft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so far had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to poor visibility , the jet flew a bit deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; these summ@@ ers destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke , which limits his view &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries against Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - The FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step to win the first title win in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the dou@@ ble@@ winner has to ren@@ ounce the under@@ worn Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europe League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who rides the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie also lacks Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter . &quot;
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training with which the question of the question at Bar@@ ca at least was clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
&quot; in this regard , Coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from a clear decision so far and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applicants . &quot;
&quot; before the first compulsory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test match of Liverpool , 0 : 4 . &quot;
&quot; even at 3 : 2 at Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince them . &quot;
Sev@@ ille again took the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
&quot; with so far eleven achievements , Barcelona is the record winner of this job . &quot;
Ma Long in a dedicated League for Table Tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; thus the world champion first took the Golden Grand S@@ lam with achievements in World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournam@@ ent and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it into the final game as expected and made the title one among themselves .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic prize was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they had withdrawn to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their cont@@ actors in fair competition on their own .
&quot; I played the matches up to this point for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts were awarded with the China flag . &quot;
the match was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he set the tempo at the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were nevertheless enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the German European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Bel@@ ly bred a rib@@ bed injury in his quarter @-@ final against the German European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits ″ massive problems ″ in the campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which usually the multi @-@ track mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in their own republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked him for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; blame is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sm@@ iles . &quot;
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his cur@@ ri@@ ers were at the same time by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC broad@@ caster , Tru@@ mp answered the question how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything other than &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party of Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to cut funds to support its election campaign , it should not be able to present better survey data . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to reach the Congress more closely in the arms of Congress . &quot;
Olympia : three @-@ ster fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to establish a disciplinary committee .
&quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes face distress after the second dop@@ ing affair . &quot;
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee as@@ cer@@ tained immediately to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former spr@@ inters and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village have given a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er . &quot;
this was reported by the team leadership of Kenya on the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to impose its own investigations and shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; depending on the results of the examination and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will take a review , &quot; &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and took off as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er , handed down and signed the sample , &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ yan &apos;s chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation , Michael Rot@@ ich , was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed athletes of his country against upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was allegedly arrested on his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing @-@ off@@ enses at the IO@@ C for a long time .
&quot; in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing checks before the Rio Games , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Games have been noted earlier that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted . &quot;
&quot; in front of the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya adopted the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is conform with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches were repeatedly raised that in Kenya can easily be accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had employed in the Russian field of athle@@ tics . &quot;
thereby it could be proven that in this kind of sport area @-@ covering and systematically ged@@ opt was .
&quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes have been excluded from the summer games . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temples of classical music and met with the role of Mary a youth dream . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary is playing and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous human being .
and Bart@@ oli res@@ ig@@ ns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley &apos;s &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ zzles went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as they did at the time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls left London last year to join the IS , reports according to reports in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a couple of weeks ago , her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had left the war @-@ torn country and returned to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school lea@@ vers from the east of London went into a plane heading towards Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton would stay in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land as a candidate for the Supreme Court
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge by the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect Gar@@ land to &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the highest judge for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said the Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;

I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the view that the Calendar also does . &quot;
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical neck , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for publication of the cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; those who do not adhere to and praise Erdo@@ gan sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons on short @-@ term , with tens of thousands of protection @-@ seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; believe the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the attempted coup attempt , the German Community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with some hundred thousand protection @-@ seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because the government had already crossed winding strongh@@ olds with sanctions months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the mixed put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees in their own country produces refugees , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the association compla@@ ined about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; to this end , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or sold in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who also is a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the director of the Association called for the German government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; is taking place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len practitioner destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics for the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not adhere to and praise Erdo@@ gan sit on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks established the largest group of asylum seekers recognised in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all eligible asylum seekers have been recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find themselves remun@@ er@@ ated before war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively politically , i.e. , by the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;

strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stupid than so far it &apos;s not going to be : summer holidays , heat and a day @-@ to @-@ day @-@ action combat - that bites . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , practical problems come : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , air ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers out fl@@ yers , and end up counting voices to apply only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania once again has to pass an election campaign to the people . &quot;
the hot phase when you can say that has just begun .
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting will be how strongly newcom@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tive dust .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the countryside , spreads roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just like his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sea @-@ ering has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame on the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create that &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the nice ministry now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes the right place at the wrong time at the right place . &quot;
she invited Merkel twice chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s election of the Bundestag is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U has largely avoided the usual electoral campaign bo@@ oths on market@@ places and m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the Union has noticed that in the country you have to crum@@ ble the base , that it needs to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you can hardly find it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ se of the country there is hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral comb@@ at@@ ants Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village @-@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were la@@ stly behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of Af@@ D ( 19 ) in surveys . &quot;
&quot; in the 2011 election , the SPD still won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to create the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of their holidays and mainly transfer their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; the President Claudia Müller calls it . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Green Party fighters embar@@ k on a search for local vocal ch@@ ests among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
their impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the works , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and finish only at about 20 a.m. , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the event will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the setting up of lodging options . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ dingen back on both sides of the B 27 .
escap@@ ing through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief executive director Florian King for the transport @-@ related management of the rehabilitation project . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach &apos;s street , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many ble@@ aches were looking and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks resi@@ ded in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not adher@@ ed to , the congregation called on the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; says King who , himself , made himself informed about the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have been s@@ las@@ h@@ ed .
the fastest way was with 77 km @-@ kilometres at the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become cal@@ mer . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment in them led to revenue qu@@ arri@@ es , each one asks to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; slight decline &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , but also ad@@ mits that , of course , the scroll is missing . &quot;
&quot; most strongly , the bars are along the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; , &quot; the sales revenue figures &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road renovation has thrown its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous was handled .
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complex traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also nice somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the effects of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its many years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terror , it is constantly being screw@@ ed on by laws . &quot;
&quot; after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ene .
&quot; all his proposals were politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Interior Minister in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; others , further points , would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I take part in this . &quot;
&quot; as Minister of the Interior , however , he was in results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gave a little time to pass before it presents its conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
but these are now all the more extensive .
&quot; some things are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons rights .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second trial for proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers it reasonable and does not require any chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
&quot; a few new ideas , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presented . &quot;
some of them are in themselves : he plans rapid proc@@ essions for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; with toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to pose some even worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of it is politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
&quot; some of them are still un@@ published , leaving questions open . &quot;
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it can &apos;t be said that the attack@@ ers of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with , were not cl@@ inging to election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner security has moved immen@@ sely into the focus .
&quot; first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral struggles . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in their position on the subject of internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , it went up between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; first of all , a gar@@ rison dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some of the Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a ren@@ unciation of double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a departure from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
we conclude the discussion in Germany .
you do not make sense .
&quot; and with a ban on burn , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tive at all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , you have to show yourself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause a quar@@ rel .
&quot; however , the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel recently sign@@ aled cau@@ ti@@ ously talks and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which helps to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen still got off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it is not running in all markets .
in the recall action there is a whi@@ r@@ l around a term .
Volkswagen launches in the second half of the year with the delivery of deliveries .
&quot; thanks to its many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer continues to provide a further advantage over the past year . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sales , as the company posted in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July than in the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year period . &quot;
in the home market Germany the deliveries bag@@ ged around almost one sixth .
brand sales leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , a department store has been restra@@ ined by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas was first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the main operating brand of the Lower Saxony is continuing to get off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only one delivery minus 0.@@ 9 percent to € 3.@@ 37 million . &quot;
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to point out a sales spl@@ its from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated by a software exhaust test .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls some 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , VW reiter@@ ated that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car builder makes a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate to the customer after retro@@ fitting , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as promised on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason for this is legal nu@@ is@@ ance .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen would now offer his German customers a guarantee for diesel models . &quot;
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my investigation commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations thereof are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance , no deterior@@ ations will take place and all relevant vehicle assets remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen himself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it meant in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example half a year after the retro@@ fitting , customers can come to a workshop for instance - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in the interest of the customer , it is important to avoid the fact that there is no guarantee for any other damage which has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , as was the case with regard to the possible warranty rules . &quot;
&quot; that is why VW use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or daily money accounts . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : normal savers wouldn &apos;t have to be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties .
&quot; if banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay 0.@@ 4 percent of the penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee will be charged by the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; in future , the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the cost , &quot; &quot; said the chief executive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs will continue . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the counter@@ s of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank , it would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the executive board . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changing to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operatives Union of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to wear it alone , whether it is economically feasible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their account statement , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide fees for deposits , for this purpose the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is somewhat more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it pays for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; at present no other banks are known to charge a pay@@ roll for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives vis @-@ à @-@ vis private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany won &apos;t be dropped in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged loving plates .
&quot; before you rush into the comment section , to over@@ see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ y@@ ing@@ men &apos;s middle ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of records is not a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ N@@ ost@@ al@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not hor@@ des caused by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and a gra@@ ceful thing before I stand , hold my hands and say something special to me as : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o sin@@ ks slowly to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a si@@ ze@@ able number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and sold items that he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I smoke not and I do not drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a wave of people affected by the media , who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom on followers of the record revision of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record business offers a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers were offen@@ ded by the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar gram@@ ophone sleeves , from objects that wake up happy youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with oneself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; is an employee of a record stack . &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the report , I would probably look very concerned while stro@@ lling through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( number of middle @-@ ages ) , has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so that I can put them into the shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produc@@ t@@ less , less classical . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly get in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ tet pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ ep out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks odd , but wet psych@@ ic trauma is hard to det@@ ach if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a shop window than a wholesale purchase .
&quot; she does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; she drives away with a si@@ ghted si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I &apos;m giving the impression that jeans pants are to be mut@@ ed , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group up for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying an Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees it - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ os for more , there &apos;s nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that spends most of luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my investigations showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not stro@@ lling through plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the scroll through records , while they avoid the star@@ ving view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , raising about the shoulders of no middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a trial this week the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be entitled to demol@@ ish 72 provisional transactions , in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to final drinks , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which a fire and health risk can be found .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the judgment that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups do not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also made it possible that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely nour@@ ishing people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is generally used and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp was rising to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the olymp@@ ic time , we don &apos;t want to miss Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I continue to keep the world championship in view , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; to be honest , it &apos;s hard for me to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyse in peace which reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin really wanted to fight for the title at the World Championship in Qatar in October .
I will look at everything exactly what we have changed in recent times .
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time world champion , who had lost over three minutes more than three minutes to the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday at 5@@ 4,5 km . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adjust to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the tem@@ pos@@ ters should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; for example , the Fut@@ ur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is adher@@ ed to with a stationary shield . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile building can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ pi@@ ent outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities are also flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji master@@ class gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
&quot; Fiji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ing , back @-@ back , line @-@ run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to it in the final . &quot;
&quot; but , regardless of this , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult road behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot;
here they only lose one .
&quot; this can@@ opy will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji started wonder@@ full and allowed the attacks G@@ Bs out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in bus . the World Series W@@ inners went up 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was crossing the corner . &quot;
Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner with four minutes of playing time .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a hard drive from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has stopped Fiji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ join and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still p@@ onder@@ ed . &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; GB brought fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the Sou@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , sw@@ elled flags and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s playful approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ ff sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the GB cr@@ ated cr@@ ushing into the grass . &quot;
&quot; in the early days , Fiji Japan defeated 20 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als and Britain pushed South Africa into a short semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a goal among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inous gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the ru@@ dder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she went to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the Second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th unused capacity , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no one more useful than the coach , who would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to get better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing itself is a challenge , but that makes it even greater . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a busy morning talking a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much that means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very trapped at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear on a wedding next week , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; water@@ proof@@ ing association , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of a long time ago in the original piece in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
&quot; little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the purpose of the Government . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; applies &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband workforce , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , transports approx . 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants per year . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are church @-@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller ceased as a water guard in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Union in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work via office and organization activities , household planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency missions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , real estate purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and reimbur@@ sement of farmers , the new purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the parts re@@ modelling of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and you have always resum@@ ed innovations because water is de@@ de@@ fle@@ cted and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has set himself up with a lot of blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the Water Pur@@ pose Law as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received a great deal of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ growing and re @-@ structuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the rup@@ ture of the tu@@ b@@ ular at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees it is necessary to work throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it .

&quot; when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed she had to die . &quot;
&quot; the now eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago , however , is well forward and now now privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ist . &quot;

relationship at the Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on a partner
&quot; on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) shot on his partner and injured them . &quot;
&quot; the man called us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and after him I was publicly punished . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road by car .
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have released a photo of him . &quot;
it is however a few years old .
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald face . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ings or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but they confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing delicate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are not currently saying , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , there was a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity support are from the table .
&quot; the German Steel Industry Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutscher Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) , said it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy conversion in the German steel industry , said German Federal Minister of Economics ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption .
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG @-@ circum@@ stance of 20 percent will be applied . &quot;
&quot; however , this is also not applicable in the steel industry . &quot;
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its own electricity production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; is that first step . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emissions rights trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall head Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation worsen@@ ed as the world &apos;s largest producer , China threw steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imported import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , have raised the economic outlook in China . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price of prices is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; in the last years , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude closing of individual works . &quot;
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the economic association Stahl announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been down by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : she was a young girl in the school choir , she finished music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; speaking and organising , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sen@@ iors exercise deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly demands his lungs , is not so fast out of the powder in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in older generations the common singing had a much greater significance , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often linked to positive emotions of her youth age . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people themselves deny long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people who live alone , practise not only concentrating on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , L@@ enz recommends . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , one can easily join himself . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader .
many elderly choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; those who want to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on the k@@ itt@@ ens of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the call of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ ew also didn &apos;t let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the level of breeding of cat babies on the mi@@ ch@@ iness of the little ones .
&quot; they react ten percent faster on sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who believe in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary College and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ de of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not meaningful for the males , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the en@@ act@@ ress of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cry with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness distinguishes . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for three minutes from the throwing box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ ams from stronger k@@ itt@@ ens that were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , answered the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off . &quot;
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop@@ mental with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males had re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , no matter if they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , Turkey takes place again an important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the fall attempt in July , the government , which should not be affected by normal citizens should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the put@@ sch attempt . &quot;
&quot; in the process , it is not stopped even before the football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South American living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ kü@@ r should be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although the exception of 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , however , it has as good as no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ keepers &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Workers &quot; Club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in view of the dramatic experiences of the Turks , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; even the fans agree , no matter if their heart beats gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne held its sporty value in the expi@@ red season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his crew .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; also came out early in the Europa League . &quot;
&quot; in the south of Li@@ g , only sixth was enough . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we &apos;ve done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
&quot; first of all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rone @-@ King laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; with the Treaty standing and Bes@@ ik@@ tas only , the Gom@@ ez had only announced after the attempted coup attempt to return to Bes@@ ik@@ tas because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do so , the storm would have to be ready to for@@ ego about a third of its worth 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight medals in Rio .
the topic of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who , after a dop@@ ing lock had acc@@ ru@@ ed her start right in front of the games , was whi@@ r@@ led out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it offered a bizarre scenery : with an infl@@ ated smile , she was still proud of the hall and provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who go to the start despite a dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already two times locked for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic Champion of 2004 and former World Champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after being proven by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had suffered severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , World Champion of 2013 and European champion , was positively tested on the forbidden stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the deliber@@ ate intake and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great Gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and was closed for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , mut@@ ated mer@@ ride . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an ) : hardly any ath@@ lete have been recognised as many medals subsequently . &quot;
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after it was established with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
&quot; he also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games , based on a verdict of the International Sports Court , CA@@ S . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record female and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but still allowed to start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - injured Austrian - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Foreign Ministry spokes@@ man , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; it has suffered cuts and has been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
her home@@ trip was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this regard , the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , so waste . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up again , and according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ onation close to the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holiday@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded by an urban employee explo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast demanded several injuries . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning , prior to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to speak about possible motives , but it is probably a matter of the actions of the Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it assumes that the bombs were put by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities had received secret advice on forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and the places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
&quot; the police showed their officials across the country to enhance security all around key government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j over the years .
&quot; according to the former bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the orders of the Thai security authorities on its homepage . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( Level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to pen@@ alize chaos while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , resist@@ s himself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
&quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok one stop was killed by a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine , 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the Constitutional Court also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; evidence for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic principle , &quot; said Dr. Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ iling , the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitu@@ tion@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the decision , Ma@@ ze said that his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Chief of the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to talk to young people , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; the Islam@@ ists would , as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
this is not a concrete advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is intended to attract people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , several federal states had reported reports on the contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - is extrem@@ ist , changing its direction and becoming so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party . &quot;
this is not evident .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in right @-@ wing criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be ri@@ ghtful terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may be quite possible that other right @-@ wing terrorism groups or small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes , or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of legal terrorism , however , is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about that , Ma@@ ate vo@@ iced that many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene did not appear before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of asylum lod@@ gings have not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have become radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympics or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the brave appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV images . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in the social networks Hab@@ te became a viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a reg@@ ression of 48 seconds and reached the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not straight sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more famous .
&quot; since most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ hale . &quot;
&quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; prosperity belly &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m free style , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention to the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney .
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of free style . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at the new place has been fo@@ aled .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , the cas@@ hier was about 250 Euro . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is not available as well .
Tru@@ mp is not so close to the threat of electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there &apos;s nothing to do with the US president &apos;s choice , Donald Tru@@ mp has an Altern@@ ati@@ vide@@ e . &quot;
he then goes to the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; in his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post is entering the trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently large .
the mail plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
&quot; in brief , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; from the coming year , the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free market . &quot;
&quot; we want to start selling to third parties , &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has tested for months , whether they will ship their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there was always demand , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to enter into mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and a layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ de had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and to break a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we surround the entire fleet .
the stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been on the streets of Germany since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the return cuts suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again the dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management are the worldwide number five of the industry before a new beginning of staff .
GF@@ RP CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahler is already leaving the supervisory body with effect from September 12 .
&quot; the management in the Executive Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ erk@@ inger as of September 1 , divided the company . &quot;
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; CEO &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; as a reason for the withdrawal , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details did not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; who will , in future , be responsible for the market research company , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , in the shareholders of the shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring was largely due to the continued success of the years ago . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip . &quot;
&quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad fi@@ ber@@ glass business figures , all shareholders will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would also do the Qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was mainly attributable to the lower value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the depreci@@ ation required in the Consumer Experience division of EUR 139 million , which resulted in a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million in the Group &apos;s Consumer Experience division . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into tren@@ ches in dit@@ ches : eight injured persons
&quot; with an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; according to the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a coach from Eisen@@ ach , the driver had to ev@@ ade an opposite truck , which partly drove on the reverse track . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade freed the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured passengers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called for the driver and possible witnesses to report themselves to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter wastewater amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of € 2.@@ 10 instead of € 2.@@ 10 . for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase once again , if appropriate improvements are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a rapid calculation of the calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was approved for approval of the budget for these sewage installations . &quot;
&quot; due to legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ covering . &quot;
&quot; from October 1 , 2016 citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period are to be equ@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Schmidt founded the serious fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with a very low level of waste water , weighing between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expendi@@ tures , the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period of all three plants remains largely due to its age . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for the Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage system Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage . &quot;
&quot; after nearly 20 years old conveying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and in the pond sewage plant Lop@@ p , after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be ag@@ itated , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es and an additional ventilation possibility to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came the continuing care and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still significantly below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waste water incidence in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Schmidt was spar@@ ed the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in terms of stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal waste water association could not be expanded because they are defici@@ ent entities . &quot;
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % have been booked . &quot;
the annual average flow of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critici@@ zed as an Asian cartoon
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is not sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are unique , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all ab@@ err@@ ations reach the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past that they were accused of promoting the Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when some users suggested a filter this week that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat communicated that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was designed as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders experienced , the filter reminded of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets were widely distributed over the photos that the filter was &quot; inj@@ uri@@ ous and lu@@ cr@@ ative . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the aver@@ ting extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride dra@@ per@@ ate .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s big audience of young people - who are more than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier &quot; , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for the medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on the medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rapid @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that is largely ignored by Snap@@ chat . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a staff responsible for interrup@@ ting the population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that she is closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence information , notes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; United States Central Command , military members of the United States Central Command , changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Ar@@ med Forces of the Ar@@ med Forces , Intelligence Com@@ mit@@ ees and the Defence Committee , reports great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence gathering of high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders typically took a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015 .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com affiliated publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 the heads of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
&quot; the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to live after it was added , that analysts worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed information while the investigations will be continued .
&quot; in addition , the Cent@@ com reports are ongoing by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the implications of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; den@@ ounced the morality among analysts and &quot; gave little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the White House intervention in the Cent@@ com Analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , which was taken up after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts at times have quite diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigation will have a re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air@@ campaig@@ agne under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim , which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the alle@@ gations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ tique of the Secret Information on the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , stating that the government held air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US wins fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is im@@ minent &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American campaign team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a worthy achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
but she knows that : the Americans are at the Olympics 4 @-@ 0 and are also in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place that remains un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two within their group will reach the first and second place each . &quot;
the first placed will take the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; whatever the game on Saturday , the American women have spark@@ ed a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London games at the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better one . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the London work that we have now .
we have been able to rip the ru@@ dder completely around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a flash@@ back from the close range .
&quot; India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling and in@@ es@@ capable , a quick relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ bands to float to the turbo meet for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you cannot stop the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coff@@ es@@ hop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there &apos;s Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is present for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock of dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names to be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV ads , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olymp@@ ian tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade , are the sports that are not generally accepted : gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I hum@@ bly make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many people , I questioned , did not know that it was an Olympic port . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share them for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown &apos;s school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earth bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has a humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ onist trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending bul@@ war@@ k - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ uss@@ ing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic programme , you will be evaluated according to execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the goal , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t just ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also another high @-@ pit@@ ched goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel as a we@@ ary when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she jumps off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up again . &quot;
&quot; here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ gl@@ ers and the objective of male athletes - as the male US tur@@ ner suggested recently , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his after @-@ air , new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long A ally of the United States &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but over the last few months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and disper@@ sed in more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; when you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
all the youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold relating to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a far @-@ si@@ ghted election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to exploit turbul@@ ence over the past few years and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of falling under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does block access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially among protests , many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians made their way to the protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high @-@ lands , have prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but that too changes .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ er dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ary Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , which , according to analysts , apparently sli@@ pped from the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ hor@@ rence of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month Prot@@ esting in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , managed by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for da@@ ron@@ ing flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently concluded that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin line of ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his statement Obama has been founded as IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would not have been serious the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot;
this clari@@ fication prompted new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public .
&quot; it also brings along his comrades who seek to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , to explain to the peculiar position , which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp insi@@ sted on the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement somewhat by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate would not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism ki@@ cks down to Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried again to return to this subject again .
he warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; naturally I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the language limits in the policy and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clear &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his say@@ ings vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an et@@ ched sound , because his demand values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead in the federal states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to excuse for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he focuses increasingly on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of the Tru@@ mp , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; says Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mps &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama I@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government of Obama , in the Clinton administration , served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread it aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; ahead of the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp left his attacks on the media and accused them of going round and pre@@ occupied on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s excuse as a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ amed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people considered it the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also new invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural beau@@ ties .
&quot; the café does not serve any beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , formerly lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she gave up coffee for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they are drinking coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same thing .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap shop has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pre@@ tends to put them out , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ bar wants to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands on an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , it was said that entering the restaurant and the order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refin@@ ing Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Bri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was talking about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; was told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , snow@@ y snack in Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ amm@@ ers , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; men &apos;s teams cooked for male Fel@@ dar@@ bei@@ ter and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marked the ways that the country turned around not to be the Land of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland anymore . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when the Americans were a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as excited : mysterious food like bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole recovered as &quot; &quot; wonderful way , food residue &quot; , &quot; noted Ziegel@@ man , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare ser@@ ene luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures were tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication took preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household econom@@ ists , among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 , had such an effect on the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; &quot; and transform the challenge of transforming pamp@@ h@@ lets like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mir @-@ cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen kitchen , he fed like the million@@ aire man from the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room , wearing a tu@@ x@@ edo . &quot;
he was a stranger to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the An@@ no@@ un@@ cement of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosev@@ elt made it possible that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the types from the era of Great Depression , cop@@ ing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs again . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; at the writing of the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law , for example how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; They did indeed make people sick . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
&quot; after the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cleared , they and Co@@ e made a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um @-@ dessert , which President Roosev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved a bit reluct@@ antly to t@@ ame a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E won three strikes three times .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung has saved almost 60,000 people life . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian shelter , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; as a hero he never saw himself , said the picture : &quot; for me it is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks mostly come to the surface only in the winter .
&quot; after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research vessel , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will only receive children with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , acceler@@ ates the five meter long animal to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a stal@@ em@@ ate for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which for verteb@@ rates means a world record . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution bi@@ ologist , though , presum@@ ed that Greenland sh@@ arks are being stone age . &quot;
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter at the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
&quot; their slow motion was , when they issued six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver looking down from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland arks that catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; therefore , after the early 1960s , their birth was supposed to fall into the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon attempt . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in their l@@ enti@@ sts , all the larger Greenland arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers was even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known .
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s hair with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters is no accident .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose neck at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals frequently runs on a flame @-@ flame . &quot;
so they later mature - and age more slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal eats heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources rather in a long life . &quot;
construction site in a double pack
&quot; in the recent session , the community at the latest meeting focused on topics related to building . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee adopted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ zel@@ i@@ fication and access questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying have been clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Street Road &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section of Bin@@ der@@ straße ) , are no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and old sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , construction wil@@ lows can immediately report to the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots the municipal council is expected to be advised in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also obtain requests for the establishment of further business enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of under@@ time lar@@ n , the industrial area already declared there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; thus , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Competence Field of Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far been granted approval in the UK . &quot;
that &apos;s what big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to store jobs .
&quot; the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lobby comp@@ etes with 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is responsible for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg ad@@ jour@@ ned a large fund industry , cutting edge but also worse in the infrastructure of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city has an easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not that easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder says . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the banks for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even though quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; says I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um &apos;s most important financial center in Europe , London will remain the economic researcher . &quot;
&quot; the balance of power also speaks for this : according to numbers from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector worked in London , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. government judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the refund of the legal costs you have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ t from a damages payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of mer@@ ck , which was linked to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of mer@@ cks , including the opinion of Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was collected on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of State Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a decree of the cost that arose during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead that can cure the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case dates back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took each other su@@ cked and landed property on laboratory work , of which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the active ingredient in the medications of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; from the US , troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; from the US , troops supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , a group spokes@@ man said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , following the extract of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they have liberated over 2,000 civilians held ho@@ stages held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS allied Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are running clean up , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s earning 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton has published its tax return on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations from the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argued for his refusal to have a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Democrats &apos; candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise funds for charitable organisations , his business affairs and various other connections , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades , and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politicians reported that Tru@@ mp has not or only paid very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a subject in the campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has here his seat , Tru@@ mp to meet their tax statements . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the elec@@ tors and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clinton , which is now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s tax returns from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 were related to income , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main funding was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ powder and fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements in people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea to do so years ago , has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their houses and harvest without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many spe@@ e@@ ders have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the Twitter day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ating of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust of ch@@ ili@@ powder into the air . &quot;
a touch quite usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility represents a thro@@ wer , who shoots a gold fire@@ work fire@@ works into the air , causing a noisy , bright explosion . &quot;
City Council unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ os@@ ks building on St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

&quot; on the request of the new building of a sales ski@@ osk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s , the town council lo@@ aned unanim@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in principle we welcome new business@@ men , but at this site in exposed location on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed according to &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch , after announ@@ cing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election as it claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of hotels .
&quot; the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind him was , in the director , even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is dropped , &quot; &quot; the cler@@ k was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed from this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged appeal of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly proved all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement &quot; &quot; not to record Israel into the quick @-@ list &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesperson for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code now has been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ let for prot@@ esting bra@@ zi@@ lian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they assembled to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the prot@@ esters saw Gra@@ ffi@@ cking against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from the Office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest in Russian @-@ based businesses grew strongly , shared the ambassador with them . &quot;
Russian companies assume existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade fair was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation issued approximately 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , affecting the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken down last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market in forest @-@ br@@ ittle fall over
a rob@@ ber@@ y accident has been carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a gun , three dark dressed persons , who had ver@@ m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the cler@@ k of the beverage , then at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW @-@ Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share with them . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the market deck of the Re@@ we market and is badly visible .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators have to be ban@@ ished after the attack in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot located opposite the car park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
those who have been observing for the Tat@@ zeit ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack are urgently supposed to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : playing and Fun at Summer Time
&quot; eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and youths of the social educational daily group / social group work of the Nag@@ old child care centre with their car@@ ers at their summer break in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the secluded recreational area of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ aking with the visit of the string z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days , the group pleased themselves in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swim and plan . &quot;
&quot; children and coaches with their self @-@ made cour@@ ty@@ ards like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and Tübingen Bolog@@ n@@ ese were treated . &quot;
&quot; workshops were created , beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ wall@@ fahrt of all the min@@ ers in the next two years , the Mini@@ stries of St. Anna have decided to prepare for several days of pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage objectives were examined and one finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at Frei@@ burger Münster . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern went their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and divided the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was transported by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster , Our Lady is standing , and so the pilgrimage route from Münster has been started . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were framed in the morning and evening with a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again made rest and sing a song from specially @-@ assembled pilgri@@ m songs . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty , high @-@ quality dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen we went to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags on that stage were the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , however , at the time of the high @-@ rise heat , at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a barbecue at the pool in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the closing cap to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived in Münster later on in the afternoon and passed through the doors of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; at the evening Mass in Münster , the Min@@ is greeted by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ itt@@ any wins gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ ump and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand .
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championship in London . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an exception .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that had un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner played an Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which one drove in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inners to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der than they got on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and the World Champion is defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the 2012 triumph on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ des admitted that he dropped off on the track after a weak start . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; It feels with all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ ys it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
&quot; that would mean Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will be the next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition in the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth four kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at the target in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had fought with representatives before the qualification , when officials called him function@@ aries to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which is continued tomorrow and ending , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is relying on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were down . &quot;
&quot; it played Dra@@ mas in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amid sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ y and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that now , the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melt production of Port@@ land due to the cancellation of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus lifts all supply contracts , such as the delivering energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is scheduled to run in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; no less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect , could be endangered in the event of a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could be a dom@@ ino effect , as the melt engine consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that there are three other owners to announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is privately owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting pot , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which would have been in force as of November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; that is why AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential effects on the AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual decline in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa told Al@@ coa that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the power supply to the enam@@ el &quot; &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still another explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions in the sector , analysts warn against the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land spends approximately 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n and in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ ee@@ zed story almost every birthday episode of a child &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we forgot you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that looks like a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista have been advertising by the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were se@@ ep@@ ed before the official announcement .
&quot; Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s include women already on the cover . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised them . &quot;
these feelings cooked again when the news came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but , on the mis@@ fortune , it seems to pass by at the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her paintings by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centres annually exhibit 160@@ ,000 people annually &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies have been ab@@ duc@@ ted annually by the municipal offices , while the industry is taking on the effects of further cuts of funds on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and the like - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already under full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is envis@@ aged that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the Director of the Municip@@ ality Centr@@ es of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the latest survey of the National Union of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need of government will be forced from Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and the Federal Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately cancel these mid @-@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp Elec@@ toral Campa@@ ign accused after workers allegedly pulled weapons
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action after being told that their campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun weapon for a staff in February while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment which was submitted on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up , for months , to have been waiting for the matter to be regulated internally before it realised that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the barrel into Vinc@@ ent &apos;s knees , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his charge . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd of people in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; were to take action , if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges were to appoint judges . &quot;
the Tru@@ mps campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words out of the context and that he would not attack violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip because of bodily injury and lasting mental damage .
hope Hi@@ cks was not able to reach Tru@@ mps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls during its consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has now led to a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey in front of states elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are noticeable for the SPD and CD@@ U governing parties . &quot;
&quot; this was shown by representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to reign , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have a good chance of continuing to face the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; the party sounded , according to the survey , only just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight loss of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Green Party was once again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament with 3 per cent respectively .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD of the survey , according to the survey , was only 23 percent in 2011 ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they still smile behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro , fans can still buy the equipment on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer show C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator reached . &quot;
&quot; even accessing websites was possible using HTML browsers , though qu@@ el@@ ingly slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was finally sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market leaders are masters , all of whom came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; being online always and everywhere , this is a lot of everyday life for many people today . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion Smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , an entire industry has developed around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , today , every German has seen 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get away from the smartphone , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens management board . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and all over London .
&quot; for me it was the biggest attraction for He@@ a@@ yers , just as it was in London in 2012 , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were benef@@ iting from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs created , and youth unemployment in the airport environment will end . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding he@@ aders is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ elled on the world stage .
&quot; the two @-@ f@@ unders were wrong in 2012 , and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question posed to it . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , to create £ 2@@ 11 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; about ad block@@ age &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising revenue , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display loos@@ ening on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it told users to update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams , spokes@@ man for Ad@@ block Ben Williams , wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight has been under way since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying displays have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook with their mobile devices , Mobil@@ e@@ Adverti@@ se accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising assets . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the company has shared ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; on desktop PCs , advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so that Facebook will make the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad pres@@ by@@ ent@@ ool &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt agent , which is why we focused instead on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman on presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspi@@ cious suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that , at the age of 49 , a Swiss woman wanted to kill several vehicles , including a truck , to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , told me to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases where a person running in the dark on the highway was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was called in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after crossing a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious in the street .
&quot; the Court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ mam@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model has been designed to determine whether Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere could once have identified similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved on . &quot;
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the heat heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model has produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers .
&quot; although it was once believed to be hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans were evap@@ or@@ ating and their steam was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen@@ es left only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect , the Venus that we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low co@@ determination rights in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I have been thinking about how to improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a right to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 . &quot;
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the night season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of five points behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadian and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers recru@@ it talks again , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the struggle for wages for North Sea oil workers will be exposed , while all the armed parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop some day @-@ to @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts give the company the necessary space to get through the market swing .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to ren@@ ounce its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ col@@ ade with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson , at the beginning of this week , met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the star@@ ring of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at different rates and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planet creation .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star @-@ run , which originated around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; to peak rotation rates , these mature stars come from large quantities of star win@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star ages old , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a visible star@@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest rotation rates catalogue indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than solid stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , while larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very light stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much more to learn about how the How , When and Why Stars will slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have detailed in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star turns off
&quot; with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base . &quot;
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract , gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the Hall of Bas@@ eball . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field , his appearance is beyond the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted forbidden ster@@ oids to be taken between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a development in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor to me for 2014 , because I have played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time swe@@ dish . &quot;
also his farewell days were not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy to the fans from Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; &quot; sang the supporters at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ team . &quot;
&quot; Olympic 2016 : s X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio may not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a caught ath@@ lete had won almost a medal .
&quot; ahead of the 7th race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately preceding the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these news are coming to the un@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mass@@ aging means for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the lectures over 50 m free style . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing applied for . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news was se@@ eping through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this was an unbelievable shock , &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be a dietary supplement , &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the forbidden substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ specimen is also supposed to have had a positive impact . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately announced his criticism of the ath@@ lete &apos;s word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation cannot take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the fall of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was announced , the London Olympics Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before . &quot;
&quot; both cont@@ end the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had forbidden the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , even the runner nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the earlier off@@ ences in China also caused severe disputes between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
sun Y@@ ang pe@@ elt li@@ la .
&quot; when I see the Podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive for the trio of stimul@@ ants in China in 2014 , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; Dat@@ am@@ Blue : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ resses , chi@@ pper their ran@@ som . &quot;
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently using targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months became at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software , according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , to attack in company networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential for extingu@@ ishing ran@@ som is considerably higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ es programs were designed to send advertisement . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ ests took place rapidly in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , she searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; in order to get the final code code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without the production stopp@@ age . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware is added . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop operating activities completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients could be threatened by the loss of patient records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : does not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ times in the company . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they account for their victims via chat on how to pay by Bit@@ coin , free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t example files for free . &quot;
&quot; and , after payment of a few hundred euros , individuals are redeemed , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers become increasingly professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual ex@@ pres@@ ser .
&quot; the malware kits have been created by the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of supply includes an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail printers are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made for each machine .
&quot; usually the criminals will commission the sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies &quot; IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust them to rep@@ hr@@ ase Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Def@@ con Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators , instead of heating the heating in the future , block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off there . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; it is not only a suit@@ case of 4@@ 53 l and is available with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema armchair and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the height of the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; he should , however , do his work a little qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; in the tested &quot; Executive &quot; top variant , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems belong to the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assist@@ ent ( working up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot;
&quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because in sh@@ inning many obstacles are evaluated as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent speed control responds to the traffic sign detection and d@@ ashes the speed when required .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel systems are fine . &quot;
&quot; who does not want to invest as much , will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel engine from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standards .
the HR @-@ V offers Honda a versatile and everyday vehicle .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline will not be liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued for a liability only if possible , which are typical of air traffic . &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee with the overthrow .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
diar@@ rho@@ ea : when to pay the organis@@ er
&quot; after their journey , they only return money if the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel without any doubt . &quot;
&quot; this is , however , only the case if more than ten percent of the guests proved to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family was severely ill in diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door wed@@ ges . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective sewage treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family was the opinion that the journey was in@@ significant - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
&quot; however , the organizer only learned about it shortly before the pla@@ inti@@ ffs were left . &quot;
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since there were no contamination in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; said Mr de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must ins@@ ulate and respond at the same time to terrorist haz@@ ards .
&quot; certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if the offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , this hei@@ gh@@ tens the security and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the German Bundestag elections in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personal gain of security forces , &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce will be revised to make it more difficult to purchase weapons in the internet . &quot;
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to find solutions , how the endanger@@ ing of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything , which helps to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly opposed ac@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality . &quot;
&quot; it is a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , which he considers to be constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; they can talk about rules about road traffic , or for witnesses to court . &quot;
green boss Simone Peter designed the minister to simulate new anti @-@ terrorist acts and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist acts .
the left party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence do not bring people in this country any more security . &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway exit
it st@@ ole regularly on the b@@ ypass - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the rule of law is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers , who stand in traffic on the ambient street every evening in traffic jam when driving through the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , the state @-@ run road construction will extend in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Stra@@ its exit at 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then right to right from the Hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic con@@ veys early , whereby the entire sequence will be improved on the busy segment of the federal road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
&quot; the road nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ go path and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler street .
&quot; from here , traffic is only drawn in one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back almost three quarters years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to record the heavy load traffic in two tracks . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated factory daily St@@ au continue , the responsible country operation cannot be said . &quot;
&quot; however , it is to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official rest period up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal waste treatment , Landes@@ betrieb deliberately chose the more traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned with . &quot;
the traffic is passed on on Tuesday and on Wedn@@ es@@ days at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with mig@@ rational and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy theatre in Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years attended the staging of the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims for the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the youth of the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to chore@@ ographies , scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the boys Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ y@@ cles , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background are to receive the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatrical play and theatrical language education are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star @-@ mou@@ ths : hope for weather improvement
&quot; the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night on Friday made a line by the bill , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle spectacle , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of star@@ lets in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ters are per@@ sei@@ ds , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour , one of the fastest rows of stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around for hours , at night you lie down for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think about sleep well before the alarm clock . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of causes underlying , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ gery and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands inland , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , an inhal@@ ation and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the sleeping @-@ sleep experiences many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs can be stuck . &quot;
&quot; not in@@ frequently , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors might need one another .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , We@@ eks gives an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and be com@@ promised on the day , you should go to the doctor , advises We@@ aving . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look quite different : you are beaten , tired , ed@@ ged , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , abandoned sleep medi@@ ators hardly exist in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep @-@ medical center at the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why one should contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , advises her . &quot;
it can clarify if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example in snor@@ ing with breathing @-@ outs , in case of disease fatigue , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please do not make n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after ch@@ illing , you go to bed at your normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera sets the sleeping end on the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a number of adjusting screws on which to sit for a better sleep .
&quot; weaving counts : regular sleep and rise times , not long in bed , don &apos;t sleep too long , don &apos;t sleep long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , avoid watching alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming to have
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time and simultaneously set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself against his ex @-@ team mates in the criticism of the critics . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives € 20,000 bonus and a jungle King 150@@ ,000 € , nobody should be surprised about the missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , while dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see exactly or even operate on the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say the controls should be set here , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ties had to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who do not have a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; says the choice ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de arrested by Bag@@ gage Di@@ ver
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
civil f@@ ences of the Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and baggage ste@@ els as bands .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the mid @-@ July of this year and were , in doing so , proc@@ eeded in a joint and professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts , which were specifically directed to commit criminal off@@ ences to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in total , they had captured a total of 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the R@@ ī@@ ga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem like that , but the police are one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes the play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
someone has spra@@ yed &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; on the façade of a grey house .
&quot; as opposed to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , in recent weeks , they are favor@@ ed with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel had repeatedly called for a harsh action of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers went down under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk vor@@ m late . &quot;
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the neighborhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who attracts three children here , is generally anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the Hau@@ tes Project , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a neighborhood , which is desper@@ ately looking for police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ asing lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police open between domestic occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , that also today in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer street near Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a down@@ right street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on rec@@ alled discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown into colour bags . &quot;
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences constitute material damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house near the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : the people in 94 are their neighbours , which have not been determined . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , are no longer there in Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the educated architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to Riga Straße - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important to her that the residents got their way back : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which supp@@ ress the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are apartments , which are not interesting for many , here are people who are not so well be@@ amed , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what shall we do if a person never li@@ stens to it ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are anno@@ yed by color bombs : the Hau@@ tes Projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the neighborhood .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub quarter , compla@@ ining badly about noise . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee agent
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the patron of Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the management team for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , work gangs for refugee assistance , administration , authorities , and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ei@@ ghty wo@@ ol@@ ly mil@@ k@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; thus , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to en@@ roll the place . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , just an experienced wool mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not a central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the local authorities themselves . &quot;
responsibility changes from the Coun@@ cill@@ or Office to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it didn &apos;t work to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be in@@ famous as it is called so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed residence , there are tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hips , training centers , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and expenses for refugees and migrants who need to be gre@@ edy or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that is motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; that is , &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so you need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here , administration and volunteers jump here . &quot;
it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , do not want to work and be useless , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there are problems also , says customer honest , &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a mam@@ mot@@ h task .
&quot; a difficult question : do they have fear of radic@@ alization after the latest incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client clearly , &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; a residual risk could and does not want to exclude it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins bring them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new assault on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that Ur@@ bacher is already busy integrating the previous people .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : sought @-@ after with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew various areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the inhabit@@ ant surprised them both and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward in the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
the police deployed several strikes as well as a police helicopter .
the search proc@@ eeded without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknow@@ ns fell close to the apartment , or when they fled . &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police det@@ ecting after ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
&quot; after an attack on an ultim@@ atum to an ultim@@ atum , the police determined six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cker environment due to severe Land@@ fried@@ ens@@ bru@@ chs . &quot;
&quot; in the case of apartment searches , evidence and intoxic@@ ation were guaranteed , the police informed the police on Friday . &quot;
&quot; around 20 mas@@ ked men of a ro@@ cking @-@ like group@@ ing had thrown bottles and stones against the window of a snack , according to the police in July . &quot;

then they fled .
&quot; at the I@@ mb@@ iss and the adjacent building there was a damage of 10,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , it is about a dispute in the Ulm Ro@@ cker@@ mi@@ lieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish corridor . &quot;
