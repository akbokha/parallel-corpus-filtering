<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home to feed the food in the fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the riding career ended up again."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was at all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he left with his family about the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even hoist for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Goldene Sportpyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of honesty to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," "says Langer," "for it is not only awarded for sporting successes, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave 25,000 euros the prize money."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the torner Eberhard Giengen, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Reuters Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the skipper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports enthusiasts came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious society emigrated to the Springstadium, where the Lavazza Prize went."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the Money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - that is what Clinton and Trump want to do.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are at the helm of taxation and energy policy, as well as a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep that in doubt rather small, and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively decline regulators, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would increase, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the first place, Trump and Clinton say almost word-to-word."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil promotion should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energies with its investment program and demands:" "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage has to rushed, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, is standing on one side to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stop him so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least by the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most a year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the business manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-bred women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - not even as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard against the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: any woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as the hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the flight:" "many are secretly standing out of it because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the fact that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that as soon as they anchor in Germany, tell Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single-standing women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results in about 90 percent of the women who live in the north of Munich, traumatized, appreciate them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "some of the children certainly did not develop voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to having nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, more accommodation is needed only for them, Bahr calls."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, if they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing as governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabians, women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are in some community shelters or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together, it can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as the women feel this need of protection, you can read the crowds on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since speaking about that we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">The assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">JDC said that there would have been a ministry to address concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant doctors and medical students agreed to reject a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members that was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that" "persistently quiet" "would have remained, which led to the rejection of the treaty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "considering this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations with all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running program of escalating work campaigns that begins at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the dispute led to the fact that, in the history of NHS, Assists fought six times, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The director of the BMA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't forbid the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile worked narrowly and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" loving friend "" Putin - according to a report whole five times. "</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if nothing had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's glowing, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"going out was even bigger, as it was done by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious accusations from senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has fought this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was only held because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear."</seg>
<seg id="27">"first and foremost, Erdogan requires all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of almost his office during the last month with a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives too.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West since it responds to its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued resentment of the snail-empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state security won a bonus for asking for the attempted coup d'etat for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course that itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit of this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an" "alliance of outsiders" "to Russia and Turkey: two countries which have been violently and badly treated by the West and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even strived the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey mitigated it deliberately to answer a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shakes the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk again at least."</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino who was a deputy since 2012 was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it means (in Russian) that he later was the Director of Directors and Chief of Staff of the Governor."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state for bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow a secret place.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed to great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complaining posts for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin arrived to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin would violate the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queensferry Crossing: bridge connected with Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "Deck blower", "which are approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown today paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building Queensferry crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total decks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete offer in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone at each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the landing page."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"delicate, since the tolerances on which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they were operating only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Green Party mean that investors should be taken into duty much more strongly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "concept of action" for the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But arguments are programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A rule is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also arise in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the grand dispute in the town hall was, however, that Bratmann:" how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is to provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there is still no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of this, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program is not entirely entirely: because the roughly 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how is the loss of more around 1300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the budgetary spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of returning apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the west town, Fristen runs for the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"since the number of social housing in the west-city is increased dramatically again, one removes itself from the target of the so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke said:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go with the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their leisure time in staring on screens, has been depleted by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon tracking with a GPS and, once they have been found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that reflect the" "average" "person each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, announced that within two days after the game launch, the number of consecutive people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on health, people want to take 30 minutes to" "come from the sofa" "and" "get active" "every day, because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the Wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even hunt new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also gruirrels that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could go against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">There has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had previously been able to track our activity, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be followed up with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"due to poker's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, helping many people in hunting, active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-battle title, winning the fifth while holding her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">"she burst out in tears, when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end."</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing practices that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"they expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment."</seg>

<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes."</seg>

<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old man captain, called" Grandma, "had a lead."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first mass murderers of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in an entry, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the perpetrator fired eight shots from a handfire, while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle, is to be read in the report."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the police said that the threefold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery oversight, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims."</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in total, seven people were killed in nine attacks during four months and two more injured were injured."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard der KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"it is believed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the investigators refused to expose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked, and were committed by the same murderer."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, round off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they did not expect but masterful gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sports classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie fought all the same way as Aly and Madison to bring it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts up primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastics and families). the list can be continued as required."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the communities aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics exercise."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable Harlem in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors."</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>

<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>

<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assists appointed last night in a message with:" "assisting doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, especially that it will heat the current maternity-crisis and make it to treat all physicians appropriately."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of the Political Correctness leaves election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"last year, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur was removed from office due to corruption."</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of the Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former member of the Cabinet, intervenes verbally ignoring the police, elective observers and town halls, ignoring evidence of elective abuse on the basis of" oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an antagonist king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters take a card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter has to name only his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink on a person's finger if they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistle-blowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only for election fraud, but also the government government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community," and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia. "</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation by which a person selects as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent letter election - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guiding of ID cards to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or banistani background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions have knowingly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" oversensitivity concerning ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said 50 Recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are working on postal voting to stop" "reaping". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which will be considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters alone go to the elective cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case there was no complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Electoral Court lent Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "checkups" of the election registrations of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>

<seg id="3">"in order to worsen the situation, she patterned her, pulled her out and put her back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Primark shop at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, in which the woman tried underpants before she put her back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried undergarments," she went back and left the business, without buying anything. "</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "people could not believe what they saw.</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, frech like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when they pulled out the underpants, which you obviously did not like, as they put it back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same thing with three further underpants, before she finally decided that you didn't like anything, moved back and out."</seg>
<seg id="12">She did not seem to disturb anyone to observe - or think about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the underpants she had tried.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Ms. Davidson, 33 who lives in Kent, said," "How absurd to think that someone would take home underpants that had another person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Ms. Davidson added:" "as I have received, the employees have tried to pull the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had her and left her and she was not washed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a spokesman from Primark said:" "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August at our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or behind, this video will show you how to turn your robber around the skewer."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with the knee into the groin and turn, while the aggressor grips with pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run and move backwards while she straightens the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, grab the weapon and twist it, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time shift the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and straightening the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undermined his immune system and worm eflex of a serious test - adding some of the dirtiest and ekelest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a purge button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the emptying of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get into."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to lick the rinsing button of a pulling toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing was left over, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to railway stations to dishwashers of toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he met his reputation in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample coating showed a luminometric number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after their Luminometric number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says," "That comes close to the worst I have in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not do anything here because it is inside disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstorming which ended we said "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products only, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added:" let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by 2015 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing the attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asozial family left their social apartment after a delogization with a loss of £50,000, because it had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative possessed the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls were perforated holes on, wooden planks were pulled up, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who had meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror inflicted by the family, street fights with baseballs, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive cries, strings and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which will be demolished, old trash was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the property, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn open."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the streets and had to be invoked regularly by the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delegated her and her partners forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogierung was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one of them said," They cried for no one. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we couldn't sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years long"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the townhouse, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, since a delogierung is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police as well as members of the community who have courageously dealt with us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogierung on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to evacuate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Skeldon received a fine, after she had found herself guilty of holding a drug of class B in commercial intent."</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in 2013 during a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that they will delegate tenants who do not adhere to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police informed that delogierung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not adhere to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who were harmed by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls left London last year to join the IS, reports according to reports in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a couple of weeks ago, her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria."</seg>

<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had left the war-torn country and returned to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other school leavers from the east of London went into a plane heading towards Turkey, followed by a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge by the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect Garland to" "choose" "with a certain degree of certainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman of Reid said later that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not care for unrest with a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the highest judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="8">"after the mixed putsch, there are still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes refugees in their own country produces refugees," "said Toprak."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because stupid than so far it's not going to be: summer holidays, heat and a day-to-day-action combat - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for this purpose, practical problems come: in the holidays are helpers who hang up posters, air balloons, flyers out flyers, and end up counting voices to apply only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania once again has to pass an election campaign to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say that has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting will be how strongly newcoming AfD cuts off and what remains at the end coalitive dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the countryside, spreads roses and chatted a little with the people, just like his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sea-ering has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" We create that "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice ministry now."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes the right place at the wrong time at the right place."</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited Merkel twice chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's election of the Bundestag is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it does not pity anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the Northeast CDU has largely avoided the usual electoral campaign booths on marketplaces and malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, only plays a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"also the Union has noticed that in the country you have to crumble the base, that it needs to be very strict, to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you can hardly find it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the expanse of the country there is hardly any."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU electoral combatants Kokert is also self-exposing:" they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village-este, Golden Weddings, every birthday party has to be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were lastly behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19) in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the 2011 election, the SPD still won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to create the leap into the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of their holidays and mainly transfer their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "online campaign", "the President Claudia Müller calls it."</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, Green Party fighters embark on a search for local vocal chests among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the works, which start at 5.30 in the morning and finish only at about 20 a.m., there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the event will also be praised for those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the setting up of lodging options."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place is relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen back on both sides of the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">Escaping through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," "says the deputy chief executive director Florian King for the transport-related management of the rehabilitation project."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bach's street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many bleaches were looking and more familiar to their Navi than the signposting."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks resided in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not adhered to, the congregation called on the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant overrides," says King who, himself, made himself informed about the situation. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been slashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest way was with 77 km-kilometres at the speed-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become calmer."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 refurbishment in them led to revenue quarries, each one asks to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"for those who have less to do with the" end customer "so for other companies, the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Thomas Sulz also talks about a" slight decline "at the Autohaus Maier, but also admits that, of course, the scroll is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">"most strongly, the bars are along the road."</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants were" hit hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"at" "far more than 50 percent", "the sales revenue figures" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The road renovation has thrown its operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner on a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refurbishment."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all cases, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he points to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complex traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it's also nice somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"by the end of the restoration work, Göhner has no doubt."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner sees the effects of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its many years of history."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the name of the fight against terror, it is constantly being screwed on by laws."</seg>

<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the serene.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals were politically acceptable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Interior Minister in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">"others, further points, would first be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"also, I take part in this."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as Minister of the Interior, however, he was in results and at a" achievable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière gave a little time to pass before it presents its conclusions for the safety of the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are now all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some things are already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority is to take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second trial for proposals that have not been made with the SPD: he wants sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"that will be difficult points for the SPD," said the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he considers it reasonable and does not require any chances in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a few new ideas, de Maizière also presented."</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are in themselves: he plans rapid processions for deportations and more possibilities for the incarceration of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to pose some even worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally sanctified.</seg>
<seg id="24">"some of them are still unpublished, leaving questions open."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient, for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it can't be said that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee numbers."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people profoundly dealt with, were not clinging to election times even in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved immensely into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral struggles."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in their position on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, it went up between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"first of all, a garrison dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some of the Unions interior ministers, in which the departments also demand a burka ban and a renunciation of double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also struggles here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a departure from the double pass, he doesn't hold anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We conclude the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">You do not make sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a ban on burn, he has constitutional objections."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutive at all corners and whether it is" "reasonable" "for the coalition partner, you have to show yourself."</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things that could cause a quarrel.</seg>
<seg id="45">"however, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the subject of inner security."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged loving plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush into the comment section, to oversee him under the pseudonym non-allyingmen's middle ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the re-emergence of records is not a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but on Midlife-Nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age of between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes caused by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy road in Soho, a modest gray suit and a graceful thing before I stand, hold my hands and say something special to me as:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho sinks slowly to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a sizeable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and sold items that he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was a bit too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I smoke not and I do not drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to YouGov's profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a wave of people affected by the media, who have heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on followers of the record revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record business offers a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers were offended by the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar gramophone sleeves, from objects that wake up happy youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with oneself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like her social workers!" "is an employee of a record stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the report, I would probably look very concerned while strolling through a pile of Bossa nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (number of middle-ages), has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," "I don't own record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so that I can put them into the shelf", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productless, less classical."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly get in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesize and sextet pop instead of experimental jazz weep out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but wet psychic trauma is hard to detach if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shop window than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "she drives away with a sighted sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I'm giving the impression that jeans pants are to be muted, I watch a group of young teenage girls group up for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying an Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees it - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there's nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that spends most of luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my investigations showed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not strolling through plate shops of Berwick Street and the scroll through records, while they avoid the starving view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, raising about the shoulders of no middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a trial this week the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be entitled to demolish 72 provisional transactions, in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to final drinks, sell, barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which a fire and health risk can be found.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the judgment that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups do not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also made it possible that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais" were absolutely comprehensible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely nourishing people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is generally used and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest is eight years old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp was rising to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-steping, back-back, line-run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to it in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but, regardless of this, Fiji had defeated a 15-man team."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens under Ryan."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this canopy will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfull and allowed the attacks GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in bus. the World Series Winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau was crossing the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner with four minutes of playing time.</seg>

<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still pondered."</seg>
<seg id="22">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB brought fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijianic gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinous gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she went to the second Olympiagold in the Second Olympiagold in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th unused capacity, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no one more useful than the coach, who would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had good luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the correct term."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to get better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even greater."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a busy morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much that means, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>

<seg id="4">"the German Steel Industry Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "Westdeutscher Allgemeine Zeitung" "(SPD) of the" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "(SPD) of the" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "(WAZ), said it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy conversion in the German steel industry, said German Federal Minister of Economics (WAZ)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG-circumstance of 20 percent will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, this is also not applicable in the steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its own electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>

<seg id="18">"last year, the situation worsened as the world's largest producer, China threw steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: she was a young girl in the school choir, she finished music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good with her health and spirit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of the music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "speaking and organising, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly demands his lungs, is not so fast out of the powder in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors Organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in older generations the common singing had a much greater significance, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often linked to positive emotions of her youth age."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people themselves deny long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people who live alone, practise not only concentrating on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, Lenz recommends."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, one can easily join himself."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many elderly choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who does not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"those who want to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two explosions went up again, and according to the authorities another man was killed."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee, Friday morning, prior to journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that it is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to speak about possible motives, but it is probably a matter of the actions of the Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage restricted to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather it assumes that the bombs were put by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities had received secret advice on forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and the places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>

<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used by King Bhumibol Adulyadej over the years.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta CEO and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to penalize chaos while the country is heading towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, resists himself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order."</seg>

<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase in right-wing criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maate said he would not yet speak of new rightist terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may be quite possible that other right-wing terrorism groups or small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes, or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"a nationwide or pan-European control of legal terrorism, however, is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"worried about that, Maate voiced that many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene did not appear before."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying thing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects of asylum lodgings have not been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or voted for example, CDU, SPD or left, which, however, have become radicalised by right-wing extremists."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympics or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the brave appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly obese swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV images."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the social networks Habte became a viral Internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended with a regression of 48 seconds and reached the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not straight sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopians got a special start from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more famous.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soon the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of Whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in reference to a" "prosperity belly", "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "made fun of him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m free style, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani provided media attention to the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the buoyancy from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of free style."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase once again, if appropriate improvements are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a rapid calculation of the calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>

<seg id="6">"from October 1, 2016 citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Weldingahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt presented the committee, a new calculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the preceding calculation period are to be equalled."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in this way, Schmidt founded the serious fee increases in all three wastewater facilities with a very low level of waste water, weighing between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"as a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenditures, the recuperation period of all three plants remains largely due to its age."</seg>

<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "to these extraordinary expenses came the continuing care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which in previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still significantly below the current level."</seg>
<seg id="19">"stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low waste water incidence in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully smashed."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is not sensitive to races."</seg>

<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are unique, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All aberrations reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past that they were accused of promoting the Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when some users suggested a filter this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellowface. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat communicated that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was designed as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders experienced, the filter reminded of vulnerable clichés."</seg>

<seg id="2">"United States Central Command, military members of the United States Central Command, changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, Intelligence Commitees and the Defence Committee, reports great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering of high-level Centcom commanders typically took a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom affiliated publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 the heads of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the republicans called the Task Force to live after it was added, that analysts worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed information while the investigations will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, the Centcom reports are ongoing by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the implications of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "denounced the morality among analysts and" gave little room for dissenting opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to the White House intervention in the Centcom Analyst with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by" "The Daily Beast". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, which was taken up after complaints by Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts at times have quite diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigation will have a repercussions on the question of a successful aircampaigagne under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim, which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the allegations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the Critique of the Secret Information on the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, stating that the government held air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually be a worthy achievement, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows that: the Americans are at the Olympics 4-0 and are also in their group with the Briton in the first place that remains undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group will reach the first and second place each."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutchman a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game on Saturday, the American women have sparked a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London games at the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things into a better one."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the London work that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to rip the rudder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a flashback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling and inescapable, a quick relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is passed from the wristbands to float to the turbo meet for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot stop the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is present for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock of dimples, could have been among these well-known names to be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV ads, if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympian trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally accepted: gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I humbly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparse the last 16 years that many people, I questioned, did not know that it was an Olympic port."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in trampolines and until 2012 had an athlete, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share them for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on a trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown's school than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earth bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has a humoristic potential - the cartoonist trembling of his never-ending bulwark - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hussing and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic programme, you will be evaluated according to execution, level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-time athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they don't just chase the finish line or the output wall, but also another high-pitched goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympiarist."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as a weary when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">Forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she jumps off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up again."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anglers and the objective of male athletes - as the male US turner suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley is expecting his after-air, new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" "in Ethiopia, Long A ally of the United States"</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but over the last few months, protests against the government shook the country and dispersed in more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot and killed on umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you oppress people and don't have other options except protesting, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to the stranglehold relating to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a far-sighted election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been forced to exploit turbulence over the past few years and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of falling under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does block access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially among protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians made their way to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since eons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high-lands, have prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairer dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemary Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands were protesting against elections, which, according to analysts, apparently slipped from the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abhorrence of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month Protesting in Gondar, an amharan city, managed by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for daroning flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently concluded that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin line of tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his statement Obama has been founded as ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been serious the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification prompted new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings along his comrades who seek to take him in protection during an eventful phase, to explain to the peculiar position, which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump insisted on the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help mitigate the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism kicks down to Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign for falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" naturally I thought the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language limits in the policy and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then possibly" clear "according to how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observes the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he's clever enough to keep his sayings vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an etched sound, because his demand values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead in the federal states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to excuse for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he focuses increasingly on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocant his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of the Trump, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "says Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama IIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it Hinterbänkler, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government of Obama, in the Clinton administration, served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread it aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"ahead of the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump left his attacks on the media and accused them of going round and preoccupied on each of his words."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked over Mr. Trump's excuse as a further proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="4">"the business Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes."</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people considered it the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter," I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap shop. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"but if New York is changing, it is also new invention."</seg>
<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working in 2001 at Verb and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a client offered to provide money for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish like capers and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural beauties.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café does not serve any beer anymore, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even after being drawn to Greenpoint, she would take the road."</seg>
<seg id="27">"after the verb was closed, she gave up coffee for a while, she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that pleased me," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"now they are drinking coffee again, even if they ordered a blended Chai Tea that day instead of their usual iced coffee, which is another new addition."</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.</seg>

<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no resentment that the soap shop has taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will deal with her offer," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">"and the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints also accepted the café."</seg>

<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local saftbar wants to fill the cold-brewed coffee into the bottles and sell.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his climb to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refining Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Bride."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs last book" Chop Suey "was talking about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while in their book" 97 Orchard "was told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will be published on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, snowy snack in Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable dishes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hammers, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have put itself in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"men's teams cooked for male Feldarbeiter and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marked the ways that the country turned around not to be the Land of Schlaraffenland anymore."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when the Americans were a central, tense subject," "Coe begged, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as excited: mysterious food like breads and casseroles became a staple food, the casserole recovered as" "wonderful way, food residue", "noted Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare serene luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried, as a low-calorie and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from that time, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, household economists, among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, between 1923 and 1943, had such an effect on the country's eating habits."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks mostly come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel, this shark was allowed to return to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie will only receive children with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, accelerates the five meter long animal to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a stalemate for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland-shark which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which for vertebrates means a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolution biologist, though, presumed that Greenland sharks are being stone age."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Grönlandhaie is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter at the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow motion was, when they issued six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver looking down from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland arks that catch fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably high carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, after the early 1960s, their birth was supposed to fall into the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon attempt."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimeters in length, the lenticular nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in their lentists, all the larger Greenland arks had normal carbon-14 quantities, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland's hair with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live above all in icy waters is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose neck at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals frequently runs on a flame-flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they later mature - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal eats heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources rather in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Hillary Clinton has published its tax return on Friday for 2015, which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax of 34.2%."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the State Department."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Clinton's candidate for vice-presidency, Senator Tim kaine from Virginia, published his tax declarations from the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton."</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a blatant contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false pronouncements and retracers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged to do so by law."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers argued for his refusal to have a tax examination by the tax authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they are on the train," wrote Clinton's election campaign in Ian Sams on Twitter, referring to the publication of the Democrats' candidate of the Democrats. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Trumps critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal to raise funds for charitable organisations, his business affairs and various other connections, in particular with Russia."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Clinton has already toppled on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday, prompting the high-ranking Republican Trump to publish his tax return."</seg>

<seg id="16">"politicians reported that Trump has not or only paid very little taxes during the 1990s, and a business journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case."</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal taxes have become a subject in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">"during an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has here his seat, Trump to meet their tax statements."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next Romwallfahrt of all the miners in the next two years, the Ministries of St. Anna have decided to prepare for several days of pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage objectives were examined and one finally decided for the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy at Freiburger Münster."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruene, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern went their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and divided the pilgrimages."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb it was transported by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster, Our Lady is standing, and so the pilgrimage route from Münster has been started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the single day tours were framed in the morning and evening with a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches again and again made rest and sing a song from specially-assembled pilgrim songs."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, parishioners of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty, high-quality dinner and breakfast."</seg>

<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a barbecue at the pool in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the closing cap to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived in Münster later on in the afternoon and passed through the doors of mercy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"with a little impulse, God was thanked."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the evening Mass in Münster, the Minis greeted by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed."</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar."</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jump and made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championship in London."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an exception.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that had unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner played an Olympic chord in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which one drove in a higher gear to slow it down and enable Kenny and above all skinners to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder than they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said," "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the final round and the World Champion is defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the 2012 triumph on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that he dropped off on the track after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," It feels with all the UK flags on the tribune as London. "</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would mean Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will be the next in the sprint that starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition in the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the fourth four kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the target in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London 2012, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on security."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had fought with representatives before the qualification, when officials called him functionaries to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which is continued tomorrow and ending, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"it played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and mobbingy and the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite like that now, the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt production of Portland due to the cancellation of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus lifts all supply contracts, such as the delivering energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is scheduled to run in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"no less than 2000 jobs, direct and indirect, could be endangered in the event of a closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could be a domino effect, as the melt engine consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that there are three other owners to announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is privately owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting pot," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the treaties were so-called" hedging transactions, "which would have been in force as of November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"that is why AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on the AGL income from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual decline in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa told Alcoa that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the enamel or to ensure the power supply to the enamel" "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still another explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions in the sector, analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland spends approximately 600 megawatts and Tomago consume about 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), critical reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the clicheezed story almost every birthday episode of a child's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we forgot you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the vogue, a new era of Kardashians began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendalls's big sister Kim likes what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that looks like a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista have been advertising by the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were seeped before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss include women already on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, there were clearly more" celebrities that model "as" models, the celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce appeared on the last cover with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked again when the news came out with the appearance Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but, on the misfortune, it seems to pass by at the point."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her paintings by Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The unit weighed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather bulky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euro, fans can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer show Cebit in Hannover as an "office in the West pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also via fax was the communicator reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even accessing websites was possible using HTML browsers, though quelingly slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was finally sold to Microsoft."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the market leaders are masters, all of whom came much later than Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="25">"being online always and everywhere, this is a lot of everyday life for many people today."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were almost two billion Smartphone users worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and all over London.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me it was the biggest attraction for Heayers, just as it was in London in 2012, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were benefiting from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs created, and youth unemployment in the airport environment will end."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding headers is too big."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamelled on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the two-funders were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong at Heathrow."</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question posed to it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects."</seg>
<seg id="12">"enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in witty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole of the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, to T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequented catwalks of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams, spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams, wrote that" this kind of Hin-and-Her fight has been under way since the invention of display lockers, "and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying displays have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display lockers; almost four times as much in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspicious suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" "in an act of despair" "on the road and were hit by several cars, said the police in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that, at the age of 49, a Swiss woman wanted to kill several vehicles, including a truck, to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already heard, but some have not yet been identified, said the police who, as well as any witnesses of the incident, told me to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, distributed Gilles Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something that the prosecutor must decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases where a person running in the dark on the highway was decided that drivers don't have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the freeway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after crossing a man and killed a night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious in the street.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model has been designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could once have identified similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the heat heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model has produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once believed to be habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporating and their steam was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogenes left only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect, the Venus that we know today."</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers understand why stars are rotating at different rates and in which context the rotational periods are associated with planet creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. "</seg>

<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"to peak rotation rates, these mature stars come from large quantities of star winches."</seg>

<seg id="1">"DatamBlue: so perfide compresses, chipper their ransom."</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently using targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Malwarebytes below 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months became at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a ransomware extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, to attack in company networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential for extinguishing ransom is considerably higher than for private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwares programs were designed to send advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attests took place rapidly in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, she searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final code code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without the production stoppage."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware is added."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop operating activities completely, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients could be threatened by the loss of patient records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: does not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of downtimes in the company."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they account for their victims via chat on how to pay by Bitcoin, free accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and, after payment of a few hundred euros, individuals are redeemed, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of potentially high and relatively low-risk profits from Ransomware extortion, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around for hours, at night you lie down for hours, in the morning you can't think about sleep well before the alarm clock."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes underlying, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Schlafforgery and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands inland, however, is the Insomnia, that is, an inhalation and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in particular, the sleeping-sleep experiences many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it, organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also drugs can be stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">"not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often common in depression," "says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors might need one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to salute about everyday problems and worries, Weeks gives an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and be compromised on the day, you should go to the doctor, advises Weaving."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite different: you are beaten, tired, edged, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, abandoned sleep mediators hardly exist in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"that is why one should contact the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, advises her."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise for example in snoring with breathing-outs, in case of disease fatigue, for sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after chilling, you go to bed at your normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera sets the sleeping end on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a number of adjusting screws on which to sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weaving counts: regular sleep and rise times, not long in bed, don't sleep too long, don't sleep long in bed, don't sleep on the day, avoid watching alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, in recent weeks, they are favored with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel had repeatedly called for a harsh action of the police against the project, the area as" No-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were evacuated with 300 police officers, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers went down under the cheers of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk vorm late."</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who attracts three children here, is generally annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the Hautes Project, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a neighborhood, which is desperately looking for police protection against vandaliasing leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police open between domestic occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, that also today in comparison to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer street near Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police orders in a downright street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on recalled discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown into colour bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "left-autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the criminal offences constitute material damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house near the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is important: the people in 94 are their neighbours, which have not been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the famous burning cars, too, are no longer there in Riga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the educated architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Riga Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important to her that the residents got their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of the inhabitants as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which suppress the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are apartments, which are not interesting for many, here are people who are not so well beamed," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "I cannot approve of violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what shall we do if a person never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed by color bombs: the Hautes Projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="6">"it sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, work gangs for refugee assistance, administration, authorities, and who else is involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine Customer from the working group indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is there, the eighty woolly milksau, which has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"thus, some - less ridiculed than on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to enroll the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, just an experienced wool milksau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not a central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the Councillor Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it didn't work to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings need to be infamous as it is called so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed residence, there are traineeships, training centers, school grounds, one-euro jobs and expenses for refugees and migrants who need to be greedy or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that is motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is," "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so you need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here, administration and volunteers jump here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, do not want to work and be useless, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems also, says customer honest," people with nothing at all. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization after the latest incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine Client clearly, "what some naive might call." a residual risk could and does not want to exclude it. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new assault on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that Urbacher is already busy integrating the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
