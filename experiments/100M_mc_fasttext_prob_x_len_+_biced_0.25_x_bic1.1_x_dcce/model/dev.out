Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement building and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two and the Iranian nuclear programme .
&quot; in March , upon the invitation of the Republi@@ can Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress which has partly been considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected the election in Israel with reference to the election that was forthcoming . &quot;
Professor to have shot his girlfriend in an emergency call
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officers found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was pet@@ ri@@ fied on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already taught 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Po@@ lic@@ eman Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has done the fatal emergency at some point after it .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said that he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said that he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which the Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee of an automatic way for an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus the police found Lam@@ bs later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he completed his doctorate in the spring of Pe@@ dago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously were together some time together .
&quot; in the emergency cry , Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but kept friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both at a summer fair three years ago . &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5 September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were standing up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of cul@@ let .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
Schmid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Memorial Watch during the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; university and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that they have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 there were still 45@@ ,000 workers . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December increases .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell , send , and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am removed from a simulated steel and a length of arsen@@ ic , to be with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time travel movie ever made . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss calls for once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; Ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the fight against the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Demand figures showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp down from the top ranks , it has not worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of Real Estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at that time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mps have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has stated last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good mind of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they are &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they are &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be a candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first nation @-@ state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform effectively his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they expose their hats , republi@@ can voters think Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked , who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters tru@@ mp campaign is shown to be plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp still beats almost everyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mps leadership while the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can Candi@@ dates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ aping the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has ahead of C@@ Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they &apos;ve made up their mind .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have set their votes firmly .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mps is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as often for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists from Mexico &quot; two months ago , was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse on 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep critical His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation effort .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as it remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp will apparently do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ ways .
&quot; on Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also fur@@ ious in Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans on the Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent hell@@ ish .
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg you can find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea river .
&quot; the street costs one square meter of a rear house on average , 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers costs one square meter the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student boy in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top loc@@ alities , however , one price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at its peak here in an exceptional way .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ sha@@ ze in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to the FC Bayern to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze decided to launch a dream start into the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; by FC Bayern . &quot;
trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game at the Champions League in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; with his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership , Müller was given a good help of the Olympic champion Roberto , who left the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans ahead of the game at Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich held word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shiny .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the premier league , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were brave , but with their offensive efforts often too resour@@ ceful to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often launched on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed by O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
&quot; first , when Olympic Games , Ide@@ ye Brown beat the Poland &apos;s head ball ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians raised their hab@@ itu@@ al game , Pi@@ raeus succeeded in setting needle @-@ stit@@ ches . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was on door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain game with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training , said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to do something different is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still made one . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen &apos;s stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ ber@@ ed Bavarian fans apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , seized the security forces and presented with pun@@ ches against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not harm only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : the risk of aband@@ on@@ ment decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were risk losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the link between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ ums in smokers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking , but could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it can , however , last for more than ten years , until the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ st@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; man must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , he explained H@@ einer Boeing &apos;s head of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health until the age of old . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided . &quot;
earlier studies have pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ takes the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists reach Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity
for the repeated time on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne Arch@@ eological findings have been made .
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said Museums@@ leiter Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always moved as a specialist department for archaeological excav@@ ation care . &quot;
&quot; in the third construction section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman caught up at the train station in Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the police ask the people for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by collecting the train , she carried heavy injuries to the police according to the Federal Police . &quot;
it was taken emergency medical care and brought to hospital by lif@@ egu@@ ards .
&quot; over the reason of the ni@@ gh@@ tly crossing of the young woman , there are no knowledge of the educated function@@ aries . &quot;
the incident was possibly witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner train , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens dare , &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presents the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
TTIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ aid that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , a possibility of appeal against their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work according to their own data to an international investment tribunal . &quot;
&quot; there could , for example , be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through the companies st@@ ressing damages of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiating national laws , or implementing a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals by the European Commission as insufficient . &quot;
&quot; above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic secretary Matthias Mahl@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward . &quot;
&quot; the Commission considered important points in the reform of reform , the Federal Minister of Economics Sig@@ mar Gabriel has worked with other EU ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the demands of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks about the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ acting fol@@ ks@@ eller has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of different places , which he repeat@@ ed@@ ely draws on the map , telling about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ dly and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they were created and how it looks there in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; appeared clever@@ ly composed songs that harmon@@ i@@ ously nest@@ le close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into a great opul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ary series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be carried out in succession . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live shows him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece was released in 2005 . &quot;
overl@@ apping of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album desc@@ ends into the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; after highly productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic components . &quot;
&quot; this sixth album album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the smaller clubs got up , the stage shows become the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and a great fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring through Germany as part of a five member band .
&quot; in the dark , held in Hamburg more ! &quot;
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although here nearly 2,000 guests sit in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly ripe St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can throw the record away . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens humble himself only for an en@@ core , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually deca@@ ys under ro@@ aring applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tions
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s debut is eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister &apos;s questions . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and for the first time put on David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after lunch , with his capacity to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the area . &quot;
he called &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment it comes to a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commemor@@ ating commemor@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several Tit@@ els@@ ets stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shades ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they rely on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour put changes in order to remove the whole idea of a bo@@ unds altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pension minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader promised another policy of politics , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s surveys are confronted with resistance and that he has to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , spokes@@ man of the sub@@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dy le @-@ Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was seen with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the UK rose by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and delivered assessment of the timing of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was entered .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging messages from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares in the Mon@@ di packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports betting company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ump@@ y 21 years young , a ham@@ mer@@ ing with an upper layer of Fr@@ ise . &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
rather more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation of U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; . &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the bending @-@ construction : here is her i@@ dol , whose posters are attached to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
the suite in which the Canadian singer is living costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves half a year .
if at all .
&quot; they say : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bie@@ ber himself does not .
it has already taken care of .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertising break of the Super@@ b , he c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company fl@@ ushed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you wonder at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and Britain with his new single &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; on number 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to Pot@@ ato @-@ Ide@@ a Ide@@ a
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and indeed in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television . &quot;
&quot; since then there is a barbecue grill , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the idea has now been given to the Lebanese authorities at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and as many potatoes of the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; just as much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes to its customers .
Met@@ cash launches ground @-@ breaking campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - invasion
met@@ ry tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well via events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice makers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and store owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot going on in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; in South Australia and Western Australia , purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base , Met@@ cash could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction when printing sales and margins at the same time . &quot;
&quot; however , wholes@@ al@@ ers resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week , and to improve their stores by faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading @-@ refurb@@ ishment programs to El@@ an are expected and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism of his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious debate of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ator , where Har@@ rison had proclaimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to strike Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp hit a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m pretty busy is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the stri@@ fe , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a m@@ allet when he lost the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who has broken a b@@ ust of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around it , and I believe he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gios in the important decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish the team is fully focused on the competition , not all around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; but we try to support him , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stop , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ gged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country .
&quot; chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people , who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown period in a strip of land between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian stand @-@ by police . &quot;
some pointed out of protest foods and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border were not able to reconci@@ le a common immigration policy for a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ unken Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not set his hopes for a spe@@ edy action between Brussels and his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and expe@@ dite asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison insur@@ ers were used to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence building the government along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs reports in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban said that authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes in accordance with the new laws . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , authorities are quick to repair the fence . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to get involved , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they arrive in Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s edge in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the voters &apos; democratic voters . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a big advance in women and women , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders here is only 5 points behind . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years of age has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are at the same height . &quot;
but Clinton is still a big lead in the older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton had been in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of voters &apos; democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to have the candidate is the most common answer that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also reported their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the choices are also cited .
&quot; as the Vice President throws a potential for the presi@@ dency in the balance , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
&quot; by Clinton &apos;s supporters , more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is raised in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors sti@@ gmati@@ zed the pre @-@ election as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den performs best in hon@@ esty among the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked as Secretary of State during the term of office , most democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans are uns@@ atis@@ fied now with their declaration , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that her opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of its party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the voters on the country view Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good grades . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many don &apos;t think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near behind Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others , are losing dramatically &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters support nationwide Tru@@ mp in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and will sur@@ pass Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has dropped from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son goes up to the p@@ olls - with 19 % support from the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp much before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found a few si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tru@@ mp said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a deportation ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ ank@@ ards are filed against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si brothers attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and ret@@ ar@@ ded his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said he was loaded with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches and then he fell unconscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly war@@ med an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , to get advice to the national president of the Brotherhood , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide their utensils and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning about his injuries .
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was added repeatedly with mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died from the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for Mor@@ der &apos;s third degree for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are accused of a criminal attack and the formation of a criminal amal@@ gam@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also call them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest comes , and the house @-@ se is dis@@ ma@@ yed , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so sharply stressed that investors should not concentrate on raising interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that all the excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated due to an interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at too low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that net income deri@@ ves from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study on what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is rather flat in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest increase , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent after a current analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ ding will occur later in the growth cycle and the return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases are often promoted . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product in the proximity of its lowest point will be at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few expected that this will continue and expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest increases with such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; whether it is this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants made a bid for F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increase @-@ cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists quickly put into the shadow after the start of the recovery , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increasing cycle , the bond yields fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ out of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones believes that markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that engage in the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 aver@@ aging 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ s with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the station for his &quot; &quot; hum@@ ming &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC Bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; dec@@ eit@@ ful &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
the BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC General Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er would be working to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; on a special BBC @-@ manner . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wanted the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it was the next time an entertainment series star@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or give money to the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales increased in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones to buy
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of the UK &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales method to the Guardian . &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started shopping with their mobile phones .
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ itting , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers keep their purchases before this event that takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year saw five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealers sites crashed .
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that from £ 5 a little more than 1 £ was spent online .
&quot; for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the mos@@ quit@@ oes in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 deaths are borne by Muslims in the streets of Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is breaking down the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed , as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large @-@ mo@@ cked lake . &quot;
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the procession passed on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the mosque &apos;s ceiling and then on the concrete . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 victims who were killed , when a crane collap@@ sed by the large central mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was supported . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands that will continue to come to the city .
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used . &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man revealed what caused the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also used the group for non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of massive building project which is managed by the bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the royal family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger building projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apo@@ sto@@ lic son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
&quot; government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the deaths , and the same amount to permanently injured . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; Britain is increasingly employing arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has a rise behind them
&quot; this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q retail outlets nationwide &quot;
&quot; from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is alleged that Brit@@ ons put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men who carry out the work in their home
&quot; if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; for Brit@@ ons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ Markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services on low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 outlets of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
&quot; at the moment , men predomin@@ ated among the employees . &quot;
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that exhibit more female single households who perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branch .
we need to shift this more towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;

function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer on Wednesday because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General , Robert Ri@@ ffel discovered that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of club accounts that they were allowed to dispose in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; with approximately 400@@ ,000 euros , the damage was damaged . &quot;
the sports facilities are also indic@@ ted for financial transactions .
&quot; this fact was separated by the chair@@ person of the Sho@@ op@@ ener Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the expul@@ sion of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense was that the association had not ar@@ isen at any time . &quot;
&quot; the sports facilities had only been charged damage compensation and the sports club , for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the pas@@ siv@@ ity amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread @-@ profession of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of financial success , the withdrawal of the expense indem@@ ni@@ ties had been determined retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; that is why one has paid out a portion of the allowance charges only years later , since 2003 , when a plus was deposited on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , even package and not detailed bookings , the former ob@@ servant explained the operations . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings accounts managed to manage the two defend@@ ants , the second defend@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdrawal was not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest himself in the details of financial statements , which was important only to the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against the one functional investigation of office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; that had been set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know this for a long time .
then he said he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as a claim to indem@@ ni@@ fy .
&quot; why indem@@ n@@ ity ? , wanted judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never damaged .
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent salary , he charged only mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were unable to provide accurate documentation for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer preserved after an operating examination , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage had also been related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the exercises were made in cash , in addition to that he had to leave from his place of residence to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard runs another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the reduction in staff reductions for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will continue to disman@@ tle other jobs during the spl@@ itting up of the company . &quot;
the sub@@ stan@@ cies in the US Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology company plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion should be saved ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be affected by the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard share posted 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the company , which grew larger with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , currently divi@@ des itself : in this way , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; a dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers in accordance with its services , recently replaced the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ stan@@ cies on the change in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and more and more business can be done online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans show a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly push for rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed appro@@ v@@ ingly . &quot;
61 percent have found that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
&quot; in contrast , 24 percent are in conflict with the conflict . &quot;
51 per cent of respon@@ dents reject a collaboration with the Syrian government Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad .
29 percent were not able to decide .

&quot; the focus of the fair will be on 27 September - connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; Mobility connects &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; the Organ@@ izer of Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expects about 900@@ ,000 visitors two years ago . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; the Hungarian police deployed in the Serbian border of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and the water @-@ thro@@ wer , against several hundreds of displaced refugees . &quot;
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; behind that , a police line had formed and a water @-@ thro@@ wer stood behind the police . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially set up pe@@ pper@@ spray .
&quot; after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now declined slightly .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from breath .
also the Serbian police spokes@@ men suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
&quot; the world is watching if the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters found out that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer , and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be held . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed has put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank could possibly rely on the zero @-@ sector and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Senior Manager at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death toll at Delta State University released ap@@ ologi@@ ze
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he killed his colleague on the day and killed his colleague , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note in order to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; make it happen &quot; , &quot; indicated authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
and he said he shot someone and killed someone .
&quot; lamb said to the employee of the emergency room , that police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who possessed a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; Lamb has called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a PhD thesis on the University &apos;s website from the Delta State University . &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly strug@@ gled with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large corporate restructuring .
&quot; the Lufthansa group will save half a billion euros a year , with a better organization . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the goal of the real@@ ignment is a contribution contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , shared the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings cheap airline should be developed as stand @-@ alone as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphasizes the importance of Euro@@ wings with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;

new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict conflict with the cockpit certificate cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike @-@ off strike . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement rule for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; cockpit wanted &quot; will be able to produce viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and airline led to several strikes in the past few months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; concept is in addition to the pilot supply . &quot;
it fores@@ ees that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors stretches out to the Group &apos;s own budget line Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months with double cont@@ our
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this would bring the left outer defense to the wine and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w crashed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being put into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg cont@@ our and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has a hard time and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the dressing cabin he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then the six months will last , and he will not play in the group stage . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an el@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European champi@@ onships in France , the United Kingdom def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as The Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ ou@@ ting by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you almost know it . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , who published in 1971 Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s environmental fa@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; it was a tough choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it seems to always have an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ prints an contents of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed , hoping to see a real tree , hopes to win . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if it were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax did not read a child 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably came from Camer@@ ons Ele@@ ction &apos;s bure@@ au .
&quot; Super@@ camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there were no other immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der who chose England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ tro@@ phy .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this information related to this : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the United Kingdom @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyze as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question how much time a test hit gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got ahead of him , while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one could raise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , which I get highly in@@ sensitive . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge space , which we met very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as op@@ ener .
he made three hundred ra@@ ins right away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me very much as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game to bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in changing rooms can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team@@ mates do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made light hearted .
&quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain out of the EU ) could win , if the economy gets into a noisy machine until 2017 &quot;

foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at predic@@ ts that some member states are so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU , and not always from their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they often do not want to be sati@@ ated . &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as in the exagger@@ ated ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;

&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , possibly some such ministers may even plan deliberately not helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s campaign campaign 2017 , in order to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , suppos@@ es my friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ically the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 in 1973 .
&quot; you can feel weak about Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for themselves as a &quot; &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ch@@ ur@@ king , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseudo non @-@ in@@ lands that most of our large newspapers possess . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought in a similar way about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting dinner and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir denied the principle of the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on my back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me - seems in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ e@@ berry @-@ tendency and the wild skir@@ ts of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and TV this week said , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their exam day on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me up - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the campaign &apos;s campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sident , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ni@@ cal voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 persons , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) included Lanc@@ et , critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; Basic Edition &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said the public expected that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons , which were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting have been summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health who had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board will not be delivered , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco @-@ management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; the group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of most of the products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC to place public @-@ law programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that for six years he tried to get in touch with BBC in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communication committee in the context of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I think medium or long @-@ term is not a good idea , you should at least on programs that do not make or order another . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I &apos;m sorry to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was responsible for hunting reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggest@@ ing that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ er@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one cannot measure the public , but they can argue if they are going to justify their seem@@ ing missions of £ 4 billion , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programmes that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the radio fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all , we all think that one receives a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also announced before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check , &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission . &quot;
&quot; he said that only a few of BBC &apos;s production would officially be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should , for example , take up an example of this change in public @-@ law TV stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels of alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulse .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed for the human hearing to high frequencies in order to be heard .
the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which enter into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels , and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically genetically modified the worms to carry some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when they turn ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of the light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; unlike light that has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and underground trains and that require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : from September 15th to 18th with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) , you read in the font types of London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into a picture of a tank . &quot;
&quot; in September , a flock of weapons dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the weapons show . &quot;
the 300 posters are artists who have exhibited their work in the museum for cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
&quot; a collective named Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; ad space h@@ ack packs , &quot; a £ 6 @-@ pack of Allen keys , claimed that &quot; access to around one @-@ third of bus stops can gain access to the planet . &quot;

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned all around advertising for the weapons fair - by a legend of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid .
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ic company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ rint with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
&quot; perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors will dev@@ ote fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dwell@@ ings
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgetting 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the arrival in student dwell@@ ings ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ Year , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often transform themselves into drinks recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also the places where people dress themselves and their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not think about starting the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receives a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ walk @-@ culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go forward , but you must go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you a bit baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ings .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my floor asked her neighbors , if she would make something quiet , drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted on this with even more lu@@ st@@ ful music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , stop them , separate themselves and see them every day and perhaps experience how they all come across all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow @-@ resident is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ belly a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his key in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place through hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but don &apos;t forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ers your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ se@@ ater , Ger@@ ing@@ scor@@ er &quot;
the property company Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental Rei@@ h@@ enburg for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; thus for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the only mother and the needy . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how rapidly favorable living space can be created : it builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the stream of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : there is least room for a terra@@ ced house .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if you teach people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seekers .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be adapted easily according to the needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is worth 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
are building provisions complicated to their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have done my project correctly .
&quot; in particular , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the position regulation ordin@@ ance . &quot;
gr@@ un@@ chy .
&quot; it is still under@@ stated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were , which accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built up luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ erer . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how you can build cheap and good today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
some have encountered problems after the installation because they get an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack goes back or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by merging the update . likewise , it will be easier to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued since the phone may be hal@@ ted halfway and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;

N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes team @-@ mates Lewis Hamilton just a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Second emphasized before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot;
53 Points separate the Vice @-@ World Champion before the descend@@ ant in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve rounds of the season and also took the Fl@@ ut@@ licht Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Br@@ ite was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an influence on Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .
&quot; since days , a Dun@@ st@@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighboring island Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to his ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1 . class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation which President Alfred Klein accepted .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players that cannot afford the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; as an expression of its connection with the spa town is seen .

Sal@@ u@@ dis and Anton@@ isti@@ ft Alten@@ zentrum joined together under the man@@ hood of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation moves it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as care insurance or services for health and nursing homes . &quot;
for years we have been using our ambul@@ ant care service that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently many services are not used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new master in Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ istics and civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care courses and wellness . &quot;
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken with the boat .
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior care centre for care and care , &quot; explained Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both business leaders see particularly demographic change . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure is essential in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular con@@ vivi@@ al presence . &quot;
&quot; with this , the Social Foundation makes a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ san office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 . &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed down 92 years old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus opened on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus left an honorary member and &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was mentioned in the broadcast . &quot;
&quot; born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men was crying out to the young people , and struck this man &apos;s face . &quot;
the victim suffered a nose of nose and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he left his victim first . &quot;
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to the apartment , and there demonstr@@ atively passed several times . &quot;
&quot; when you couldn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the last one before the building went to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the bat and another male .
&quot; under the aid of a stroke , the victim &apos;s face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim were tested . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too is present . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 m tall .
the second ra@@ cket is supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a den@@ im and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still half part of his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus@@ ens years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently does their medical education at the Ver@@ den hospital and will also want to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , followed by his medical studies in Hanover , followed by several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a Senior Physi@@ cian in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is honorary member of the D@@ RK @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19th , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to be settled as domestic doctors . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ load EC@@ Gs and need more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the rub@@ b@@ ish ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) will receive a supplement of 50,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ son &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the practice field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , those who visit mil@@ ler &apos;s consul@@ ts look also above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ steh@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends with their departure , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly . &quot;
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could become different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Home Affairs , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum application can &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; also . &quot;
the provision and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish corri@@ dors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia rather intensi@@ fies the monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary - to intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians will not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night @-@ hours of Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , in order to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it mainly concerns Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country has some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to do so , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived at the Serbian border town S@@ id , in the course of the day additional buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been travelling the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border from Serbia around 500 kilometers away throughout the night .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said to us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could actually be a little further west on the road . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; extensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible withdrawal situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners since then face a good report on the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm down the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border now closed .
&quot; at present , it would not be about very high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
workers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of gaining insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der shops should have been made to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators reported a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the processes against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the USA and Eastern Europe .
&quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid , Mannheim , has been in existence for 20 years &quot;
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their concerns , sometimes fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortable stro@@ lling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep urban railways .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with stunning autumn sunlight and middle of it four large boards each with the title &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot;
&quot; the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid , with this action , drew attention to its 20 years of existence and is faced with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available for questions and talks as well as the volunteers .
&quot; while some people take a fit spontaneously to the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; ride my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; I am not yet &quot; &quot; and go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end is coming to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic Works Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables , however , may be understandable , after all it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still adher@@ ed to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people . &quot;
an app@@ rais@@ al that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; faced with personal experiences with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid , by calling honorary official , she immediately reported and had been involved in the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid is able to deal well with its task and the experience and experience gained .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , consider it precious and precious , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further education and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning companions .
all two years are offered training sessions for new employees .
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ handling service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for holiday periods . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than the previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was nonetheless expected that the result was increased compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; the company yields solid earnings if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted by the twelve analysts asked by Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
&quot; for analysts , six of the analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to the station . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table in order to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; im@@ pending over them at an end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey sitting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices to remain stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the most cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which betra@@ ys itself to the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a increase in interest rates this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets , however , anticipate a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the strike by promising a further increase . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is holding the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; she would have to go far in her explanation to calm down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would so@@ ot@@ he financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence would be expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed envis@@ ages full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed @-@ representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial Goo@@ ds accounted for more than 16 % among its maximum , as investors were afraid that the Chinese economy slow@@ ed down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , with the Dow now almost 10 % below May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn &apos;t occurred in the past few weeks , they would put on the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should be technically not involved in making decisions . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority of the world has become . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; close up &quot; their monetary expansion , spark@@ ed confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that are not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
&quot; painted , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who sets up for an interest rate increase , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to cut its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite the limited apparent impact on the US growth , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed @-@ representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability to the first place in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an interest in interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / bearing was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , he is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / bearing is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the g@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the coff@@ ers and has different taking options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably did .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish the@@ ke - the staff behind the bar will clean and filter the fish and even roast them on request for you . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
&quot; giving you a warm welcome , is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ness asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still happy with her 74 lic@@ ences .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very different lesson than at a real school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women about how important good food is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies , who are su@@ cking to breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ table construction at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest community meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to this , the committee also decided to submit an application for a &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from a legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof top &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants is the planned use of the roof surface : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which , for energy reasons - was prescribed differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of the development plan no &quot; exceptions &quot; was permissible - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at usually dec@@ ei@@ ves more restric@@ tively in the case of freedom of liberation . &quot;
&quot; in turn , however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ promotion .
&quot; in the next step of the process , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be presented to the Coun@@ cill@@ or for Ex@@ am@@ ination . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this was confirmed by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this took place on the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would be employed . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees , who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who agreed to take over the leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; upgrading &quot; and a dis@@ semination of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; range , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
&quot; over the next two years , when the Supervisory Board agrees with the Supervisory Board , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves both of them , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ie , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ betra@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ liga , will now be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there were several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily esp@@ it@@ at@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who has been &quot; positive and understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was constantly threatened by closing in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called today evening ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but nobody exists . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ener moved into a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and made something good there . &quot;
hunting trip with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police shared . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was initially unclear . &quot;
the crimin@@ al@@ poli@@ z@@ ei as@@ cer@@ tained .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
&quot; a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old killed the young people and threw their corp@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 year old man from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , has fallen victim to a violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a suspect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also arrested on Tuesday evening , also claimed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the corp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 year old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived at home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , as agreed . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met with the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed the authorities and put the bodies in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him down . &quot;
the further investigation is to bring about the closer circumstances .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against mosquito dwell@@ ings
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er residential construction &quot; &quot; debate . &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ time accommodation . &quot;
many come across the housing market and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have stayed in the last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only attributable to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable failures in the housing development of recent years .
&quot; Germany is shooting a residential deficit , which is increasing from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently about 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , many working persons were forced to stay in large cities in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed un@@ willingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the dol@@ drums on the housing market .
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has fallen again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; thus , the tax on the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee housing of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the € 300 million had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free rein : Croatia and Slovenia direct corri@@ dors
&quot; after Hungary , there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees are choosing their way through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous nonetheless . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees fled to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik border , reported to the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day are virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the majority of media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t run on border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s . &quot;
&quot; now , mine clear@@ ances are to quickly create a secure passage . &quot;
&quot; in Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closing date on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been received on Tuesday in the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; &quot; ( Trans@@ itz@@ ons ) in a total of 94 applications , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees had stopped there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has a view to receive asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot;
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left the road@@ side in recent weeks .
lat@@ ti@@ ces were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border place was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; however , around 20,000 migrants still settled in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , approximately 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge on Sunday , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had un@@ expect@@ edly set rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ ted the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the near Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we first su@@ ed the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said right now , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to pass a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , in order to try it after the short notice that the railway was stopped in Germany , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was turned off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a double brid@@ le run spor@@ adi@@ cally - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures to help ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has highly officially and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not just those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof districts &quot;
&quot; with the spreading of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the First Inst@@ ance Centre , Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , has already gotten a grip on Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he said of his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday was without great vor@@ tex , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; championship performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , some 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already had talks with the national govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born who will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; the asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ gings must adhere to a certain height of the towel holder or size of the upper requirements . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he founded Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , our own quest search has not been successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for refugees planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment because people are currently unable to take these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suitability . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has corrupted the further action in the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; however , the protective searches would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , Austria is now a logical consequence of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general restoration of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is set in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup firms of the New Shi@@ py@@ ard , and later to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; already from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is viewed from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 m ² remaining area in the building has already been rented , for a further 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now received growth in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags made by Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; but I thought for a long time , if I should open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest Br@@ eit got into the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I feel the most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why some woman , when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the specialist with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called the gi@@ ver .
this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ ups .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia , re@@ porters or reports of gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office spark@@ s the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well with it .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a term many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting , but they are not so impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to which beside Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high German : the gi@@ ants , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ger .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
foundations of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , which belonged to the Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once ch@@ ewed without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared on the start of the film . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as he pol@@ ishes , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , &quot; the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz donated a little for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they found it better if he did not win the election , because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the Sa@@ gen at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , also in the US aw@@ akes interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first clim@@ ber village .
&quot; from the hand of vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ resident @-@ village in the National Park of Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den was awarded the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the down@@ fall seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to the today &apos;s 3@@ 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at today &apos;s 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial stone from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and easily struck The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half @-@ hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine feel confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will finally prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars which failed to flood the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agrees : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly seem unknow@@ ingly who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , finally landing in The Bachelor &apos;s degree in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girl will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you might acci@@ dentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed up to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have argued in a ly@@ rical way about why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; her answers could become the game of the game who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly named both - besides himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams Energi@@ es noticed , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was quite compatible throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be good as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood &quot; &quot; could be One . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now shut down on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game while he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League convert at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the changing cub@@ icle after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ nes publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first play@@ quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field and later told the Australian radio pairing Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , just to take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ nes said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut back in 2007 when a pass led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was still a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , the party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters was conven@@ ing until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is to over@@ lay the retreat , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the Nazi war in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s no longer , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; that &apos;s why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent , &quot; &quot; We need uniform standards of federal states in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria res@@ ig@@ ns , others do not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Kul@@ tus@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started the pilot study &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; , &quot; with an extension of the secondary high school of three to four years . &quot;
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W leader . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high school students who want to .
free transfer to the G@@ 9 wherever you want .

many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect that the markets will be in place until after the interest rate decision in the United States and also to the large decline in the deadline on this Friday .
the discussion about the loads from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep traces at E@@ on .

4 people killed after police fired on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot rubber in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ se district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , General District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before taking back rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber floors used , known for being able to kill but traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ y who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very con@@ ten@@ tious issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a plot of around 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Alte Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
you are waiting for appropriate offers on the part of the city .
which investor may come into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts had been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , bought already a few months ago and the buildings located on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the Holi@@ day@@ flat at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .

&quot; for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , gro@@ oved , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press Company &quot; System Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called for the pictures and new details of the hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and the board member at the lob@@ b@@ ying of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this will be a giant cla@@ ws overlooking all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , like several other project critics , he fears that the traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; all bus@@ loads must come in order for this to be calculated , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is exactly on the well @-@ sized site of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the construction plans were still variable . &quot;

Google launches dual donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ f. O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to bring about $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking desper@@ ately for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million were doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also escaped from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

&quot; for easily overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations to treat type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I below those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes was dissolved completely only by one percent and in part with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , writing the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how you reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , such as Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that leads surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was in case of obes@@ e people who undergo an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people interested in a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently being noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so even in the recently published novel , &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main @-@ career author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama said that Europe could not take up all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader appe@@ aled to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of ing@@ es@@ of@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the US report about 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ lows strongly alcoholic hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , thus Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the incidence of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more of these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube how to drink adolescents dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
&quot; especially in infants , few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 channel in Kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ key , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry du@@ cks in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered to be drunk in an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated it at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , since the girl fell through the alcohol and had met her head , Rit@@ chie said . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store tra@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities staff suggest that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to tra@@ des@@ infection agents and ban@@ ishes them out of their space .
the police looked at the ver@@ ei@@ tel@@ ed plan as a &quot; squ@@ ir@@ rel &quot; and gave disciplinary measures to the school authority .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates did not stand under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dut@@ ch@@ men - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers there . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show any highlights of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here speak not just about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they speak about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which is now clear with five points , clearly stood at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel exactly this way - but we must continue .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window .
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
Schot@@ t@@ lands &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the UK@@ s as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ es with the procedure

why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already invited for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media pitches from 12 to five .
who is selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
&quot; I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she could have formulated it better , but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria , claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk around the main , and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m trying to do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers . &quot;
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I am going to name when asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in the attempt to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L , and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today . &quot;
should I consider this to be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L be cow@@ ard@@ ly acting and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought of . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the coach have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching gave him that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known through his preparation of the un@@ slaugh@@ tered Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the &quot; &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; progression after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the hor@@ sem@@ an , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my staff has mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
it would have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; it would have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it also had it that way on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver flight arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a clas@@ h with a cycl@@ ist and driver flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .
the police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police took place in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be charged with driver assistance and under@@ las@@ h@@ ed assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy cr@@ ushes against ri@@ vals for claims about ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators allowed the storm @-@ players &quot; ring @-@ fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his crew had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; model example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended his team &apos;s t@@ ack@@ iness and said that they were only concentrating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team ass@@ ures him confi@@ dently , because they were worried they were worried about being beaten by the storm team . &quot;
&quot; this time and again , I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring @-@ fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . &quot;
it is funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his play on Saturday evening with ours on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of himself . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , or are not anything exciting ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team released this weekend , because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; serving with 200,000 $ deposit on drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who possibly threat@@ ens a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Bundes@@ poli@@ z@@ ei met 100 kg of the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America on Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly lifel@@ ong penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café might have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of the danger of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars together as security in order to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ ection@@ ate statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a $ 200,000 security is a real financial burden , &quot; Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan said . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on security deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport and reports to the police daily , holding an exit lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driving House spl@@ its apart
&quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to leave the last moment to the left as the police hur@@ ried .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident engineer tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al und Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 pm .
&quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ lia to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the ma@@ iden &apos;s phone as this fell into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a series of un@@ steady images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he had done it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ lia on the Internet &quot; &quot; and he then said , to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction , that he might be addic@@ ted to frigh@@ tening people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , said however , it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are up ped@@ ophi@@ lia . &quot;
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more pictures .
he said he did so to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he was drinking , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and weeping . &quot;
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the charges of in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before the court on 24 March this year . &quot;
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg is not appearing in the register of sexual offen@@ ders because one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted deposit , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of judgment to the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zers avoid small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left for fear of discovery and arrest the people more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were walking over bridges and con@@ ges@@ tion on the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich Central Station , a lot more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station in comparison to the week of the week . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn against squ@@ alls in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low is the footh@@ old of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; drawn over the Atlantic Ocean in the past few days . &quot;
fierce storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the bottom @-@ sea @-@ circle with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 kilometres long . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun rose again for a longer time . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the cars show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly a movement in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Power ( KBA ) alone in August alone on this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence March 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and the new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer other diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , to which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will drive up on new compact cars in addition to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan publisher wants to find its position in the growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hor@@ se@@ power . &quot;
&quot; the maximum torque is , according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions , with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er laid hands on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the upcoming Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has been right for an ex @-@ prisoner of the justice system Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation when they are housed in too small cells . &quot;
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court decided in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were confined within a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel judicial institute between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his law , was now on free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his detention condition failed because of the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the country in Berlin .
&quot; however , the judges of the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and returned the case for re @-@ examination . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s human dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court therefore decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot; &quot;
chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money damage .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of punishment . &quot;
thus they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell .
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy of the decision of 2011 . &quot;
&quot; additionally on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had att@@ ested to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for more than three months , the former pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommodated between 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also entered the head@@ lines due to lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours again , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to massac@@ res it is supposed to have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ amt , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the forecasts of the Federal Interior Ministry this year , approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are to come to Germany , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is capable of absor@@ bing a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : 60,000 up to 80@@ ,000 social housing estates are issued from the rent for rent a year , and refugees will also apply to these particularly favorable apartments . &quot;
&quot; Bundes@@ bau@@ minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is from the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80@@ ,000 social housing would have to be produced and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion annually . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and Federal Minister of Building Council agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute for Employment Research ( IAB ) estimates , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the sense of admission , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , in Germany , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligatory obligation to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , it has mostly prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and job @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often are medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; the structure of networks therefore , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , is the royal road to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of the German language will be prepared for education . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal country prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
student willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or tolerance do not receive any services after the asylum application law , if they begin their studies . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the bear@@ ded persons . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from January 1 , 2016 , this span is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also this financing gap needs to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and , for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essively gradually clean up the same rights as the churches , and develop the existing state churches right to a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; also important would be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him some control options . &quot;
this also involves the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the entire society in the future .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Gender E@@ quality Act for a decade .
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants and interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and are committed to international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention in Germany must become a reality in the coming years , if the country should remain peaceful and use its new citizens for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the refugees expected to date , says Doctor &apos;s President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to hand to all newcom@@ ers as soon as they register health cards . &quot;
services rendered could later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people as possible with the limited achievement catalog , which the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , doctors especially make language barriers . &quot;
&quot; as far as so far , Berlin &apos;s Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be ill @-@ reli@@ ed on its diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general emergency ambul@@ ances in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among the refugee children , for example , there are considerably more un@@ attended han@@ di@@ caps , and in the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with some of the other diseases of the disease , German doctors came from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to identify . &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a highly developed education system , several refugees were even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from the so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ra@@ mps and fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sho@@ el@@ essness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent symptoms to be chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can ask for a psych@@ otherapy application in the social offices , however , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , temporary workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would also decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ estimates , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst covers the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of intrigu@@ ing ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst loads into the arena on a brick v@@ ases to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto stands the current stage of man@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift for lovers is the family in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to bring the people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; said the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world @-@ city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometer long tour can experience this flair .
the circus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded by the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to take up the cub@@ an duo . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with the sense of dex@@ ter@@ ity and arti@@ san@@ ity . &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little as others and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
conflicts in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the top command : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with our whole heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family day , the prices are reduced by 5 pm . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , the oldest guide in Africa , fell down the stairs by a podium in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also encouraged by asser@@ tions of opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
&quot; last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he said after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the restructuring and savings efforts of the company &apos;s services .
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected reduction of jobs leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and profound portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has over $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ available , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a statement by the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has undergone massive restructuring to handle the departure of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , which is based on the belief that closely focused companies can perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and where his rehabilitation follows plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most injuries .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury quot@@ a will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need to take a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal is clear favor@@ ites to come up with Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and is driven by the far @-@ away hope to lead the association with its management to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in the arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in store to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally sound friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the nice thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football gu@@ sts in cozy arm@@ chairs and the cra@@ ving of Ross after Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often with@@ hold to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y care told me : ... &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ ici@@ dal , has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest to visit the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement in the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ ses@@ pi@@ el from Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris @-@ Team after his injury , which was held on the weekend a 2 : 2 in his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and joined a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field bor@@ rows a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did not offer anything in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ sile and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was abandoned in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he put his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an recorded his sixth seasonal gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low , before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognized by the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then we only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hats off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers $ 2.5 billion by stock sales
&quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is hit by temporary commodity prices in Switzerland , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge school identification plan . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and affects markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the $ 2.5 billion stock sales last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion in debt .
&quot; the company sold the new equity hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have declined by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , will take place on September 25 and returns President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; this evening , the US President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State @-@ D@@ iner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President Bush &apos;s visit will be an opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time also President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before he travels to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ es@@ ying China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played at that time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winner , two time champi@@ ons champion , two time champi@@ ons champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing out of Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also of the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM .
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; with that he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ final of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the lawn , the reds switched off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it with the occupation of the film and not at the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &quot; Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck &quot; and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nun , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something , which we do not want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on , talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after having killed Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves movement achieved national impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still@@ ness , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation and , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is not clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports climbing and control aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition @-@ show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the final task was climbing on a 75 foot long rope climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s winning any res@@ ent@@ ment .
he is just so happy to have what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for A@@ chte Staff@@ el , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , however , this part played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in 1 / 3 interior and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen every game , and so I really want to go into the game . &quot;
&quot; the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit @-@ hit game ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he sw@@ ung well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the 7th of Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designed R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who tore a two @-@ run off the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League , the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth interior , Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three points for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited from a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es to the start of the game .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three of us in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled from the injury list in front of the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving first the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not very well beaten , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , did not scored points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z expi@@ red because of an injury of the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list because of a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is cancelled by the vulner@@ ability list in order to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he has been purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 &quot;
he has been missing from the right hip since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are supposed to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the most excited people will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden communic@@ ates on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; for the first time in the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen for the first time . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the thinking about military action must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he proposed the European states to &quot; look at a collective direction . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military presence in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again implemented controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
the Austrian Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement according to which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call it and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria on the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the League wants to support the countries in the initial recording and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced at the end of Tuesday evening after nearly four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection , compla@@ ins of it too . &quot;
&quot; but those who do not have a lead @-@ perspective , can also not stay in Germany . &quot;
this view had been strongly divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking identification of cre@@ ators from Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; meanwhile , there were thousands of further migrants in Turkey on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
beneath the ice @-@ tail of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean flo@@ ats .
this includes researchers from observations of space son@@ de &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring plan@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; although it is only small but still too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade journal .
already longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed . &quot;
&quot; the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce about a month at an offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
&quot; in the case of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , an investigation carried out an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich lions , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to mean four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to pon@@ der now , &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot;
&quot; however , the six@@ ties presented a defensive patron as training guest . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously signed by the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the possibility of proving its ability . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his bra@@ ins shock , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to enter the running training . &quot;
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a violent clas@@ h on the head . &quot;
&quot; but contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious ir@@ ony . &quot;
no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy .
&quot; but he who wishes to pay attention to his lean line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because Man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are nevertheless healthy : in them contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. First of all , Man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; whoever eats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the shell color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so green man@@ gos can taste delicious . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
but a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf teas like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; for the Christmas business in the United States , the US parcel service U@@ PS will again provide up to 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot;
&quot; the company has already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS delivered on Tuesday . &quot;
drivers are looked for above all .
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex began preparations for Christmas business last year . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had submitted a harsh criticism for package services . &quot;
&quot; first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn breaks out in the valleys of the F@@ öhn , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night of Thursday , the F@@ öhn winds partly with storm strength through the gro@@ o@@ ving valleys . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong rainf@@ all , wind @-@ bu@@ ds and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of a comprehensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the alpine side , the F@@ öhn breaks through the valleys on the night . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the f@@ ables with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn can advance in some places to the adjoining centre and on the mountains , even or@@ ic@@ ar@@ cs of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , a tum@@ ul@@ tuous hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the mountain hut begins to st@@ ow . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in sum , in the next 48 hours , some 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps , this after already large amounts of rainf@@ all have already fallen in the last days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the air escap@@ es , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strongly until stor@@ my and the temperatures go far back . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , however , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
&quot; just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; he is now known as the &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the Pop@@ es of the Pop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; with the place , it becomes symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) found himself as a young August@@ inian monks around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a corrupt s@@ ini@@ ster ba@@ bel .
&quot; his negative impressions , according to historians , should have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the departure trade .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not the Ot@@ mar Alt Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that focus on themes such as cross @-@ way , pla@@ gues , commandments or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; this means he has fascinated several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag , with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , in current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; since the education happened already with the cane stock , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work out that , in order to be able to re@@ strain myself again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to bring art back to greater importance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; , &quot; discover , discover , and sense what power they have : &quot; the picture looks for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt Bible in the Ot@@ mar Alt Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he mat@@ ures life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old didn &apos;t take care of recording the Bible completely , but selected the most important ones for him as well as mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; a picture bi@@ ble was created . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar Alt Foundation on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X train close
&quot; plans made , place found , companies t@@ asked to model Earth &apos;s hills for a round trip : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was already finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured confusion , especially among residents who would not tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill stop@@ ed up , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be received in October , the first joint venture Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further memorial break &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football responds to the situation to be seen in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in principle nobody can say that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in getting a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Ms. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and may help .
&quot; the decisive turn@@ out , however , must put politics . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already at this weekend , the 36 professional associations will show a clear sign if they will be carried on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) , &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everybody , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; we can play football , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;

Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had launched their own projects would be great .
equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the Federal Government , provides 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses one eye in case of accident
&quot; the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the accident on the staircase in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then tow@@ ed out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if one has fallen down . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : female in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund everybody hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga also in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be present on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the heavy burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his ancestors &apos; position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
thus he announced a change on the position of the door@@ keeper .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of ancest@@ ry Roman citizen . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ging statement by Mit@@ er R@@ eus , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers mid@@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehensible : &quot; thus , Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot Au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the transformation of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; the automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; says Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio broadcasting . &quot;
&quot; for the testing of new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; not be br@@ ushed aside any additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more of the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 is technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot;
&quot; however , the German driving cars still see themselves skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , a survey carried out by For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of Prü@@ for@@ gan@@ isation Dek@@ ra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be able to prevail over the next ten years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States accounts for 33 percent . &quot;
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the whole trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way , the traffic could be at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would not leave the car in control under any circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;

&quot; at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsor in China . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which thanks to video projections sc@@ ary human look . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , it is now real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From Bürger@@ stei@@ g to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his stance to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; in fact he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ there@@ . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was done : to fr@@ at@@ ori@@ ze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially engaged . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , 14 tons of material , the makers have car@@ rt according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , fragile fashion attempts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he had dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught himself the dis@@ car@@ ding of fashion .
he ste@@ ered fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier said in Munich .
&quot; but later , I bought them , of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he won &apos;t be able to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that le@@ ases to past stal@@ ks is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
private trade shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer there .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are produced in the Asian region much cheaper and sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; also weak@@ ening export , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally friendly and socially compatible products . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ Saxony University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often only varies slightly to hold a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historical snow@@ ball peak . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres at some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s masterpiece , Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach K@@ rau@@ ße , was inspired by this : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t start with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener lace - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the United States , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to share a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as modern ambass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney turns into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a re @-@ film , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the global economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI insi@@ sts on opening the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy has to open wide towards the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was charged with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should try to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the provision of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , the promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and businesses that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it points to the market a major role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a right @-@ to @-@ law business environment and stream@@ lines the market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers committed to the companies and make sure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China &apos;s border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; within the scope of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to make the consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding workplace of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants &quot; , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish in the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ ett@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p usually are so low , that they are still keeping track of the planned maximum values . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in cl@@ one is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that alone the economy helps , &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal for the human being rich in predat@@ ory fish above all in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; already small amounts can , especially in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system , &quot; can cause . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values but that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury enters the environment above all due to coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants will come up with more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
