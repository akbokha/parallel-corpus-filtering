the purpose of this part of the Convention is to set up procedures as required for the implementation of the conditions of the part I .
the aim of the method of securing measures defined in this Convention is the timely identification of the removal of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a removal by the risk of early discovery .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material volume does not refer to the specified amount of material for a certain period of time , excluding the accuracy limits specified for the specified periods .
in the implementation of its veri@@ fications , the organisation will make an article 3 full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their securing measures , the Community of de Proc@@ esses and measures will make use of the following kinds of use and they , as far as necessary , see how they are intended to be near@@ er and practical in the comple@@ mentary agreements .
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of retained , manufactured , lost , lost or in other way from the inventory removed core material and inventory ;

on the basis of the initial report , the organization represents a summar@@ ised inventory list of the total , the securing measures of this Convention underlying nuclear material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory list due to the following reports and the results of their veri@@ fications .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help the immediate need of individual countries with low income whose development is ob@@ struct@@ ed by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ric problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire member of the Member States is bound up within six months following entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loan , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have cons@@ ented to each other through the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has submitted a table from which it is apparent in which it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; Special tionary account &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to by the Organisation as administrator of tre@@ u@@ sia and uses ( in this property , the organisation is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment takes place in the form of cash or un@@ expect@@ edly deb@@ ated deb@@ ts of the Member State , which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state in order to pay by the organisation as administrator of the special transaction accounts and depos@@ ited at the place of the organisation in the country concerned .
B ) The payment takes place in two rates , and i ) the first amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administrator agreed at the time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rema@@ inder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one Member State may make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates upon request .
the car@@ et@@ aker commen@@ ces in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization about proportional drawing on the cash or the school system to cover expenses for the special transaction and to compens@@ ate the special transaction account in a reasonable manner .
in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the administrator can deri@@ ve the following factors in accordance with the requirements of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned may be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special ac@@ ron@@ ym is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly paid development programme or hab@@ it ( including a sect@@ orial hab@@ it ) , regardless of whether it is considered to be a loan program of the organisation or not , according to the procedures and practices required for the purpose of the organisation financed by the Organization .
the funds of the special shareholders may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organisation which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization in the context of a loan or loan .
apart from Section 4 , special respon@@ dents are subject to the same return payment conditions , which are generally valid for the organisation of the organisation and are therefore ref@@ und@@ able for ten years in 50 years .
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
the amounts for payment of this enco@@ der are directly to the organization they retain .
any special loan is given by a separate loan agreement between the contra@@ cting country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the means .
the income from each special transaction can be used for spending in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or produced in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and those that the administrator has set up at the time of the loan granted , recipients of a special act .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special shareholders are carried out on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this manner in the currency of a member state , is to return as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
the administrator has submitted to the E@@ EC until the full publication of all the special shareholders in preparation and on the plans and programs approved by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special transaction , the administrator has noti@@ fied the E@@ EC as a quarter of the development of the special respon@@ dent and the expenses for this purpose .
the administrator , as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization , sent a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation to this account .
after full payment of the special transaction , the administrator of the E@@ EC will soon be sent as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and calculations from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which came out of account recei@@ v@@ ables , paid to the account and from the account paid to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the administrator work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the complete issue of the funds of the Special tionary account , the continuation of the programmes of the special shareholders , the continuation of the programmes or plans , and on any other questions related to the provisions of this Agreement .

the agreement could be closed to the mechanism paid by the cre@@ dit@@ ation country to the mechanism paid by the cre@@ dit@@ ors , and within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion b@@ illing Units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery dead@@ lines of member countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , however , here are some conditions called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BI@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would first assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extension orders , without having to be exceeded for a total of five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the opening of loans , as well as with its temporary extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a loan commission commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draw would be made in the BI@@ Z at the conclusion of the agreement at the disposal of the currencies , very likely in US dollars ; they would cover up to periods that would be based on account of the funds of the bank , estimated to be three or six months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z used at the respective time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BIS has to obtain the necessary funds for itself on the market , the interest rate could achieve a maximum , which corresponds to the corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor .

in recognition of the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the export of Hamm@@ el - and lam@@ b meat after the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured that the normal ship@@ ments of new New Zealand Hamm@@ el and lam@@ b meat will not be imp@@ aired on these markets , I must propose to propose the following agreements :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lam@@ b and go@@ at meat ( 02.0@@ 1 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement , New Zealand for Hamm@@ el - , lam@@ b - and go@@ ats of access to the market of the community in the agreement will be ensured .
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal ship@@ ments of his Hamm@@ el - and lam@@ b flesh does not be dra@@ gged through the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the set @-@ up amount does not exceed the specified amount .
the specified quantities are performed in conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community as@@ sures that New Zealand with this agreement should not be prevented from using new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community .
should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade possible , the two contra@@ cting parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in cl@@ ause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
for the event that the community accepts the protection cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement .
for the event that imports from New Zealand exce@@ eds the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to exp@@ ose the imports from this country .

a reag@@ ent for blood group determination must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ ol@@ og the anti@@ body or another on the label .
if a reag@@ ent is used by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ äm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the titanium is measured by constantly renewed di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent on the double in a suitable medium .
the Tit@@ ans is the prime value of the most powerful ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the dil@@ ation is calculated exclusively by the volume of the blood cells flow in the total volume .
in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are to be used on object racks , activity is expressed through time that is required for ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the blood group determination international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other species , standards are being developed .
an international standard preparation contains according to definition a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ters , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flow .
the titanium contains the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture in a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ gl@@ ut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination used for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( at present Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as In@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) can be expressed in accordance with the International standard preparation or state standardis@@ ation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you restore it to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ight contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are free of the international laboratory for biological standards of World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen , available .

the exp@@ iry date for dry reag@@ ents is based on the results of holding tests ; it is appro@@ achable by state super@@ visory authorities .
dry @-@ reag@@ ents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate .
a dry @-@ reaction may lose at most 0.5 b.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by more dr@@ um@@ mers via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide in a pressure of no more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacteria growth , the competent authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or with the dry reag@@ ents supplied ) is added to anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or anti@@ biotic , as long as the reag@@ ent with the added substance remains the prerequis@@ ites for specific@@ ity and effic@@ acy .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein powder per ml fluid or re @-@ dis@@ solved ser@@ um .
the reag@@ ents , equally valid , whether in a flu@@ ffy form or after re @-@ release , must be transparent and may not contain se@@ di@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the reag@@ ent in a tank does not only suff@@ ice to perform tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity required in a container must be so great that the contents may be used to perform the effic@@ acy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory laboratory has written written records on all levels of production and controls of reag@@ ents .
appropriate samples of all issued reag@@ ents must be kept as long as the laboratory to store until with some lik@@ eli@@ hood that the Charge is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to rein@@ force the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or plant reag@@ ents can contain no substances of human origin .

protocol to the Convention of 1979 over the dre@@ amy limit@@ ing air pollution caused by the elim@@ ination of nitrogen oxi@@ des or the limit@@ ing river
worried about that the current emissions of air poll@@ uted substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America are causing damage to natural value for the environment and the economy ,
meanwhile , the Executive Board of the Convention on its second session has recognised the need to effectively reduce the annual total greenhouse gas oxi@@ des from location @-@ resistant and mo@@ vable sources or its limit@@ ing flow to 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , maintaining and vali@@ date emissions limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des .
taking into account existing scientific and technical data about emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their subsequent products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions ,
determined to sei@@ ze effective measures to combat and reduce annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gren@@ adi@@ ers , especially by applying suitable national emission limits for new mo@@ vable type of stationary sources and by retro@@ fitting of existing greater variety of stationary sources ,
in the knowledge that the scientific and technical knowledge about these questions will evol@@ ve and that this development must be taken into account when checking the application of this protocol and the decision on further measures .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recognition that the regulatory verification of procedures for the creation of more favorable conditions for a technology exchange will contribute to an effective reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the European Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with satisfaction to know that several states have mut@@ ually agreed to reduce their annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des and to decrease in a considerable extent ,
the measures taken by some states have already caused a reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des .
