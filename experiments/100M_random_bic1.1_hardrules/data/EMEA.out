B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ an@@ ity ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disease , in which the patient &apos;s epis@@ odes ( periods of anor@@ agra@@ ms ) altern@@ ately altern@@ ately with periods of normal atmosphere .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and prevention of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid monitoring of stressed un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used or the mel@@ ting tablets in patients can be used to treat the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are using other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is pres@@ um@@ ably used as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contains such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ at@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recep@@ tors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , whereby psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms will be reduced and their recovery is prevented .
the effic@@ acy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the occurr@@ ence of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the effic@@ acy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases caused by increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effic@@ acy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that re@@ acts to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
effic@@ acy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared with 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo for a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients treated to the treatment was investigated .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ ates the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in dos@@ es of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy prevented also up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo for recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients and if it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg dos@@ es also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled access ) , ac@@ ath@@ ic ( lack of movement ) , head@@ ache , bl@@ urred vision , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy during the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ heavy to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol talked about the risks .
in addition , the committee also came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of stressed un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ wei@@ gh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . approval for the in@@ convenience of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and their man@@ ic epis@@ odes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effic@@ acy of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
effic@@ acy of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dosage ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of abnormal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after replacement of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of disease associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic symptoms .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which are pre@@ dispos@@ able for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hy@@ post@@ asis , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dys@@ function during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in case with A@@ bili@@ fy treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be dra@@ gged to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be set .
this is why Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states that are associated with sei@@ zu@@ res in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients had treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with cad@@ mium or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk estimates for hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications .
the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other central drug effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ des , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhib@@ itor ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ oren of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es can result in higher plasma concent@@ rations of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma concent@@ rations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ oren with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefit to out@@ wei@@ gh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ oren of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ emia , should have similar effects and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
after removing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be lifted to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administ@@ ered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be calculated with an even increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concent@@ rations .
in clinical trials , dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( Dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ amine ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequate data situation on the subject of safety in humans and due to the concerns associated with the animal , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the f@@ etus .
however , as also with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative impact on them .
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of eps including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ic , d@@ yst@@ onie and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.4 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 19 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with glossy ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of eps 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of eps 18.@@ 2 % was for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of the C@@ PK ( cre@@ atine phase kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
to the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zu@@ res , unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market introduction , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were observed in adult patients with estimated dos@@ es of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there are no information on the effic@@ acy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose is beneficial because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma rotation .
the effic@@ acy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and an excessive aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
in the case of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a daily dose of healthy subjects showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup .
in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .

current values from measured scale , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in a glossy ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.2 kg in an average weight of ca . ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior effic@@ acy over three weeks compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior effic@@ acy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ ot@@ eric characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior effic@@ acy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also proved to be a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie like lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ ot@@ eric features , which in partially over 2 weeks did not refer to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic Ser@@ um , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior effic@@ acy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a re@@ mission against plac@@ ebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in prevention of a return to the man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies , the enzy@@ mes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
the middle elim@@ ination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in extensive met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours of &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; bad &apos; ) met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics has no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and channel @-@ balanced potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects are a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ rin@@ der @-@ tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10@@ times of the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10@@ times of the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at recommended maximum dose at the recommended maximum dose .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the pre@@ cip@@ itation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ments of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of mon@@ keys after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times of the recommended daily dose ) at recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concent@@ rations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were not more than 6 % of concent@@ rations , which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of mon@@ keys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solution .

A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the gl@@ ut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under the circum@@ stance of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into consideration the medicine used in the treatment or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a secondary treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy mel@@ amine tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on effic@@ acy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .

clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should regularly be monitored regularly regarding the deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications .
however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the inci@@ dence of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cular medication and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cular .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the observed average improvement of the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Exc@@ lusi@@ vely Comp@@ onent score was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar effic@@ acy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 @-@ 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the respon@@ dents used to talk to study medi@@ ation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scale , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ Scale scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.2 kg in an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ ot@@ eric features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed superior effic@@ acy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a re@@ mission against plac@@ ebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in prevention of a return to the man@@ ie .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ mus@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after the same dose as tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to reaching the maximum plasma levels is 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and mon@@ keys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated gift in a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cular .
in studies of re@@ productive tox@@ icity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application no safety @-@ related concerns were caused by mat@@ ern@@ al exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bit ) about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) to safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the channel ogen@@ ic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects are a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ rin@@ der @-@ tox@@ icity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ant@@ al cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of ad@@ ren@@ al car@@ cin@@ omas and combined car@@ cin@@ omas with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the pre@@ cip@@ itation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ments of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of mon@@ keys after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .

the effic@@ acy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study where 460 women participated in metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only patients who were treated for the first time because of metast@@ atic breast cancer were related to the effic@@ acy @-@ indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metast@@ atic breast cancer were related to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who bre@@ ast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic numbers in the blood .
the Medic@@ inal Committee ( CH@@ MP ) committee found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was found in patients with which the first treatment failed to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs and that it has to be given more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission approved the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to grant approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metast@@ atic disease is missing and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine content ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y during abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced in the following series to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y grade 3 , treatment may break until a improvement to degrees 1 or 2 is reached , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dos@@ es in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dos@@ es in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for in@@ suffici@@ ency and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergi@@ c reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not again be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no renewed abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes are applied again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly lab@@ eled car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity is not proven , cardi@@ ac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indic@@ ative patient are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with common antioxid@@ ants and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not practice pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age which does not practice effective contra@@ c@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply for a reliable prevention method during and up to 1 month after treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane .
the male patient treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is advised to testi@@ fy during and up to six months after treatment without a child .
male patients should be advised to consult a sperm con@@ ser@@ vation since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ rever@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can impact on traffic and the ability to serve machinery .
the following are the most common and most important cases of side effects reported in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma which were treated once every three weeks of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported with 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 789 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in the blood of heart diseases :

3 . the frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a defini@@ tive in the case in a population of 789 patients .
as these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent , which promotes the mer@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhib@@ iting their depression .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ ed the trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the framework of in vitro studies , the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved transc@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ recep@@ tor and is based on the alb@@ umin@@ binding protein SPAR@@ C ( sec@@ re@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by the data of 106 patients in two ar@@ ous@@ ed in@@ verb@@ al studies and 454 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received chemotherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for preventing an allergi@@ c reaction ( N = 225 ) or in form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 , as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
when recording in the study 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ els .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are presented below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 .
the natural process of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of abra@@ x@@ ane after 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the active ingredient ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic breast car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took place in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide @-@ ranging extra@@ v@@ ascular distribution and / or binding binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metast@@ atic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ abo@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , there are only a few data available about patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .

member states must ensure that the owner of the authori@@ zation for the in@@ verter will provide the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training publication • Summary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , eti@@ qu@@ ette and packaging line . • With clear visual representation of the correct application of the product , the correct use of the product is acci@@ dental to transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion could occur if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with ill@@ nesses for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a ble@@ eding wound , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , if they have received appropriate guidance .
patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before treatment to ensure that no iron defici@@ ency exists , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ic defici@@ ency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was administ@@ ered as an injection in a V@@ ene in the framework of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered ana@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference drug .
at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene before they were either converted to se@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for effic@@ acy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also put the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered ana@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ omy values of patients treated to se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were given an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems because other studies are needed to ensure that no allergi@@ c reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence , the drug has a comparable quality , safety and effic@@ acy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that establish@@ es Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission approved the company Medi@@ ce Drugs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to permit approval for the inf@@ rin@@ gement of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of ana@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant ly@@ mph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is given due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , ana@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron defici@@ ency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned greater operating interventions ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large el@@ ective orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure in adults without iron defici@@ ency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous bloo@@ d@@ stream programme .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ations may vary depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should be avoided for a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of ana@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance cases than patients with which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher levels of maintenance than patients with which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of ana@@ emia and subsequent appearing may vary depending on age , gender and total disease load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of ana@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number around ≥ 40@@ ,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once per week .

patients with mild ana@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ gestion is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight twice a week prior to surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitutes should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program will begin to provide large iron reserves before the beginning of the se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , once weekly about three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg must be given at 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking salt solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not be obtained or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - y@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ op@@ ie ) .
heart attacks or stroke in a month before treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile an@@ gina p@@ ect@@ or@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ al@@ tic @-@ known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ li@@ lies ) .
in patients treated for a greater el@@ ective orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or neutral ill@@ nesses : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial closure disease , v@@ ascular disease of the car@@ to@@ graphy or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; patients with recently @-@ faithful heart attacks or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease .
path@@ ophysi@@ ology ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurr@@ ence of an anti@@ body @-@ determined PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of disease defined as reduction of hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ is determined and the usual causes for non@@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 defici@@ ency , aluminium tox@@ ic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin anti@@ bodies should be determined , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin anti@@ bodies should be detected and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of se@@ amed to patients with a risk of anti@@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al ana@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 patients with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit shown to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of ana@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
it should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically proven cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ gestion in@@ suffici@@ ency should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of ana@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are still not di@@ aly@@ zed , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure .
in patients with chemotherapy should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients that need to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins should be based on a beneficial risk assessment under the involvement of the respective patients , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients treated for a greater el@@ ective orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy the cause of ana@@ emia is investigated and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ go a greater el@@ ective orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ ine diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded that in case of treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial treatment capacity of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative cy@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events may exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia , or dimin@@ ish the risk of tum@@ our progression .

the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an elevated inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .

survival and tumor progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated with an@@ emia due to a number of more frequent mal@@ ign@@ oma consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than with the controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ als and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ embo@@ lic events in tumor patients , which are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transfer@@ ring a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ te value below 13 g / dl , since few patients with these characteristics were included in the tested data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life time of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the Ser@@ um mirror of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the ser@@ um levels which are achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the ser@@ um levels remain equal regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

the owner of the authori@@ zation for the in@@ verter has to supply the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Educational brochures • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging line .
the owner of approval for the in@@ verter has to ensure that the pharmaceutical ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and is capable of being operational before the drug is brought into traffic and is used as long as it is used in traffic .
the owner of the author@@ isation for the in@@ verter is obliged to carry out the trials and additional measures to the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance , as in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as to each subsequent implementation of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management System for VAT products for human use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the uncertainty of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , PS@@ UR ) .
furthermore , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk reduction .
• in a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from un@@ stable an@@ gina p@@ ect@@ or@@ is ( first @-@ occurring or enhanced chest pain ) • the risk of blood drops in the v@@ eins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) has occurred .
you suffer from severe circulation disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lusion ) , the throat ( v@@ ascular disease of the kar@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you recently have a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a light dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in the blood flow rate , which returns again for further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly monitor the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron defici@@ ency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or foli@@ c defici@@ ency should be taken into account and treated before the beginning of the therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rare was reported about the occurr@@ ence of an anti@@ body @-@ determined er@@ y@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ y after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin inj@@ ected ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from y@@ th@@ rob@@ last@@ op@@ last@@ y , it will cancel your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your ana@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given through injection into a v@@ ene ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated for ana@@ emia due to a kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is the risk of problems with heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or offensive pot@@ assi@@ um , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assi@@ um values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney function and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ gestion signs by insufficient warmth , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of ana@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( kidney failure ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ zed , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into consideration for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood drops ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the advantages of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events , for example , if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic v@@ ascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or lung embo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and may affect the tumor in certain circumstances .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edi@@ c surgery , before treatment start with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ emia must be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ nasty ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because an increased risk of blood drops after the operation exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have been used recently / applied , even if it is not prescription medication .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory investigations have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood sugar ( ana@@ emia ) is applied to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you get regular dos@@ es of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ emia is addressed to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment period before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg may be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain ble@@ eding , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary arter@@ ies , v@@ ascular expansion ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial ni@@ cot@@ ine have been reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ itt@@ le ) both for women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( fra@@ c@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture like when falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or through injection into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ last@@ a may reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip fra@@ c@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years that recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures has been examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ reli@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared for six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator for effic@@ acy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enz@@ yme called bone substance ) decreased in the blood , or decreased at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal fra@@ c@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other ost@@ e@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ fic@@ ants ) was reduced by 70 % compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other ost@@ e@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cs ) , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion centre and ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides information material for physi@@ cians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for treating ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar materials for patients , in which the medicine &apos;s side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to grant approval for the marketing of Ac@@ last@@ a throughout the European Union .

treating ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis • in case of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis and ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fra@@ cture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients receiving treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly recommended for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly twice daily at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50.000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen in short after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney dys@@ function ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended because there is limited clinical experience for these patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and adol@@ escents Ac@@ reli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years of age , as data are lacking for in@@ suffici@@ ency and effectiveness .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient population only limited clinical experience .
prior to the beginning of the therapy with ac@@ last@@ a , a pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ine is treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hydr@@ ase can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly recommended for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly twice daily at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ er@@ ary disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who require dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of one patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days following administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen in short after application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the inci@@ dence of adverse side effects reported in patients receiving Ac@@ last@@ a increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ ORI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder , Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dys@@ function , associated as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study in ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ last@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed with 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory fun@@ dus , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were , at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received supple@@ mentary amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recently obtained hip fra@@ cture , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received vitamin D from the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local responses After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local responses to the in@@ fusion centre , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the or@@ thodon@@ tic area , especially in cancer patients , about ost@@ e@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the jaw area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid , were treated .
many of these patients had indications for local infections including ost@@ e@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following tooth extra@@ ctions or other dental im@@ plants .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients developed ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ sis in the or@@ thodon@@ tic area at a patient with ac@@ last@@ a and with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of over@@ dosage that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ine , it can be achieved by the administration of or@@ ally calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
effects on morph@@ ometric vert@@ eb@@ ral fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a sank significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ ral fra@@ c@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and older had reduced risk of sp@@ inal fra@@ c@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ reli@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures reduced by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hi@@ ps and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 increase of bone density of lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ral column by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip around 6.0 % , the th@@ igh@@ s around 5.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
in case of 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic mud .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ C@@ TX ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic inter@@ v@@ all during the study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ reli@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the output value and was kept at 28 % below the output value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ C@@ TX was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
the effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ ORI@@ Z@@ ON RF@@ T study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment is the BM@@ D at all times and end@@ ow@@ els at all points .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total cost and 4.3 % on the donation .
clinical effic@@ acy in men In the H@@ ORI@@ Z@@ ON RF@@ T study , 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a compared to once weekly gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate related to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ral BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effic@@ acy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ reli@@ a was examined with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ times to 3,0@@ m of age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was proven in two @-@ month comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed compared to the initial value for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as the study at the end of the six @-@ month study ( addressed to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was 141 with the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared with 71 patients treated with crack @-@ treated patients , with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ less .
after that the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid biological dis@@ appearing from the large circulation with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ al elim@@ ination period t ½ -@@ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and the elim@@ ination of the ki@@ d@@ neys .
in the first 24 h there is 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dose in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clearing is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a reduced clearing of metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enz@@ yme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ rever@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhib@@ itor of the P@@ 450@@ -
specific patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even kidney dys@@ function up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
for severe kidney dys@@ function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ own intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
in studies of dogs , individual dos@@ es of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application was measured by dos@@ es of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg than 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals . in dogs a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg , administ@@ ered in interval of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulative exposure , which exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ ct and liver , as well as intra@@ ven@@ ous injection .
the most common condition in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ de of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity with dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg than external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of skel@@ eton .
in ra@@ bb@@ its no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ f@@ etal effects were observed , although the mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ icity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of reduced ser@@ um @-@ calcium mirror .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a sub@@ category called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormon@@ es , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in the more gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ last@@ a works by restor@@ ing bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and gives the bones again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or under@@ go dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
if you use ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines request inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines or used recently / applied , even if it is not prescription medication .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm the ki@@ d@@ neys .
in the application of Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and beverages , you worry that you take sufficient fluid in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a v@@ ene .

patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture is recommended to carry the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fra@@ cture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a the patients need to be supplied with liquid . this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ene can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ reli@@ a .
in addition , it is highly recommended for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least twice a daily 500 mg of vital calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture a starting dose of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .

A@@ comp@@ lia is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients who suffer from obes@@ ity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • the over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and also one or more I
in addition , four studies have been carried out over 7,@@ 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used in comparison to a plac@@ ebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive remedy for the setting of smoking .
the study on the attitudes of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess on this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? he The most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respir@@ atory .
it may also be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants as it may increase the risk of depression and among other things , in a small minority of patients .
caution is provided in case of simultaneous use of A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( pharmaceuticals against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( anti@@ biotics ) .

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years due to the lack of data on effic@@ acy and uncertainty .
the depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported with up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients who received the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
he also in patients who - apart from obes@@ ity - have no visible risk , can occur depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other nearby people may suggest that it is necessary to monitor the new occurr@@ ence of such symptoms and take immediate medical advice when these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The effic@@ acy and harm@@ less@@ ness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .

this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ related diabetes ) . it can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medication ) is not shown .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be dis@@ satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ ylene resin or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ mac@@ s or ins@@ ulin can be maintained with the commen@@ cement of the Ac@@ tos Treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um and ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s ins@@ ulin can be better utili@@ zed and the blood sugar level drops , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the effic@@ acy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ onic resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows the blood sugar levels to be reduced by applying dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ onic acid showed 0.@@ 94 % while the additional offering of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ in and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , reduced the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving additional plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tra@@ ct ( cold ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ ose socket ( high glu@@ cose level - acid level - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 the European Commission approved the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to grant approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , v@@ aul@@ ted , and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or int@@ oler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age is not available , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are end@@ anger@@ ed by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest dos@@ es dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study conducted with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing macro@@ ph@@ atic disease was carried out .
in this study an increase in reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver illness , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver cell values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hep@@ atic dys@@ function , such as un@@ cleared nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , red@@ ness , appeti@@ te and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , the liver cell values are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the preliminary results of clinical evaluation should be conducted .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and in some cases linked with a fluid retention .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es was reduced ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed when controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and a lower extent also observed in patients with sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ine and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity there are patients who receive the pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral secondary or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ ate resin or as a secondary combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the introduction of the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the inci@@ dence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity was reported .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but conc@@ ord@@ n@@ ating physi@@ cians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients talk about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fra@@ c@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated Fra@@ cture inci@@ dence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years at the women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ active Study , a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.2 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative study .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes pregnancy or entering it , the treatment is removed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes such as oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hib@@ itor ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin inhib@@ itor and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent can be reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ etal growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ ors and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents appeared on triple the upper limit of the normal range as often as under plac@@ ebo , but less less than in comparison groups using met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ ylene resin .
in an out@@ going study in patients with advanced macro@@ ph@@ atic disease , the frequency of severe heart failure occurred under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on respectively .
since the introduction of the market launch , it was rarely reported via heart failure in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
there was a summary analysis of adverse events with random@@ ised controlled , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated with a comparison @-@ medi@@ ated group .

when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , after 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and the peripheral glu@@ cose evaluation in the case of ins@@ ulin resistance increases .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until after@@ treatment of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite a three @-@ month optimization phase with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate , to be random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients , which continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ ratio compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks study on type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L cholesterol level as well as slightly , clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol level .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ matri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol level was observed , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was not only the n@@ üch@@ tern tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ pran@@ ational tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des , both on an effect on tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des .
in the Pro@@ active Study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing ma@@ kro@@ v@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized to receive either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo for a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ b@@ ished , whereby the peak concent@@ rations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on can be achieved in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributes to effic@@ acy in roughly the triple of the effic@@ acy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effic@@ acy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral application of radio@@ active marker pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the rot ( 55 % ) and a l@@ esser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elim@@ ination radius of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concent@@ rations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es are lower than for patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and mon@@ keys were consistent with hem@@ odi@@ lution , ana@@ emia and rever@@ sible ex@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on inhib@@ its the resulting hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent animal and thereby reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ etal growth .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as could not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes which the body is unable to utili@@ ze the ins@@ ulin effectively .
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the dos@@ es of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the packaging line ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission approved the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the application of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glu@@ cose adjustment has significantly improved through intensive ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ axial , long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin analog@@ on ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards ins@@ ulin ) can cause a change of the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary for the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the transition .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than with previous ins@@ ulin .
before traveling , which pass over several periods of time , the patient should be advised to enter the advice of his physician , as such trips may cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used to other times .
the doctor has to take into account possible interactions with the therapy and to ask his patients to other medicines taken by them .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients that have already signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gyp@@ sum ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the res@@ ins are still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased once a day 120 mg daily .
during the first treatment months there may still be toxic effects ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking further medicine for preventing tox@@ icity .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effic@@ acy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drug ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main indicator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients whose urine acid resp@@ ects in the blood for the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once a day of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who received 120 mg daily during the last three measurements in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 from 268 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart attacks may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the urine &apos;s resp@@ i@@ ration as al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine samples ( including one of the history known or currently available for g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ ct and / or g@@ g@@ nosis ) .
if the ser@@ um acid resp@@ ects after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day can be considered .
in patients with severe kidney function , effic@@ acy and safety were not fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people There is no experience in children and adol@@ escents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group group .

cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ c@@ res@@ sive medicines , it may occur during treatment start to acute g@@ arb@@ age , because by lowering the ser@@ um of ser@@ um in the tis@@ sues can be mobili@@ zed in the tis@@ sues .
B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far reaching that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tra@@ ct .
liver diseases During the Phase 3 clinical studies , slight refres@@ h@@ ments of the liver function values were observed with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform at the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ ology and in the further course according to clinical findings and a liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ ist was not carried out in@@ scription studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that X@@ O inhib@@ itor can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ene level ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhib@@ itors ) .
for subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen is 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ ype ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

7 Open long @-@ term extensions studies In open long @-@ term extensions , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups in total more than once , and appeared in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the indications .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these dos@@ es or with a smaller frequency :

the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional dos@@ es Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg daily .

the reduction of ser@@ um acid resp@@ i@@ ration at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the medical visit in week 2 and maintained permanently on the whole treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer treatment &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .

AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary effic@@ acy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage return of ser@@ um res@@ ent concent@@ rations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ function ) .
primary end@@ point in the group of patients with ser@@ um res@@ ent concent@@ rations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um res@@ ent concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease of ser@@ um res@@ ins was found at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed no treatment against a cargo restra@@ int ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a cast ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ arb@@ ons size associated with 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiva until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extensions studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects the maximum plasma concent@@ rations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at for administration easier and multiple dos@@ es of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for dos@@ es between 120 mg and 300 mg , the AU@@ C increase is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional rise .
after taking simple or multiple oral dos@@ es of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x is approx . 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes were observed in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um acid concentration , as far as this was checked ( multiple dos@@ es of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is from 29 to 75 l after taking dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma nit@@ rate binding of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentration width that is reached with dos@@ es of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es are formed mainly by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ oids are formed mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ eted Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in urine as an un@@ alter@@ able Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ alter@@ able Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es ( 7 % ) .
patients with kidney failure after taking multiple dos@@ es of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at changed not in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the middle overall AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 times of 7.5 μ / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder cancer ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was only found in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly d@@ osed group , for about the 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a special @-@ specific Pur@@ ine met@@ abolic and urine composition and for clinical use as not relevant .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral dos@@ es of up to 48 mg / kg / day did not affect the fertility and reproduction power of male and female rats .
at high dos@@ es which were about 4 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ icity appeared that occurred with a reduction of the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the desc@@ endants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for treating ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ itt@@ led ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not take place after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the Company established data from earlier studies and published literature .
in addition , the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effic@@ acy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who took only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also placed data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose prescribed for the prevention of bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the di@@ ges@@ tive apparatus , such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sie ( di@@ ges@@ tive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE cannot be applied .
it may not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit in at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking drugs ( including Ant@@ acids , Cal@@ cium , and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
following indications are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew or break the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ation .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tra@@ ct except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see Section 4.3 ) .
ob@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions like Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ation and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ ie , pain while swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or deteri@@ or@@ ated so@@ dium burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be elevated to patients who do not take the medicine correct and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk , there were rare ( after market introduction ) gast@@ ric and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some serious and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including ost@@ e@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ ies were administ@@ ered mainly intra@@ ven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to indicate whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients need to be instruct@@ ed that they should take the tablet to the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but taking taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D defici@@ ency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be addressed adequ@@ ately before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients need to wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only for the application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not suitable for pregnant women during pregnancy .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron give no indication of directly harmful effects regarding pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal or post@@ nat@@ al development .
ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ um decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % at the sp@@ inal column , 5.@@ 9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % of the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , a reduction in the plac@@ ebo group was reduced by 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vert@@ eb@@ ral fra@@ c@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of vert@@ eb@@ ral column and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ e and the whole body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the inci@@ dence of at least one new ed@@ dy fra@@ cture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was 0,@@ 64 % for dos@@ es between 5 and 70 m@@ g. compared to noc@@ turn@@ al fast and two hours before taking a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily above five days ) resulted in no clin@@ ically significant change of the or@@ al bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range between 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats showed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is distributed temporarily in wil@@ low tissue after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly distributed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
elim@@ ination After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , about 50 % of the radio@@ active substances were eliminated within 72 hours with the urine and less or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic clearing exce@@ eds 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not eliminated by the aci@@ dic or basic transport system of the ki@@ d@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by means of these transport systems .
absorption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) , after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE after night fast and two hours prior to intake a meal the medium surface under the ser@@ um concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without considering end@@ ogen@@ ous vitamin D3 ) .
mean maximum concentration in ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time to reaching the maximum ser@@ um concentration ( t@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 in the liver and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of radio@@ active and marked vitamin D3 to healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the subjects after 4 days 4.3 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron , which is not derived from the bones , is rapidly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a somewhat increased cum@@ ulation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at &apos;s non @-@ clinical data on the basis of conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , for chronic tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and channel @-@ balanced potential leave no particular dangers for humans .
studies of rats showed that the gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was associated with the occurr@@ ence of d@@ yst@@ ok@@ ie in the mat@@ ernity , which was attri@@ but@@ able to a hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia .

advoc@@ ate is administ@@ ered adult patients who were transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously performed studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of liv@@ agra@@ f with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of effic@@ acy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or res@@ ection of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been carried out to 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how it is included in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer from the body .
Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , elevated blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , and in@@ som@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) .
patients with persistent hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ tis anti@@ biotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be c@@ auti@@ ous if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with cust@@ ody as the result must be adjusted accordingly or the dose of the medication necessary at the same time .
hard @-@ capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ze yellow @-@ orange jel@@ ly capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule bottom with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; 30ml 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may result in transplan@@ t rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects including sub @-@ treatment or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dose ; changing the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of one in the transplan@@ tation of experienced doctors ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to alternative form@@ ulation , therapeutic drug control and appropriate dos@@ es must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus remains maintained .
the dosage of advoc@@ ate should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and compatibility in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations )
according to the switch from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ m Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after transition .
on day 4 , system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley level , was comparable with both terms of both ni@@ cot@@ ine and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus bottom mirror are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation in advance to ensure proper substance exposure in immediate follow @-@ up phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the advance dose can last several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ tic Treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ous ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml Concent@@ rate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the suppression of the transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advoc@@ ate therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ es may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral liv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dose recommendation - Shift from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f Must have a Tran@@ splan@@ tation Tran@@ splan@@ t twice daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of liv@@ estock , so this conversion in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) is related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation after transition from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to liv@@ agra@@ f once a day , treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection is to begin .
cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to liv@@ estock , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day must be taken daily in the morning .
other Tran@@ splan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with advoc@@ ates in pul@@ mon@@ ary , p@@ ank@@ le@@ as@@ - and transplan@@ ted patients , patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ t recep@@ tors in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day are applied .
dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood vessels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function as the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cancer , a comp@@ utation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ iner@@ ation and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When converting a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the valley level in the whole blood The dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of rejection and compatibility in the individual case under the aid of full blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks controls .
it is recommended frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus bottom level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic insp@@ ections during maintenance therapy .
blood Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled according to the switch from Progra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as advoc@@ ate is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the indications in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the bottom level of the blood is 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the bottom level of Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with gl@@ ands and heart@@ felt transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tors , blood concent@@ rations were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t rejection or other side effects , which may occur in succession of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dose ; changing the form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of one in the transplan@@ tation of experienced doctors ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rejection , proven to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va as therap@@ ist , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation .
for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tors and gra@@ ft recep@@ tors in childhood age there are no clinical data for ret@@ ardi@@ zed form@@ ulation .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effic@@ acy of Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) contains , or other plant extracts during treatment with asp@@ ir@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ onic concent@@ rations in the blood has been given , since the Tac@@ tic Blood mirror may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under the program a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed to observe chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ es which can therefore also occur under advance .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluids and o@@ ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun@@ shield with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered states of consciousness , cra@@ mp@@ ings and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as the liv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose are included , in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase defici@@ ency or glu@@ cose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedi@@ es that are known as inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and decrease .
therefore , it is advis@@ able to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s blood levels while controlling the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ oz@@ al dose to maintain regular concent@@ rations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies resulted in the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of the g@@ astro@@ intestinal extension .

as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus desc@@ end the clearing of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thereby increase hormone exposure , decisions about contra@@ cep@@ tive measures should be particularly careful .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of tests on transplan@@ t patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va a higher risk for und@@ esi@@ rable events in terms of the course and the outcome of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposition , monitoring of new@@ born on possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially concerning its impact on ki@@ d@@ neys ) is recommended .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ u@@ bility and high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell .

lung transplan@@ tation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ cent@@ ric study with oral program was reported via 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
a chronic transplan@@ t rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was often observed less frequently in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ um and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the lung@@ ing patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ splan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study the frequency of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ ory and low protein concent@@ rations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fra@@ ction of Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this can conclude that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before the elim@@ ination , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out via the bile .
in case of stable patients treated by Progra@@ f ( twice a day ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ oz@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was below 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f .

advoc@@ ates are used for treating and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ related , con@@ gen@@ ital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are directed to whether the Adv@@ ant@@ ages are applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or for prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII defici@@ ency , which causes ble@@ eding problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extra@@ cted from human plasma but according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into the formation of the human nerve factor VIII .
Adv@@ ances is a medication approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is produced differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the effic@@ acy of Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood tests with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; is assessed .
the most common side effects of asp@@ ir@@ in ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII .
advoc@@ ates may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against the human nerve factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the incor@@ poration of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of substitu@@ tion therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defici@@ ency , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment course , a suitable determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , which have different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given dos@@ es between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhib@@ itor if necessary .
in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be vo@@ iced .
depending on the patient &apos;s condition , the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing anti@@ bodies ( inhib@@ itors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhib@@ itors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ische activity of factor VIII , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhib@@ itors cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ posi@@ tional layers and an@@ am@@ al@@ tic @-@ known inhib@@ itors , after transition from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ formation of ( low ti@@ tration ) inhib@@ itors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences in the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
the AD@@ R@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were in@@ hi@@ bit@@ oren against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which have a higher risk of formation of inhib@@ itors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) .

in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnos@@ ed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .

based on the data available since the first approval , CH@@ MP has still considered a positive assessment , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
for this reason , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ ATE &apos;s safety profile , which is required for a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months , decided that the author@@ isation holder should apply for additional extensions in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company adop@@ ts its application for the application of Adv@@ ant@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the female parts ( tissue that combines other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ er@@ sin@@ i@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious di@@ arr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into tum@@ ours and thus enabling the cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein which is formed from non @-@ def@@ ective genes in the human body , usually contributes to recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and share .
the company placed data from a study with a patient before , with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ strate , bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on which questions asked him , there were still some questions .
based on the exam of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP hand@@ written 120 a list of questions sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP &apos;s opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that the Adv@@ ant@@ ages can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company was not aware of the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of active ingredient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled so that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slow over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal all@@ ergy r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( hay fever , caused by an all@@ ergy against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al sw@@ elling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adol@@ escents over the age of 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be followed by con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever , which were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , the patients receiving aer@@ ina@@ ze reported a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35,@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , patients showed a relief of the symptoms by 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( heart j@@ ages ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( imp@@ air@@ ment ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( imp@@ air@@ ment ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for treating allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a bot@@ an@@ ical glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ) or hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission approved the company SP Europe appro@@ ving approval for the transport of aer@@ ina@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ low the whole ( i.e. without cr@@ ushed or cr@@ ushed ) .
aero@@ bic should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application period to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin can be taken off with time .
after the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ atory system , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ ino@@ xi@@ dation ( MA@@ O ) inhib@@ itor or within 2 weeks after finishing such therapy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ g@@ oli@@ d , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ gen@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tives ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effic@@ acy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
safety and effic@@ acy of aer@@ ina@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed that the treatment in inci@@ dence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ ometer or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or strengthening of head@@ ache ) must be removed .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their extent .
during clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences could be observed between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enz@@ yme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is not inhib@@ ited in vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ less@@ ness of the use of aer@@ ina@@ osis during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
because reproduction studies of animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases , which may lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ble , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ ter@@ ways .
head@@ ache , anxiety , weak mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , ar@@ ous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ corneal pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ inn@@ itus , respir@@ atory , visual disorders , hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , like at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ ill@@ ary star@@ ch and di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of inflam@@ matory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adh@@ esion promot@@ er P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
a single dose @-@ study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flu@@ idity , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause other sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ation of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal all@@ ergy r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 414 patients received aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ ist effic@@ acy of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effic@@ acy of aero@@ bic tablets in terms of the decreasing effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin via the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effic@@ acy of aero@@ bic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aero@@ bic in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow rate of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lau@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the form@@ ulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were badly displac@@ ed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the all@@ ay gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was used for exposure to the gift of an aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can detect any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in reprodu@@ ci@@ ble ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was the oral gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and ra@@ bb@@ its in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ G@@ - Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat for taking ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 M@@ G@@ - and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight trials with approximately 4 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four trials on seasonal all@@ erg@@ y@@ r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies of patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
effic@@ acy was measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rup@@ eds , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body is the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are harm@@ less .
in allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us showed an average decrease of the symptoms of symptoms ( symptoms point ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms of symptoms after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission approved the company SP Europe appro@@ ves approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent all@@ ergy r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials on effic@@ acy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adol@@ escents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous illness , and can be res@@ umed after the end of the symptoms and will be res@@ umed .
the persistent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergi@@ c period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effic@@ acy of alcohol and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to harm reduction or ability to serve machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients aged 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect of head@@ ache was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and with 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes the in@@ hibition of the release of inflam@@ matory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adh@@ esion promot@@ er P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple dos@@ es , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring sizes of the flu@@ idity , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ cot@@ ine , nas@@ al sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and persistent all@@ ergy r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Per@@ sian r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall model of the question@@ naire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is not@@ e@@ worthy of ae@@ ti@@ ology in different forms , and chronic patients can be rec@@ alled easily .
since the hist@@ am@@ inf@@ ant is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also associated with other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients not responded to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines from the study .
an improvement of it@@ ching over 50 % was observed with 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the dis@@ ruption of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which was comparable to patients with the general seasonal all@@ erg@@ istic Rhin@@ i@@ tis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no indication for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enz@@ yme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate was not identified , so interactions with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not in@@ hi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the pre @-@ clinical trials presented with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed a comparable degree of the exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the Tox@@ icity Test of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent all@@ ergy r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available , which support a treatment of a inf@@ ec@@ tious Rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical exam@@ inations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have been metaboli@@ zed by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and have a higher sub@@ strate load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years is identical with the children who metaboli@@ ze normal met@@ abolic processes .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption , or sac@@ char@@ ase I@@ som@@ al @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency do not take this medicine .
clinical relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administ@@ ered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol may not ampli@@ fy the effectiveness of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adol@@ escents in different indications , including allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 3 % was reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adol@@ escents with which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , which came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose @-@ dose of 1.@@ 25@@ mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the effic@@ acy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be extra@@ pol@@ ated by adults to the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple dos@@ es of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents has no increased frequency of d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in case of a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents in clinical trials have no impact on psych@@ om@@ otor skills .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol was neither an increase of alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment nor to increase the d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ cot@@ ine , nas@@ al sec@@ re@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as demonstrated by the overall model of the question@@ naire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the effects caused by seasonal allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis
in two plac@@ ebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abolic end@@ othel@@ ial was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the si@@ ren form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher than 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of approximately 120 hours .
there are no evidence for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C- and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enz@@ yme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ inate was not identified , so interactions with other medicines can not be excluded .

in a multi @-@ dose study used up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical exam@@ inations , vit@@ als and EC@@ G interval data .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple dos@@ es , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

the effic@@ acy and harm@@ less@@ ness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of mel@@ ting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ ren and the plac@@ ebo group was identical and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed mel@@ ting tablets as bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets form@@ ulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ate for binding form@@ ulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .

the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in small children aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were reported , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
an additional study was observed in a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin &apos; solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended dos@@ es were comparable to the plasma concent@@ rations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adol@@ escents has no increased frequency of d@@ row@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis may result in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis as an alternative to the duration of the symptoms .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company adop@@ ts its application for inf@@ rin@@ gement of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that could cause the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu epide@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread by humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vacc@@ ine the immune system reco@@ gnis@@ es the parts of the flu virus as a &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it .
in this way , the immune system is able to form a rapid anti@@ body in contact with a influ@@ enza virus .
afterwards , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which reco@@ gnis@@ es human body as a foreign body ) is puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vacc@@ ine .
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
in this way , the extent of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vacc@@ ine to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you want more information regarding CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for treating adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immune defici@@ ency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should first be prescribed if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral medication of the patient before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the virus has to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , which will be taken together twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose depends on the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount of blood in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs .
aids are not he@@ aled , however , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and ill@@ nesses can be hes@@ it@@ ated .
A@@ gener@@ ase was used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were previously treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine has been compared with 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors , compared to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers .
the main indicator for effic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concent@@ rations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia were very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors , the treatment associated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors , it came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus last after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and f@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are just as am@@ eth@@ ase and are in high concent@@ rations in the blood are harmful to health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase take the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the recovery immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ wei@@ gh the risks .
in general , A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee concluded that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have a prot@@ e@@ as@@ former have not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 the European Commission divided the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited to grant approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administ@@ ered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance mu@@ sters and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ tion is 14 % smaller than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to absor@@ b a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher dos@@ es of acid ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effic@@ acy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effic@@ acy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate hep@@ atic dys@@ function should be reduced twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ function to 300 mg twice a day .
in patients with severe liver function , they are contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver function disorder ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ dium 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations that contain the Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concent@@ rations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver disease with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the specialist information of this medicine .
patients with reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis indicate a higher frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ co @-@ co@@ ids , which are confused over C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ero@@ id effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itor of Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active substance concentration are available .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effic@@ acy of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for O@@ pi@@ at@@ ment symptoms , especially if low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administ@@ ered .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this presentation form is contra@@ indicated for children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms can be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors were reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia , or a her@@ edit@@ ary of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses that were necessary for their treatment medications which are associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in h@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ ytes and ha@@ emat@@ odes .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ity may develop an inflam@@ matory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eth@@ ear@@ ology ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ dium 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active substances are primarily associated with C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhib@@ itors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very common adverse effects on the liver were observed .
JOHAN@@ N@@ IS@@ KRA@@ UT ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , to check the virus last and remove the cur@@ rant .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) combined with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , which substanti@@ ate the effic@@ acy and harm@@ less@@ ness of this treatment scheme .
52 % decre@@ ases if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) combined with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered twice a day .
the c@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administ@@ ered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ agon@@ ist component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) , no dose adjustment is required twice daily .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ef@@ ans would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin is possibly lowering the Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if this medicine is used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in adverse side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is to be administ@@ ered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended at least half of the recommended dosage although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ het@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ THC ) to the 2,@@ 69 times compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ent@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhib@@ itors or induc@@ tors from C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , can potentially lead to interactions .
the patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions , which are linked to these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enz@@ ym@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduction of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concent@@ rations of calcium channel blo@@ wers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous taking with a@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concent@@ rations considerably and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhib@@ itors in conjunction with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ sis pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) more than 7 days of subjects were given , the fluor@@ escent pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % ) interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of a@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose cor@@ relation is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of plasma levels while administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhib@@ itors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concent@@ rations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since plasma concent@@ rations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ omy inhib@@ itors indicate a possible rise in plasma levels by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am um 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored for O@@ pi@@ at@@ ment symptoms , especially if low dos@@ es of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administ@@ ered .
due to the low per@@ me@@ ability of historical comparison , no recommendation can be given , such as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose , when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
in case of simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase a increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic action ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predi@@ ctable , therefore alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be applied after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for fo@@ etus .
in the milk of lac@@ ri@@ mal rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by the in@@ junction in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight in the desc@@ endants .
the further development of the desc@@ endants , including the fertility and reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the inc@@ ub@@ ation of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly elevated to moderate , occurred early and often led to treatment break .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of a@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment or whether they are a result of the disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tia did not receive 1200 mg of a@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ ation and in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rop@@ hi@@ e ) in HIV patients , including loss of peri@@ pher@@ ical and fa@@ zi@@ al skin fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of bre@@ asts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral infections , which were treated with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ vu@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 appeared at 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various NR@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
skin extracts were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ idal nature , with or without it@@ ching and stepped up spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks without having to break the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of ost@@ e@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective , it can develop an inflam@@ matory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of a@@ gener@@ ase twice a day with low do@@ si@@ fied ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) to those who were observed under sole A@@ gener@@ ase treatment ; an exception formed enh@@ ancements of tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ d and C@@ PK values that were received in patients who received a@@ gener@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very common .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ formation with the result of a formation of un@@ rip@@ e , non @-@ inf@@ ec@@ tious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic ly@@ mph@@ oma cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concent@@ ration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.0@@ 012 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in case of chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral infections associated with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , the mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed .
in six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral infections , which received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates could be studied .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhib@@ itors did not appear to pre@@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 m@@ g. of Fos@@ amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical fail@@ ures for over 96 weeks .
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ former resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ ossi@@ amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resist@@ ence as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased chance of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyse the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analysis clin@@ ically vali@@ dated ph@@ allic interpret@@ ations can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ former resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resist@@ ances have developed clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern produces a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently dates for cru@@ de resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment ( one of them indicated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early out@@ break of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations occurring in the following treatment .
the proof of effic@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults according to vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice a day ) and Nu@@ kle@@ mati@@ tis ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with a low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the plasma load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day .
no low dos@@ es were given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) along with A@@ gener@@ ase approved NR@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients concluded a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with PI pre @-@ treatment children who are expected to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the medium duration ( t@@ max ) amounts to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administ@@ ered twice daily with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( c@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ ob@@ struct@@ ed penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the bloo@@ d@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which remains the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient is constant during the dosage interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicine must in@@ duce or inhib@@ its C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or pose a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , administ@@ ered with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ b@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ compatible than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ es basis .
the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible . therefore , the effect of a kidney dys@@ function should be minimal at the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on ra@@ bb@@ its with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ zell@@ ul@@ äre Aden@@ oma occur@@ ren@@ ces in dos@@ ages that correspond to the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rats ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ ato@@ cell Aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet informed and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , there was little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chrom@@ osom@@ al aber@@ rations were involved in human peripheral ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant hep@@ atic tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of a@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies of tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated from a age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in the inspection and with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure among therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and light skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher dos@@ es of acid ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with severe liver function , they are contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver function disorder ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of the active substance concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set up in duration 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms can be accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
508 % increased for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) combined with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the c@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) is administ@@ ered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ef@@ ans would be low .
if this medicine is used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as an accurate predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administ@@ ered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , is recommended to reduce the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least one half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
the ser@@ um concent@@ rations of calcium channel blo@@ ckers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , causing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ sis pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) more than 7 days of subjects were given , the fluor@@ escent pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % ) interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
in case of simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase a increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic action ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and c@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the f@@ etus .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by the in@@ junction in the u@@ ter@@ us until the end of the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in the desc@@ endants .
the inc@@ ub@@ ation of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic ly@@ mph@@ oma cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concent@@ ration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.0@@ 012 to 0.0@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exhaust gases should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient is constant during the dosage interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicine must in@@ duce or inhib@@ its C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or pose a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , administ@@ ered with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function should be low to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on ra@@ ging with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ zell@@ ul@@ äre Aden@@ oma occurred in dos@@ ages that correspond to the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rats ) of exposure to humans after twice daily offering of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele Aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet informed and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , there was little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chrom@@ osom@@ al aber@@ rations involved in human peripheral ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of f@@ lin@@ ts in the gen@@ ital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is applied to the affected skin areas before bed@@ time , so that it will remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the gen@@ ital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete removal of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined to 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for effic@@ acy was the number of patients with complete removal of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 505 patients with nu@@ de ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the gen@@ ital area , the complete reduction rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas showed a complete treatment rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .

in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended dos@@ es there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which caused a treatment and / or caused by temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties in the water , which made an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .

treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ony within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or hair attachment was not investigated .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of this reaction takes place in general during therapy or the reactions form after finishing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream .
if it is necessary due to the dis@@ comfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days may be made .
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data on long term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment should be with@@ drawn with super @-@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experience , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of act@@ in@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears , or on the lip area within the lip area .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of act@@ in@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the l@@ act@@ in@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands support effectiveness in this application purpose , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions normally take the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after removing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AC@@ -@@ l@@ esi@@ ons showed a less complete recovery rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide cream should be applied with care in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

a minimal system@@ ic absorption of 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with act@@ in@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concent@@ rations in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and wor@@ r@@ n 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ value period was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; it points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low and comparable to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable with the healthy adults and adults with act@@ in@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the paint tox@@ icity at the rat led dos@@ es of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG were significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months has no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice during m@@ aler administration at three days per week induced no tum@@ ours at the application centre .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide has only a low system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and does not mut@@ ate , a risk for humans is considered very low due to system@@ ic exposure .

this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amine , G@@ AG@@ s ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and harm them .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the motions more difficult , lower lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent allergi@@ c reaction .

the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effic@@ acy ( by exam@@ ining its effectiveness in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concent@@ rations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , the G@@ AG concent@@ rations in urine were about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ ath@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ oter fro@@ st .
al@@ dur@@ ac@@ ea may not be applied to patients who may be highly sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , check and update this summary if necessary .
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms will receive patients who receive al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission approved the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the distribution of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese hamster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ yme is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ yme therapy in patients with diagnos@@ ed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase defici@@ ency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ ea in adults over 65 years has not been established , and for these patients no dos@@ es scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ ea in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established , and for these patients no dos@@ es scheme can be recommended .
patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effects associated during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically , these patients should also be monitored closely mes@@ hed , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing devices are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a prolon@@ ged inter@@ ruption , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be c@@ auti@@ ous after inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minim@@ ise the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduced in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused to decrease treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or PRO@@ CA@@ INE because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular acceptance of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated compared to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over breast milk , is recommended to bre@@ ast@@ feeding with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms .
the side effects in clinical studies were mainly prescribed as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
und@@ esi@@ rable drug reactions associated with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respir@@ atory tra@@ ct and l@@ ungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions occur , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , bre@@ ast@@ stroke and facial ö@@ der ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe distortion and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks .
in most patients , within 3 months after the treatment was converted to a ser@@ o@@ tap@@ a , it usually occurred within a month after a ser@@ o@@ conversion ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ rä@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ort@@ able anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients with whom it was never to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ t .
patients with a lack of anti@@ body mirror showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while patients with high anti@@ bodies had a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ onia activity in vitro , which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effic@@ acy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of anti@@ bodies didn &apos;t seem to be associated with the inci@@ dence of und@@ esi@@ red drug reactions , although the occurr@@ ence of und@@ esi@@ red drug reactions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies .
the reason for the enz@@ yme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate restoration of enz@@ yme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circuit and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ osom@@ es , most likely on Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors .
the safety and effic@@ acy of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms were analyzed in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effic@@ acy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ ea each week ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ al patients treated with the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and the ability to ga@@ ze in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms / al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms group , as shown in the table below .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks there was a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous manifest@@ ation between the patients treated by using a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes were observed for five effic@@ acy variable ( expected pro@@ c@@ tional normal FE@@ V , course in 6 @-@ minute walking test , movement range of the shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ a@@ zu@@ y@@ ms were examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the severe distortion form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe slow@@ down form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe distortion @-@ shape only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks can be a substitute alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fusion ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effic@@ acy of these two dos@@ es schem@@ as is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated annually .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to the patients in older and lower patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with unique gift , tox@@ icity in repeated gift and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data does not detect any particular dangers for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except under 6 . 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who do not have chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy for previously other chemotherapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid defici@@ ency ) should be given .
in patients whose blood cells change or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed up , decre@@ ases or decre@@ ases the dose .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ ry is thus slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ al cells into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concent@@ rations of the active form of drug and a longer time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease were compared with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( a further medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin over an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.8 months , compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer periods of survival than with the comparative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for author@@ isation for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle must be dis@@ solved with 4.3 ml 0.9 % of so@@ dium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the required dosage is taken from the bottle and is dil@@ uted with 0.9 % so@@ dium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin to the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ cl@@ one bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for predominantly the@@ epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in two @-@ line therapy of patients with lo@@ - kal advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ isolated bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except for over @-@ supporting plate epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of the in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the end of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the tel@@ emet@@ ry gift , as well as on the day after the treatment , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids will be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ al stimulation , at least 5 dos@@ es of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy process as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ al dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first p@@ emet@@ ric dose as well as after each third operation cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ ry , a complete blood screen should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ an@@ in trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place , taking consideration of the n@@ adi@@ rs of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity of predi@@ cting therapeutic cycles .
after the recovery , patients need to be treated according to the critics in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 Blood .
if patients do not develop ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ es @-@ reduc@@ ers , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so forth in the occurr@@ ence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that patients aged 65 years or more compared to patients aged 65 years were an increased side effects .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harm@@ less@@ ness and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dos@@ es of dos@@ es were necessary , which go beyond the dos@@ es recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restri@@ ction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper bi@@ lic@@ al values and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of the upper boundary value ( at Ab@@ - Being of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically examined in studies .
patients need to be supervis@@ ed with regard to the bone mar@@ row , and p@@ emet@@ al cells may not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic value has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - zy@@ ten@@ fold has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic number , t@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity , as it has been observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ eli@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia became ob@@ sc@@ ous when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients with p@@ emet@@ al treated patients need to be instruct@@ ed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to avoid simultaneous intake of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ r@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ di@@ - and 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ al detection ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ry must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value period for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ al correc@@ tions ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who occurred these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ genic space , a drainage of the ergometer should be considered in front of the tel@@ emet@@ ry treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with p@@ emet@@ eries , if this active ingredient is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated lifetime vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ rever@@ sible har@@ dening of re@@ productive capacity by p@@ emet@@ ry , men should be pointed out before the treatment plant should be advised to obtain advice on the sperm conservation process .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high dos@@ es of non ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to reduced p@@ emet@@ al elim@@ ination with the result of an increased occurr@@ ence of side effects .
therefore caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used high dos@@ es of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ di@@ - or 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ al defects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of tel@@ emet@@ ry must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the nervous system during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ stimul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ ry in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - , an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ shed , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ ry may not be used during pregnancy , except if absolutely - and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ rever@@ sible damage of re@@ productive capacity by p@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised before the start of treatment , consult with regard to the sperm con@@ gestion .
it is not known whether the tel@@ emet@@ ry passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects in the di@@ still@@ ed inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received medical examination in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- tin arm ( 218 patients ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ing ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without affecting the quality of pro@@ - du@@ kt@@ ops .
it is used with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take all@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzy@@ mes are inhib@@ ited , they can &apos;t ab@@ stain some fats in food , thereby causing a quarter of fats fed with food int@@ oler@@ ance to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received all@@ i 60 mg after a year showed an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss was observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with bow@@ el finish , bow@@ ed strand , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , depart@@ ing o@@ ily sec@@ re@@ tion ( win@@ ches ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( wind ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients dealing with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for prevention of blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which does not contain enough nutrients from the di@@ ges@@ tive tra@@ ct ) or to cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission divided the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited to sell Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a lightweight hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ phic , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
all@@ i must not be applied by children and adol@@ escents under 18 , as insufficient data is available for effic@@ acy and safety .
however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ b@@ ated , the dosage is necessary for elderly and in patients with limited liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of other ingredients • Pre@@ mature treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurr@@ ence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can occur with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before the start of treatment with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adapted accordingly .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines must be adapted .
it is recommended to meet additional pregnant prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contra@@ c@@ eption in case of severe di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of Or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Values ( international norm@@ ative ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
most patients treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ ate remained the concent@@ rations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamins intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a dispos@@ able dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received Or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal flora and related with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were measured from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency ranges are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) .
the inci@@ dence of known side effects noted after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were volunt@@ arily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
it is plau@@ sible that treating allergi@@ es with all@@ i can lead to potential or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single dos@@ es of 800 m@@ g. of or@@ list@@ ate and multiple dos@@ es of up to 400 mg three times daily were administ@@ ered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals it is possible to proceed from a rapid re@@ formation of any system@@ ic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ th@@ ous characteristics of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect continues in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ ic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical trials , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ ate was taken three times a day to block the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the effic@@ acy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ ate which was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the alter@@ ation of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants that lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total chol@@ est@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average changes in the L@@ DL cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the wa@@ ist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concent@@ rations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable in 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , therapeutic dos@@ ages could not be metaboli@@ zed in the plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concent@@ rations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study involving adi@@ p@@ ous patients with which the minimal system@@ ic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose was administ@@ ered , two main met@@ abolic processes were identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ ophi@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split@@ ting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ Leu@@ c@@ ine Group ) , which presented approximate 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , channel ogen@@ ic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , pre @-@ clinical data does not detect any particular danger to humans .

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after treatment start , as you might have not yet reduced the fat percentage in the diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutrition @-@ related symptoms : • For a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced nutrition . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of por@@ tions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended fat quantity ev@@ enly on daily meals .
save the amount of cal@@ ories and fat that you may take for a meal , not on to take them in the form of a bold major court or a valuable dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Do not store any medicine for children . • Do not store any medicine after the expi@@ ration date . • Do not exceed 25 ° C . • Do not exceed 25 ° C in order to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ licate nail , which serve to keep the capsules dry .

a permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious ill@@ nesses and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and learn to eat health@@ ily healthy .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ jou@@ les , which you can also find as speci@@ fying on the packaging of food@@ stu@@ ffs . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake speci@@ fies how many cal@@ ories you should take a maximum per day .
note the further down below in this section below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
what amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below which indicates the number of cal@@ ories that are suitable for you .
if you take the same amount of fat as previously , it may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nour@@ ishing accompanying symptoms .
34 These reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously approximately 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you consume only little or at all , stairs , work in the garden or other physical activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and to keep them too . • Sinn@@ ers is a food diary with information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Try to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of further information material that can help you nour@@ ish and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type of weight , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) and chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effic@@ acy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional offering of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , preventing recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received strong or moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ed : prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effic@@ acy of alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding one of the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on age , patients with am@@ n@@ esia care or signs of a sub@@ acute il@@ eus should be closely monitored following the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able in simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or tend to extend the Q@@ t interval or tend to leng@@ then such extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is should neither be used to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical studies Pal@@ oni@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhib@@ ited the activity of the five examined chemotherapy ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ py@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ status concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhib@@ itor .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ induc@@ tors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ inn@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ u@@ zin , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , an@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least potentially associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) have been indicated in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosage groups were observed . no dose effects were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,000 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value period of 4 hours ) or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value period of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intra@@ ven@@ ous on day 1 .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study there were 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m@@ 2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 m@@ g. / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and dos@@ es of 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron reported on day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ous .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials to indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block ion channels in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual dos@@ es of 0.25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) generally are dos@@ is@@ tically proportional to the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es was found between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured according to one intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time release of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated over the ki@@ d@@ neys and other 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in vitro studies on met@@ abo@@ lit@@ ation have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less dimensions , the I@@ so@@ y@@ enz@@ yme C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intra@@ ven@@ ous sti@@ ff injection on healthy subjects the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces , the termin@@ al elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were observed only after exposure to be considered sufficiently on the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a slight relevance for clinical use .
10 of pre @-@ clinical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concent@@ rations of ion@@ ic channels that are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of action .
high dos@@ es of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ oc@@ rine ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id g@@ land , hyp@@ ophy@@ sis , pan@@ cre@@ as , epi@@ thel@@ ial mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is dest@@ ined for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is limited to people .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval for the application of hep@@ atitis C for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C was recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ sensitive ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference drug c@@ ures &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hep@@ atitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
in case of a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damage damage , moreover , the values of the liver enz@@ yme Al@@ an@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was produced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon used data that substanti@@ ate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and p@@ urity of the drug , mode of action , safety and effic@@ acy in hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effic@@ acy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 months of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non @-@ commercial .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the substance and the drug market is not sufficient .
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C reported on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting up the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was used again in more patients than at the reference drug ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study was to examine the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ as ( a skin infection with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ in@@ ths ( cra@@ mp@@ s or s@@ ore s@@ ore ) , di@@ gestion and par@@ aly@@ sis .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for treating infections which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go does not act against this kind of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the skin surface may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient is not addressing the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ome ( the parts of the bacterial enzy@@ mes in which proteins are produced ) and inhib@@ its the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effic@@ acy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was de@@ duc@@ ted after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo said to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin bur@@ ns , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ alex@@ in showed similar response : if the results of both studies were taken together in the skin , about 90 % of both groups were treated to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go has been diagnos@@ ed with the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ars ( iron @-@ filled c@@ avi@@ ties in the body tis@@ sues ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections in relation to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ achment , • infected little la@@ er@@ ations , di@@ gestion or se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission approved the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the distribution of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
the patients with which no improvement occurs within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment has to be removed , the sal@@ mon is carefully bl@@ urred and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for treating infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effic@@ acy of retin@@ ap@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical methods on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concent@@ rations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on scrat@@ ching skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant inhib@@ itor in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After a simultaneous oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin pens to s@@ lic@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dos@@ es are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral consumption and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and f@@ etal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin pens should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ biotic .
the decision whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , is to be weigh@@ ed between the benefits of bre@@ ast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go Therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections caused by Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequent reported side effect irrit@@ ation on the administration was approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance used by fer@@ mentation of C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhib@@ iting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ome , which diff@@ ers from binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding office ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
by binding on this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bit the pep@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of retin@@ ap@@ ulin in at least some infection forms should be question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EU@@ S , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ A@@ UR@@ EU@@ S , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin pens were applied daily under occ@@ lusion to int@@ act and on wr@@ inkl@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin delivery twice a day for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were extra@@ cted .
samples took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of the people according to top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhib@@ itor .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , less than C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chrom@@ osom@@ al effects in the mouse ly@@ mph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chrom@@ os@@ ome effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) .
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were found in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the f@@ etus and delayed intervention ) and mat@@ ern@@ al tox@@ icity .
the owner of approval for the in@@ verter must ensure that a pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system is present , as in the 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) and works before the product is mark@@ eted and used as long as the product is used .
the owner of approval for the In@@ her@@ itance Law is obliged to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance activities , as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP .
as described in the CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for VAT products for human use , the updated R@@ MP should be submitted at the same time with the next peri@@ odic safety update report .
irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area will show you the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak with your doctor .
do not use other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ otions on the surface that will be treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor .
it must not be applied in the eyes , mouth or on lips , in the nose or in female gen@@ ital area .
if the sal@@ ts from seeing on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor to consult your doctor if complaints occur .
after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile association or a Gaz@@ ever@@ band unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface .
it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of sal@@ mon , or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of sal@@ mon .
ambient is applied to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient is applied in the context of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two dos@@ es , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after the second dose .
for this reason Ambi@@ rix may be used only if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and ensures that the vacc@@ ine can be fed into the vacc@@ ine from two dos@@ es .
if a refres@@ her dose is requested for hep@@ atitis A or B , ambient or other hep@@ atitis A or B vacc@@ ine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by helping the immune system ( the natural def@@ enses of the body ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ine approved since 1996 , and the vacc@@ ine approved since 1997 has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rice adults and Twin@@ matrix children are administ@@ ered in the context of a vacc@@ ination plan .
because ambient and Twin@@ matrix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that use the application of Twin@@ matrix adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for effic@@ acy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed protective anti@@ body concent@@ rations after a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a 6 @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
ambient led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children after the last injection to develop protective anti@@ body concent@@ rations against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient ambient was similar to six and at a 12 @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of ambient ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ te defici@@ ency , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ur@@ ness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
ambient may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ biotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission divided the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals AG .
the standardis@@ ed schedule for the pri@@ mei@@ osis with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose will be administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if an inf@@ rin@@ gement is required for hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ine .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ AG ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ bodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hep@@ atitis @-@ A vacc@@ ination may require an inf@@ rin@@ gement as protection as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections vacc@@ ines should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vacc@@ ine .
if a rapid protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardis@@ ed scheme is recommended with the combination vacc@@ ine that contains 360 ELI@@ SA units form@@ al@@ in@@ ine activated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with mal@@ functions of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ PLC anti@@ bodies can be achieved in these cases , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ine can be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ mus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ine success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in cases of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia and blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , ambient , however , can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur after intra@@ mus@@ cular administration .
when ambient was administ@@ ered in the second year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency have to be assumed that there is possibly no sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 imp@@ f@@ d@@ oses of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernity , g@@ astro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine form@@ ulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of ambient with the 3 @-@ dose combination is compared .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination simp@@ lex .
after the complete vacc@@ ination , 66,@@ 4 % of the subjects that had given Ambi@@ rix had been given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination impulse .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable per sample ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ine cycle , at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects that received ambient , compared to 36,@@ 2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ dose combination impulse ) .
the inci@@ dence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to which was observed following the combination of the combination of the 3 @-@ dos@@ es vacc@@ ine .
in a comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ination , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient comparison group was comparable to the associated hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6- and 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambient , a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ inations , which reported severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ dos@@ es @-@ vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dos@@ es @-@ vacc@@ ination schemes with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials that were carried out in vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for Anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for Anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
among the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was evaluated , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ein rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with ambient .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after finishing the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine scheme with ambient or a 3 @-@ dos@@ es vacc@@ ine with a combination of 360 ELI@@ SA units , with a combination of 360 ELI@@ SA units , and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ PLC anti@@ bodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ination scheme .
in this study , immun@@ ity against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the associated hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti@@ bodies anti@@ bodies for 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ine is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of ambient was administ@@ ered in the second year at the same time with the refres@@ her of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ä@@ rem Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ine vacc@@ ine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 dos@@ es of the present form@@ ulation in adults showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for earlier form@@ ulation .
the vacc@@ ine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion by eye candy on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stu@@ ffs and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in waters contam@@ inated by wast@@ ew@@ ater .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( y@@ ellow@@ ish ) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not be completely protected from an infection with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine series has been completed with 2 dos@@ es .
if you are infected with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus , if you are infected with hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you are not feeling ill or ill feel ill / feel ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent illness .
protection against other infections which cause liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of a hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if you have shown an allergi@@ c reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biotic ) .
an allergi@@ c reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin attacks , respir@@ atory or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • if your child has an allergi@@ c reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • if you have a severe infection with fever / your child .
• If you would like to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ine dose ( 360 ELI@@ SA units of a formal in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ine dose of this vacc@@ ine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you vacc@@ ination protection before finishing the vacc@@ ine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is being spra@@ yed with people suffering from severe ble@@ eding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened by a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child is under@@ going a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those persons to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell a doctor if you are taking further medicine / your child ( including those you have received without prescription ) or if you have gotten vacc@@ inated or have been vacc@@ inated or have been planned or planned in the near future .
it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine must be given at the same time with ambient ambient should be vacc@@ inated in separate positions and as various limb@@ s as possible .
if ambient to be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to vacc@@ ine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women will not be given , except it is strongly necessary that they are vacc@@ inated against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix request inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergi@@ c reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible .

on the basis of the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the in@@ verter , the CH@@ MP reported that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remained positive .
however only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ complete enz@@ yme def@@ ective or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high am@@ mon@@ ia concent@@ rations ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps is administ@@ ered - divided into several single dos@@ es to the meals - either mixed with the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ um ( by the abdominal ceiling into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( by the nose in the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps may also lead to appeti@@ te loss , a decreasing aci@@ dity in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , imp@@ urity , fluid retention , stomach ache , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , un@@ pleasant body smell or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ a cycle contributes to high am@@ mon@@ ia levels effectively .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients with which a complete enz@@ yme defici@@ ency has already been manifest@@ ed in the new native age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( in@@ complete enz@@ yme def@@ ective , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first lifetime ) , there is an indication for the use when the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg , as well as for adol@@ escents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest@@ ation of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8@@ g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase defici@@ ency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of oph@@ thal@@ mol@@ ecu@@ le when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate over the liver and ki@@ d@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal trans@@ duction and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a dis@@ ability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during bre@@ ast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least an und@@ esi@@ red event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ at@@ opro@@ dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosage occurred with a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limit@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of dos@@ es up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound associated with gl@@ ut@@ amine with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the ki@@ d@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 Nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable for the elim@@ ination of surplus nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram a so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine Nit@@ rogen .
it is important that diagnosis at an early stage and the treatment will begin immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest@@ ation of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ erior , and the disease led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen elim@@ ination ( so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ ate , so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ ate and so@@ dium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly substitu@@ tion of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first lifetime ) diagnos@@ ed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnos@@ ed during the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it came with many mental dis@@ abilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ical form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e defici@@ ency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated in liver and kidney of gl@@ ut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine .
the concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabolism in plasma and urine have been determined by a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in so@@ dium healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single and repeated gifts of oral dos@@ es of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined for cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ cl@@ usal dis@@ rup@@ tors or hem@@ ost@@ omy di@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable at the next morning after noc@@ turn@@ al fast no phen@@ yl acet@@ ate in plasma .
three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single dos@@ es ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concent@@ rations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic dos@@ es treated rats did not treat c@@ aff@@ ective effects ( study 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules will be taken either in oral ( inf@@ ants and children who do not swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ am or a nas@@ al probe .
after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ ph@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ born babies , babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg , as well as for adol@@ escents and adults .
the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest@@ ation of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8@@ g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit@@ us of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the py@@ rami@@ dion cells of the brain rin@@ de .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ at@@ opro@@ dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 Nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable for the elim@@ ination of surplus value
on the basis of investigations on the elim@@ ination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that for each gram a so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ ate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine Nit@@ rogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate in gran@@ ulate form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate .
during the duration of durability , the patient may not store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spo@@ on contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can be dis@@ solved before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain Leb@@ er@@ enz@@ yme defici@@ encies are missing so that they accum@@ ulate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that are accum@@ ulated after consumption of proteins in the body .
if laboratory exam@@ inations are carried out , you must inform the physician that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ ph@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory exam@@ inations .
if you use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines request , inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS as the medicine can pass into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste disorders , dis@@ advantages of hearing , dis@@ ability , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you find any of these symptoms , you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency care of your hospital for introduction of appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable an@@ gina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - H@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ aly measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose will be administ@@ ered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with an@@ gina or cardi@@ ac inci@@ dence to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox at sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a lock ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ ma@@ b and asp@@ ir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - when preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year overall , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe ble@@ eding , with which it was much more effective than hay .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other her@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it should not be applied in patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is a acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to grant approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile an@@ gina ) / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ ation inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous cle@@ av@@ age of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if in a further row a PCI is carried out , an additional bolt should be given by 0.5 mg / kg and increase in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , after clinical results , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt should be administ@@ ered by 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effic@@ acy of a sole bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is reduced ( ACT after 5 minutes ) , the second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ con@@ stituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administ@@ ered the bol@@ us dose rapidly intra@@ ven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administ@@ ered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restri@@ ction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ o@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second pin dose must be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage occurring in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ira Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be started 30 minutes after finishing the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after finishing the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• well @-@ known sensitivity to active ingredient or other components or against her@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or elevated blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ rever@@ sible de@@ men@@ tia . • heavy @-@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial end@@ oc@@ ardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully supervis@@ ed during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ira is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though in case of PCI patients in bi@@ val@@ o@@ din , most ble@@ eding may occur at arter@@ ial spots , patients receiving a per@@ kut@@ ane cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment in principle everywhere .
in patients who take war@@ far@@ in and be treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after removal of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din returns the level before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ aggreg@@ ation inhib@@ itors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters are regularly checked .
animal experimental investigations are in@@ adequate in relation to the effects of the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , emp@@ t@@ ying or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hib@@ itor and 4@@ 603 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hib@@ itor .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group as well as in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ eding were defined according to Ac@@ u@@ ity and tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ - In@@ hib@@ itor ( see table 2 ) .
a Ac@@ u@@ ity severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ c@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding or ble@@ eding in the pun@@ cture point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood supply , re@@ operation due to ble@@ eding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequent observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations associated with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture sites , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din at 6,@@ 000 patients who under@@ went one PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group as well as in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were listed according to comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed in Table 6 according to system organic categories .
in case of over@@ dose , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of ble@@ eding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis inhib@@ itor , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the Ani@@ bal region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on a t@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part is gradually split by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was associated with ser@@ um of patients in which it was used in the past to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ ble th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( HIT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ira shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if the patients are her@@ ein@@ after a PCI , an additional bolt should be given by 0.@@ 5mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ira and increase in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A the Ac@@ u@@ ity study was administ@@ ered un@@ question@@ n@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable an@@ gina ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhib@@ itor either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high risk factors which required an angi@@ ography within 72 hours , ev@@ enly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ went a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
* Clo@@ pi@@ dog@@ rel before angi@@ ography or before PCI 1 A Ac@@ u@@ ity severe ble@@ eding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ ito @-@ ne@@ al , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding or ble@@ eding in the point of exposure , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ oc@@ ation of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood station , re@@ operation due to ble@@ eding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
the 30 @-@ day results , based on four and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study with over 6,@@ 000 patients under@@ went one PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in Table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients received limited information about the use of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with HIT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ val@@ o@@ din were evaluated in patients who under@@ went a per@@ kut@@ ane cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ira as pep@@ tide is a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid base parts with subsequent recovery of amino acids in the body @-@ pool .
the primary metabolism that results from the split of the Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ termin@@ al sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adol@@ escents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administ@@ ered as a continuous in@@ fusion with ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ate glu@@ cose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot process effectively .
ins@@ ulin lu@@ li@@ osis diff@@ ers very slightly from Human@@ in@@ ulin , and the change means that it affects faster and shorter time than a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies involving 5@@ 72 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for effic@@ acy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin sp@@ ro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra can not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to ins@@ ulin or one of other components or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia .
the dos@@ es of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glu@@ cose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the in@@ convenience of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal ceiling , the th@@ ig@@ h or the del@@ ta can be applied or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abs .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin metabolism , the ins@@ ulin needs to be reduced with a restri@@ ction of the liver function .
any change of effect , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in ins@@ ulin requirements .
3 A insufficient dosage or the breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ ent diabetes can lead to hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change during the transition of the treatment plan .
the substances that increase blood glu@@ cose levels and increase inc@@ lin@@ ation to hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enz@@ yme ( ACE ) inhib@@ itors , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzy@@ mes ( MA@@ O ) inhib@@ itors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ es , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ ph@@ amide anti@@ biotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tic such as beta @-@ loos@@ ening , Cl@@ oni@@ dine , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin may be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ bal@@ ances .
animal experimental studies on re@@ productive tox@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ e- ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sm and human ins@@ ulin regarding pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ etal development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin penet@@ rated into the human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin is not absorbed into the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ b@@ ated according to oral application .

heavy Hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ em@@ es with Con@@ sci@@ ousness can be treated by an intra@@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person or treated by an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ cos@@ m injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypo@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripheral glu@@ cose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be made of ins@@ ulin free of effect occurs faster and shorter time is shorter than hu@@ g@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , ins@@ ulin sensitivity in the therapeu@@ tically relevant met@@ ering range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional increase in glu@@ cose @-@ enhancing effect , and at 0.3 kg / kg or more a proportional rise in glu@@ cose @-@ related effects , just like Human@@ in@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin has twice as fast as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the full glu@@ cose @-@ enhancing effect for about 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
from the data it was apparent that in an application of ins@@ ulin recep@@ tor 2 minutes prior to meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ di@@ al gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal ins@@ ulin which is given 30 minutes prior to meal .
if ins@@ ulin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ ational control was achieved as with human normal ins@@ ulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ulin is used for 15 minutes after the start of the meal , there is a comparable gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control as in human normal ins@@ ulin ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin recep@@ tor for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SI@@ N - before beginning of the meal compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal ins@@ ulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin recep@@ tor at a gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SI@@ N - after ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ in@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MAL - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
