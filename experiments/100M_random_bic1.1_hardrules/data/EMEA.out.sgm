<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid monitoring of stressed unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used or the melting tablets in patients can be used to treat the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are using other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is presumably used as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol contains such as 5-hydroxytrypatamine and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, whereby psychotic or manic symptoms will be reduced and their recovery is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the occurrence of symptoms was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify has been compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo that reacts to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">Efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared with 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo for a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients treated to the treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body resorates the melting tablets and the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented also up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled access), acathic (lack of movement), headache, blurred vision, vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify during the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-heavy to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol talked about the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee also came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of stressed unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission approved the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the inconvenience of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dosage (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of abnormal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the start or after replacement of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of disease associated with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (Myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which are predisposable for hypotony (dehypostasis, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dysfunction during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">In case with Abilify treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia should be dragged to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is why Aripiprazol should be used in patients with seizures in anamnesis or at states that are associated with seizures in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients had treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with cadmium or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk estimates for hyperglycemia related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidity, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">The primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system is advisable if Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central drug effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotides, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective Inhibitoren of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "CYP2D6 'bad' (=" "" "bad" "" ") metabolites can result in higher plasma concentrations of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitoren with Abilify, the potential benefit to outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective Inhibitoren of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteaseinemia, should have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After removing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, Abilify dosage should be lifted to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify, can be calculated with an even increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethamine).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data situation on the subject of safety in humans and due to the concerns associated with the animal, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as also with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total incidence (25.8%) of eps including parkinsonism, acathic, dystonie and dyskinesia compared to patients with haloperidol (57.4%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of eps 19% was under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients with glossy apin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks, the incidence of eps 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of eps 18.2% was for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, where potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of the CPK (creatine phase kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market introduction, unintentional or intentional acute overdose with Aripiprazol were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazol, however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose is beneficial because Aripiprazol has a high plasma rotation.</seg>
<seg id="74">The efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturb the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and an excessive affinity for dopamine D4-, Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergen and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the case of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg. a daily dose of healthy subjects showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11c-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus caudatus and on the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">Data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scale, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depressionsrate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a glossy apin controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.2 kg in an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy over three weeks compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixer dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychoteric characteristics, Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol also proved to be a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychoteric features, which in partially over 2 weeks did not refer to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic Serum, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazol showed a remission against placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in prevention of a return to the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for stretching and hydroxylosis of Aripiprazol, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol in extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours of 'bad' (= "bad ') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics has no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and channel-balanced potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposure, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects are a dose-dependent adnierenrinder-toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10times of the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose at 60 mg / kg / day (10times of the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at recommended maximum dose at the recommended maximum dose.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugments of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times of the recommended daily dose) at recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of the sulphate conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol were not more than 6% of concentrations, which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solution.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed following dosages that led to expositions of the 3- and 11h of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into consideration the medicine used in the treatment or acut therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a secondary treatment with Aripiprazol is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melamine tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders that were different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with bendiazepines in addition to Aripiprazol injection solution should be considered necessary, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol Injection vulnerability are not present for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (caused by missing or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (Myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which are predisposable for hypotony (dehypostasis, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dysfunction during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored regularly regarding the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidity, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">However, the intensity of the Sedation was larger compared to the incidence of Aripiprazol, in a study in which healthy subjects Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) was used as one-off intramuscular medication and the simultaneously Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist Famotides, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metaboard can result in comparison with CYP2D6 extensive metabolites the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitoren of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- proteaseinemia, should have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After removing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, Abilify dosage should be lifted to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) was intramuscular, the intensity of the Sedation was bigger compared to the allure of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were reported in clinical studies using Aripiprazol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical studies (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of eps 18.2% was for patients suffering from Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, where potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of the CPK (Kreatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">To the side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazol injection solution with statistically significant improvements of agility / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement of the initial value on the PANSS Exclusively Component score was 5,8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4-6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of the respondents used to talk to study mediation were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scale, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-DepressionsScale scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the return rate that was 34% in the Aripiprazol (oral) group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.2 kg in an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychoteric features, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazol showed a remission against placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in prevention of a return to the manie.</seg>
<seg id="182">Aripiprazol AUC is in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection 90% greater the AUC after the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time to reaching the maximum plasma levels is 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated gift in a systemic exposure (AUC), which 15- or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies of reproductive toxicity after intravenous application no safety-related concerns were caused by maternal exposure, 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbit) about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) to safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the channel ogenic potential, preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposure, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects are a dose-dependent side-nierenrinder-toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchantal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal carcinomas and combined carcinomas with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugments of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3-fold of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed following dosages which led to expositions of 3 and 11-times of the mean steady state AUC in the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was examined in a major study where 460 women participated in metastatic breast cancer, of which approximately three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any gift or monotherapy) was compared with the drug of a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of 229 with Abraxane treated patients on treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were related to the efficacy-indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were related to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who breastfeeding or before the treatment of low neutrophilic numbers in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Medicinal Committee (CHMP) committee found that Abraxane was found in patients with which the first treatment failed to be more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs and that it has to be given more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission approved the company Abraxis BioScience Limited to grant approval for the transport of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma in patients with which the first-line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline content (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilic count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced in the following series to 220 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3, treatment may break until a improvement to degrees 1 or 2 is reached, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for insufficiency and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which could have much other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not again be treated with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no renewed abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophilic number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Thrombocytes are applied again &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>

<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequent), which can impact on traffic and the ability to serve machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important cases of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma which were treated once every three weeks of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dosisdependent; leukopenia was reported with 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 the side effects are listed in conjunction with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1.000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in blood, increased creatine in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in blood, reduced potassium in blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart diseases:</seg>

<seg id="300">3. the frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in the case in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules agent, which promotes the merging of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depression.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveyed the transzytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the framework of in vitro studies, the presence of Albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transcendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-Albuminreceptor and is based on the albuminbinding protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by the data of 106 patients in two aroused inverbal studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received chemotherapy with paclitaxel, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, as a 3-hour infusion with premediation for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2, as a 30-minute infusion without premeditation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">When recording in the study 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasestels.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are presented below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural process of peripheral neuropathy on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of abraxane after 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, paclitaxel plasma concentration took place in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a wide-ranging extravascular distribution and / or binding binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumors the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolic (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, there are only a few data available about patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron, in which in connection with a blood transfusion could occur if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a bleeding wound, Abseamed is injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, if they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy should always lie in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be controlled before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoic deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and to reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought into the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was administered as an injection in a Vene in the framework of a major study with 479 patients who suffered anaemia caused by kidney problems, compared to the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">At least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a Vene before they were either converted to seamed or still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also put the results of a study in which the effects of Abseamed of Eprex / Erypo were investigated with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemostomy values of patients treated to seamed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients receiving Eprex / Erypo were given an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steching migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems because other studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that for Abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence, the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that establishes Abseamed will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States, including information about the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission approved the company Medice Drugs Pütter GmbH & Co KG to permit approval for the infringement of Abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion necessities in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphomas or multiplem myeloma, who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is given due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned greater operating interventions (4 or more units blood for women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopedic procedure in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected loss of blood from 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous bloodstream programme.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients with which the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and follications may vary depending on age, gender and total disease load; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) should be avoided for a period of four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed over or under the hemoglobin concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value is increased by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the long-lasting hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the etin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance cases than patients with which initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher levels of maintenance than patients with which initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with an increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and subsequent appearing may vary depending on age, gender and total disease load; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number around ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once per week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin descent &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reaction-rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be lifted to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of hemoglobin value by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number around ≥ 40,000 cells / µl should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reaction of the reaction of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood congestion is required, Abseamed should receive in a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight twice a week prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitutes should be started as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donor program will begin to provide large iron reserves before the beginning of the seamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg of epoetin alfa, once weekly about three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa preoperatively preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg must be given at 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic cooking salt solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with some erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not be obtained or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - ythroblastopie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attacks or stroke in a month before treatment, instabile angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamaltic-known venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients treated for a greater elective orthopaedic procedure, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or neutral illnesses: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial closure disease, vascular disease of the cartography or cerebrovascular disease; patients with recently-faithful heart attacks or cerebrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="410">Pathophysiology (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-determined PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of disease defined as reduction of hemostasis (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Retikulocytenis determined and the usual causes for nonresponse (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">The anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined, and if no other reason is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be detected and an investigation of the bone marrow for diagnosing a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous application of seamed to patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 patients with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit shown to the gift of epoetines if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of anaemia symptoms and avoiding blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">It should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">Patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically proven coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which are still not dialyzed, does not accelerate the progression of renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In patients with chemotherapy should be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients that need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetins should be based on a beneficial risk assessment under the involvement of the respective patients, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients treated for a greater elective orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of the epoetin alfa therapy the cause of anaemia is investigated and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopedic procedure should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have increased risk of thrombotic and vasculine diseases, especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be excluded that in case of treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial treatment capacity of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative cymbotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptomatic anemia, or diminish the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received chemotherapy when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was stripped</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose should be adjusted to the increasing hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro investigations of tumour tissue, there are no indications for an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular diseases, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysmen, Retintilis, Retintilis, Retinopathy and Retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An elevated incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independent of erythropoetin treatment may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donation to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically obtained epoetin alfa is glykosiliert and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydrate part identical to the endogenic human erythropoetin isolated from the urine.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells, that Epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoesis and does not influence the leucopocese.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is applied in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including in patients who have recently suffered a traumatic hip fracture like when falling; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) or through injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen (means of inflammation) shortly after the use of Aclasta may reduce the symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">The treatment of the Morbus Paget may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with osteoporosis, and the number of spine and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years that recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures has been examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Acrelia was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared for six months with Risedron (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme called bone substance) decreased in the blood, or decreased at least 75% compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosemedificants) was reduced by 70% compared to the patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosemedics), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">Data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion.</seg>

<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients receiving treatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly recommended for patients with Morbus Paget adequate intake of calcium, correspondingly twice daily at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently developed low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50.000 to 125.000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by the gift of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen in short after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see Section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended because there is limited clinical experience for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Acrelia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data are lacking for insufficiency and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinin clearing &lt; 35 ml / min), as for this patient population only limited clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="600">Prior to the beginning of the therapy with aclasta, a preexisting hypokaline is treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledron acid on the bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hydrase can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly recommended for patients with Morbus Paget adequate intake of calcium, correspondingly twice daily at least 500 mg of vital calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancerary disease, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene) should be considered before applying bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to applying bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of one patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days following administration of Aclasta may be reduced by the gift of acetamol or Ibuprofen in short after application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse side effects reported in patients receiving Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 of 3.862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder, Zoledron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction, associated as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum-creatinins) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted renal function were comparable in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after the gift was observed with 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory fundus, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were, at 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus-Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently obtained hip fracture, the vitamin D mirror were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received vitamin D from the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local responses After the administration of Zoledron acid in a large clinical study was reported on local responses to the infusion centre, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosen in the orthodontic area, especially in cancer patients, about osteonekrosen (primary in the jaw area) reported that with bisphosphonates, including Zoledron acid, were treated.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had indications for local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental implants.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7.736 patients developed osteonecsis in the orthodontic area at a patient with aclasta and with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdosage that leads to a clinically relevant hypokaline, it can be achieved by the administration of orally calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">The aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta sank significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 years and older had reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Acrelia showed a constant effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures reduced by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebraic acid, hips and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 increase of bone density of lumbar vertebral column by 6.7%, the entire hip around 6.0%, the thighs around 5.2% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In case of 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic mud.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTX) in serum were determined in subgroups from 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervall during the study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Acrelia reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the output value and was kept at 28% below the output value to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTX was significantly reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirror were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.E. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">The effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment compared to placebo-treatment compared to placebo-treatment is the BMD at all times and endowels at all points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase of BMD by 5.4% at the total cost and 4.3% on the donation.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta compared to once weekly gift of Alendronate related to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebral BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Acrelia was examined with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum-mirror of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6times to 3,0m of age-specific upper normal value when recording in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledron acid compared to intake of 30 mg risedronat once a day during 2 months was proven in two-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as the study at the end of the six-month study (addressed to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronat treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach was 141 with the patients treated with Aclasta compared with 71 patients treated with crack-treated patients, with a mean duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of continuous infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisless.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level increased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biological disappearing from the large circulation with half-life times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ -146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β) represent the rapid resorption into the bones and the elimination of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h there is 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearing is independent of the dose 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearing of metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledron acid is not metabolized because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearing of Zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-Clearance, and was in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an even kidney dysfunction up to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">For severe kidney dysfunction (creatinin clearing &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letown intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and 0.6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was measured by doses of 0.6 mg / kg than 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals. in dogs a 15-minute infusion of 0.25 mg / kg, administered in interval of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7times of human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in cumulative exposure, which exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common condition in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyde of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, one observed a teratogenicity with dosages from 0.2 mg / kg than external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of reduced serum-calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a representative of a subcategory called bisphosphonates, and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Morbus Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens, which are formed from androgens, play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Morbus Paget the bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is set up unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by restoring bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and gives the bones again strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use aclasta with other medicines request inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines or used recently / applied, even if it is not prescription medication.</seg>

<seg id="749">This paper investigates the impact of non-take-up for two hypothetical scenarios, namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by €100 per month. IAB-Discussion Paper 20 / 2015</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-related diabetes). it can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which Metformin (a diabetesmedication) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be dissatisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylene resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylharmacs or insulin can be maintained with the commencement of the Actos Treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonylharnum and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonic resin, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylic hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which allows the blood sugar levels to be reduced by applying dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonic acid showed 0.94% while the additional offering of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of acetin and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin, reduced the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract (cold), weight gain and hypoesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazon or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoose socket (high glucose level - acid level - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000 the European Commission approved the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to grant approval for the marketing of Actos throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, vaulted, and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the wording "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">The application of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age is not available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest doses dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema, when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study conducted with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrophatic disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study an increase in reports on heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver illness, pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver cell values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as uncleared nausea, vomiting, redness, appetite and / or darker harn, the liver cell values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazon should be continued until the preliminary results of clinical evaluation should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be stirred by fatty deposits and in some cases linked with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction in the mean hemoglobes was reduced (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed when controlled trials with pioglitazon in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and a lower extent also observed in patients with sulphylphosphine and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity there are patients who receive the pioglitazon as oral secondary or triple-combination therapy with a sulphate resin or as a secondary combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the introduction of the treatment with thiazolidindia, including pioglitazon, the incidence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but concordnating physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients talk about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years at the women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive Study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.2%; 1.0 Fractures per 100 patient years) were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes pregnancy or entering it, the treatment is removed (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon the hyperinsulin inhibitor and increased insulin resistance of the parent can be reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgors and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, ALT ascents appeared on triple the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but less less than in comparison groups using metformin or sulfonylene resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outgoing study in patients with advanced macrophatic disease, the frequency of severe heart failure occurred under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than under placebo, when Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the introduction of the market launch, it was rarely reported via heart failure in pioglitazon, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of adverse events with randomised controlled, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients in the group treated with pioglitazon treated with a comparison-mediated group.</seg>
<seg id="796">Data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, after 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-γ (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and the peripheral glucose evaluation in the case of insulin resistance increases.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until aftertreatment of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite a three-month optimization phase with insulin inadequate, to be randomized to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients, which continued only insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin-ratio compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks study on type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction of the overall plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL cholesterol level as well as slightly, clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazon no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol level was observed, while under Metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon was not only the nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved postpranational triglycerides, both on an effect on triglycerides absorption and hepatic triglycerides.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive Study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing makrovascular disease were randomized to receive either Pioglitazon or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazon is quickly resorbished, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazon can be achieved in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV contributes to efficacy in roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marker pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the rot (55%) and a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination radius of unaltered pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than for patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys were consistent with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon inhibits the resulting hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the parent animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), incidences of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium have been induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolid indices led to increased frequency of colonies.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the wording "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years at the women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive Study, a study of 3.5 years for study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.2%; 1.0 Fractures per 100 patient years) were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of Metformin were examined using Pioglitazon or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin-ratio compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon was not only the nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved postpranational triglycerides, both on an effect on the tryglycerid absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was the goal of their primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary reascularization and vascularization of the leg arteries, suggest that there are no cardiovascular risks associated with the intake of pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas could not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes which the body is unable to utilize the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylic hemoglobin (HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in HbA1c Spiegels, suggesting that blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the packaging line).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002 the European Commission approved the company Novo Nordisk A / S a permit for the application of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose adjustment has significantly improved through intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemic warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biaxial, long-acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analogon) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA towards insulin) can cause a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Actraphane, it may be necessary for the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the transition.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycemia were less pronounced or otherwise than with previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before traveling, which pass over several periods of time, the patient should be advised to enter the advice of his physician, as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor has to take into account possible interactions with the therapy and to ask his patients to other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 sodium hypoglycemia, as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Heavy Hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Nervous system diseases - peripherals neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort associated with acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 A intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement of blood sugar adjustment can however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient may not take place after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the Company established data from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">In addition, the company also led a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror had been treated with ADROVANCE, low (11%) than those who took only Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also placed data suggesting that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose prescribed for the prevention of bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus, such as abdominal pain, dyspepsie (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhoe (diarrhoea), diarrhoe (diarrhoea), diarrhoe (diarrhoea).</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or one of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in case of diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium level) or in patients who cannot stand or sit in at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Following indications are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of malignant irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not chew or break the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulceration.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Obsophageal reactions like Ösophagitis, malophageal ulceration and malophageal erosions, rarely followed by malophageal strokes, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partly these severe and required a hospital instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential malignant reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend symptoms of malignant irritation such as dyspagie, pain while swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or deteriorated sodium burn the medicine and get medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malignant side effects seems to be elevated to patients who do not take the medicine correct and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a malignant irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with Alendronat no increased risk, there were rare (after market introduction) gastric and duodenalulzera, including some serious and with complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapies were administered mainly intravenous bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the removal of a bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure, reduces the risk of osteonecsis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">The patients need to be instructed that they should take the tablet to the next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE when taking a dose of ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but taking taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be addressed adequately before the start of therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronat foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplement, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendron if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients need to wait after taking Alendronat at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronat was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without any clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for the application of postmenopausal women and is therefore not suitable for pregnant women during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendron give no indication of directly harmful effects regarding pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecsis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most of the reports come from cancer patients, but also reported in osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum calcium decreased to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2,0 mmol / l) and serum phosphats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Studies with Alendronat The therapeutic quality of Alendronat once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and Alendronat 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in one year multicenter study on postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of Alendronate on bone mass and fracture of postmenopausal women were examined in two Phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and in the Fracture-Interventions- Study (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>

<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronate, a reduction in the placebo group was reduced by 48% (Alendronate 3.2% compared to placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of vertebral column and trochanter continued to maintain; also the BMD of the Femurhale and the whole body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled trials, where Alendronat was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily gift of Alendronat reduced the incidence of at least one new eddy fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% compared to placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption on an intravenous reference dose was 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg. compared to nocturnal fast and two hours before taking a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability increased to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, Alendronat was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the gift of oral Prednisone (20 mg three times daily above five days) resulted in no clinically significant change of the oral bioavailability of Alendronat (increase in the range between 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies of rats showed that Alendronate is distributed temporarily in willow tissue after intravenous gift of 1 mg / kg, but then rapidly distributed into the bones or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Elimination After intravenous gift of a single dose of 14C-Alendronat, about 50% of the radioactive substances were eliminated within 72 hours with the urine and less or no radioactivity was found in the subjects.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this may result in transplant rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub-treatment or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolim formulation and the corresponding daily dose; changing the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of one in the transplantation of experienced doctors (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to alternative formulation, therapeutic drug control and appropriate doses must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacozlimus remains maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of advocate should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and compatibility in individual cases and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">According to the switch from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacozlim Talks should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after transition.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley level, was comparable with both terms of both nicotine and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus bottom mirror are recommended during the first two weeks following transplantation in advance to ensure proper substance exposure in immediate follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing, an adjustment of the advance dose can last several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further doses may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral livagraf therapy should begin with 0,10 - 0,20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose recommendation - Shift from Prograf to Advagraf Must have a Transplantation Transplant twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to once daily intake of livestock, so this conversion in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) is related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation after transition from other immunosuppressiva to livagraf once a day, treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection is to begin.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Cardiac transplantation In adult patients who are converted to livestock, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day must be taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other Transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advocates in pulmonary, pankleas- and transplanted patients, patients in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day and colorectal transplant receptors in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day are applied.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood vessels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function as the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum cancer, a computation of the creatinincineration and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin to Advagraf When converting a Ciclosporine to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the valley level in the whole blood The dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of rejection and compatibility in the individual case under the aid of full blood-Tacrolimus Talks controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent controls of the tacrolimus bottom level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood Talks of Tacrolimus should also be controlled according to the switch from Prograf to advance, dose adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tacrolim whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As advocate is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the bottom level of the blood is 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the bottom level of Tacozlimus in the whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with glands and heartfelt transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receptors, blood concentrations were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including transplant rejection or other side effects, which may occur in succession of Tacrolimus, sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolim formulation and the corresponding daily dose; changing the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of one in the transplantation of experienced doctors (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplant rejection, proven to other immunosuppressiva as therapist, there are still no clinical data for retardized formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant receptors and graft receptors in childhood age there are no clinical data for retardized formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus mirror in the blood and a weakening of the clinical efficacy of Tacozlimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the currant (Hypericum perforatum) contains, or other plant extracts during treatment with aspirin (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Taconic concentrations in the blood has been given, since the Tactic Blood mirror may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under the program a cardiomyopathy was observed to observe chamber or septum hypertrophies which can therefore also occur under advance.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluids and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressiva, sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunshield with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacozlimus, symptoms of PRES such as headache, altered states of consciousness, crampings and visual disturbances should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase the blood values of tacrolimus and decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus's blood levels while controlling the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacozal dose to maintain regular concentrations accordingly (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies resulted in the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacozlimus, due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal extension.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly-dozed prednisolon or methylprednisolon, as it is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of Tacozlimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolim with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is impaired.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus descend the clearing of steroid contraceptives and thereby increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures should be particularly careful.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazon and can extend their half-value.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of tests on transplant patients provide no indication that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressiva a higher risk for undesirable events in terms of the course and the outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with Tacrolimus in form of twice daily applied program capsules after other primary organ transplantations (Prograf) developed into a recognised primary immunosuppressant for pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplantations.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 patients, who underwent a pancreatic transplant and in 630 patients were used after transplantation as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">In total, the safety profile of oral program in these published studies showed the observations in the major studies in which Prograf was used for the primary immunosuppression of liver, kidney and heart transplant receptors.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentric study with oral program was reported via 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">A chronic transplant rejection, the bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was often observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.8% in the Tacrolium and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with Tacrolimus were reported in 21.7% of cases for the formation of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0,02) than the number of patients treated by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lunging patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the frequency of the formation of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndroms in the patients treated with Tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicentric study with oral program was performed at 205 patients who received a pancreatic and kidney transplantation according to a randomised trial of Tacozlimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired bottom level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colorectal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral program as primary immunosuppressive (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multivarious transplantations) showed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infection, bone marrow enlargement, additional gift of the interleukin-2-antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to Talks between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocritory and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of Tacozlimus, or by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can conclude that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before the elimination, whereby the excretion is mainly carried out via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In case of stable patients treated by Prograf (twice a day) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) related to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacozlimus (AUC0-24) was below 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used for treating and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII-related, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application are directed to whether the Advantages are applied to the treatment of bleeding or for prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes bleeding problems like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought into the formation of the human nerve factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is a medication approved in the European Union called Recombinate, similar, but is produced differently, so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advantages in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood tests with "excellent" or "good" is assessed.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of aspirin (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be applied in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) against the human nerve factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the incorporation of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the severity of the factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII-activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, a suitable determination of the factor VIII-plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, which have different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitory values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be voiced.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Depending on the patient's condition, the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatorische activity of factor VIII, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlated with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 expositions is the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositional layers and anamaltic-known inhibitors, after transition from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, reformation of (low titration) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences in the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitoren against factor VIII (5 patients), which have a higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, CHMP has still considered a positive assessment, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">For this reason, CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which is required for a submission of PSURs all 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for additional extensions in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company adopts its application for the application of Advantin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1645">The p53 protein which is formed from non-defective genes in the human body, usually contributes to recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study with a patient before, with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of substrate, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company on which questions asked him, there were still some questions.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the exam of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP handwritten 120 a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP's opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advantin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that the Advantages can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company was not aware of the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "Compassionate use" programs.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergy rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy against pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents over the age of 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be followed by constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever, which were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms, the patients receiving aerinaze reported a decrease of the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35,9% in patients who received pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, patients showed a relief of the symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardie (heart jages), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotoric hyperactivity (impairment), anorexia (impairment), somnolence (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Desloratinate, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a botanical glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroid) or hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrosis) or a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a hemorrhagic stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission approved the company SP Europe approving approval for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, to swallow the whole (i.e. without crushed or crushed).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerobic should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application period to 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can be taken off with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephedrin contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidation (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after finishing such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, dihydrogenotamine or other deongestives (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data are not sufficient to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data are not sufficient to pronounce appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment in incidence of hypertension or tachometer or of palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck construction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests because antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or to reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">During clinical trials with Desloratadin where erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of psychomotor tests, no significant differences could be observed between the patients with Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratinate was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin is not inhibited in vivo CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaosis during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Because reproduction studies of animals are not always transferred to humans, and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrin, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases, which may lead to an impairment of traffic noise or the ability to serve machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a ZNS-depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental attention, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, treble, convulsions) with potential letterways.</seg>

<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, like atropin-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupillary starch and dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion promoter P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">A single dose-study with adults showed Desloratadin 5 mg no influence on standard measuring sizes of the fluidity, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergy rhinitis, with 414 patients received aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-agonist efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerobic tablets in terms of the decreasing effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin via the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobic in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow rate of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydeslauatadin and pseudoephedrin was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were badly displaced.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrin after the allay gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was used for exposure to the gift of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated gift, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin can detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproducible icological studies, the combination of Loratadin and pseudoephedrin was the oral gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), oral dryness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients aged 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect of headache was treated with 5.9% of the patients treated with Desloratadin and with 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion promoter P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as nicotine, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergy rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persian rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall model of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is noteworthy of aetiology in different forms, and chronic patients can be recalled easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histaminfant is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that Desloratadin is also associated with other forms of urticaria to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients not responded to antihistamines from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of itching over 50% was observed with 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disruption of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, which was comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergistic Rhinitis population, a higher concentration of Desloratadin was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indication for a clinically relevant cumulation after once daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratinate was not identified, so interactions with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The pre-clinical trials presented with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed a comparable degree of the exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the Toxicity Test of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have been metabolized by Desloratadin and have a higher substrate load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years is identical with the children who metabolize normal metabolic processes.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption, or saccharase Isomal-insufficiency do not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinical relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, Aerius tablets and alcohol may not amplify the effectiveness of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose of 3% was reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with which up to 45 mg Desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years, which came into question for an antihistamine therapy received a daily dose-dose of 1.25mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic Urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin can be extrapolated by adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In case of a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials have no impact on psychomotor skills.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. of the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) officially announced that the company adopts its application for infringement of Aflunov for the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu epidemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread by humans, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as a "foreign body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">In this way, the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane shell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognises human body as a foreign body) is purified, purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">In this way, the extent of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of EMEA for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you want more information regarding CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral drugs for treating adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immune deficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for insertion, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should first be prescribed if the doctor has checked the antiviral medication of the patient before, and the likelihood of the virus has to be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years amounts to 600 mg twice a day, which will be taken together twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose depends on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the HIV-amount of blood in combination with other antiviral drugs in combination with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids are not healed, however, however, the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS related infections and illnesses can be hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was used in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who were previously treated with proteasers.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, with low dosified Ritonavir increased medicine has been compared with 206 adults who had previously taken proteasinhibitors, compared to other proteasers.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">After 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced viral load, but the children who had previously been treated with proteastia were very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteasinhibitors, the treatment associated with Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other proteasinhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitors, it came together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the virus last after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previous proteasers:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Amprenavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines which are just as amethase and are in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase take the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovery immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">In general, Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee concluded that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who did not have a proteasformer have not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally admitted to" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000 the European Commission divided the company Glaxo Group Limited to grant approval for the transport of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for treating HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boosting of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance musters and pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for insertion is 14% smaller than of Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution to absorb a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg Amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of acid (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasinhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data to inconceivable and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction should be reduced twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">In patients with severe liver function, they are contraindicated in patients with severe liver function disorder (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isodium 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations that contain the Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir during taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver disease with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis indicate a higher frequency of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucoco-coids, which are confused over CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of systemic corticoeroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor of Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Normalisation Ratio), methods for determination of the active substance concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is insufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If Methadon is given at the same time with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for Opiatment symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this presentation form is contraindicated for children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be placed in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms can be accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including proteasinhibitors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or a hereditary of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses that were necessary for their treatment medications which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hämophiles patients (type A and B) treated with proteastia are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous haematocytes and haematodes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">HIV-infected patients with severe immunity may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial ethearology (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecsis were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude Agenerase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isodium 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic latitude Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be used together with medicines whose active substances are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin is a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very common adverse effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">JOHANNISKRAUT (Hypericum perforatum) The Serum mirror of Amprenavir may be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with currant (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient takes Johanniskraut, the Amprenavirus mirror and, if possible, to check the virus last and remove the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased for CMAx by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) combined with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg Amprenavir twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, which substantiate the efficacy and harmlessness of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreases if Amprenavir (750 mg twice a day) combined with Caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with Caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice a day) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study used in combination with didanosin, but due to the antagonist component of Didanosin, it is recommended that the income of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice a day) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day), no dose adjustment is required twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended because the exposure of both proteasefans would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteasinhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin is possibly lowering the Serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in adverse side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is to be administered together with Agenerase, a reduction in dosage of rifabutin will be recommended at least half of the recommended dosage although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamphetavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-THC) to the 2,69 times compared to the value, which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazol once a day without simultaneous use of Fosampentavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4, can potentially lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions, which are linked to these medicines, if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasinhibitors it is advisable that Antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva, known as enzymers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with Amprenavir can lead to a reduction of the plasma levels of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blowers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Nifedipine, Nifedipine, Nifedipine and Verapamil can be increased by Amlodipine, Nifedipine and Verapamil, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous taking with agenerase can increase their plasma concentrations considerably and amplify with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with side effects including hypotension, vision disorders and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg flusis propionate intranasal (4 times a day) more than 7 days of subjects were given, the fluorescent propionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90%) interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose correlation is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases of plasma levels while administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a habdomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror, since plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of ambavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with oral midazolam (see section 4.3), while at simultaneous use of agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseinomy inhibitors indicate a possible rise in plasma levels by Midazolam um 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered together with Amprenavir, the patient should therefore be monitored for Opiatment symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low permeability of historical comparison, no recommendation can be given, such as the Amprenavir- dose, when Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In case of simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase a increased control of the INR (International standardization ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or strengthening of antithrombotic action (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended in simultaneous administration of agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be applied after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for foetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lacrimal rats, Amprenavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether Amprenavir passes into mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the injunction in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding time, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight in the descendants.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the descendants, including the fertility and reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The incubation of Agenerase was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly elevated to moderate, occurred early and often led to treatment break.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are associated with the intake of agenerase or another at the same time to HIV treatment or whether they are a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where patients with proteastia did not receive 1200 mg of agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study mediation and in more than 1% of the patients, as well as under the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophie) in HIV patients, including loss of peripherical and fazial skin fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral infections, which were treated with ambavir in combination with lamivudin / Zidovudin for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">The study PROAB 3006 appeared at 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) at 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin extracts were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makuloidal nature, with or without itching and stepped up spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to break the treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecsis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defective, it can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of agenerase twice a day with low dosified rionavir (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (grade 3 and 4) to those who were observed under sole Agenerase treatment; an exception formed enhancements of triglycerid and CPK values that were received in patients who received agenerase together with low dosified Ritonavir were very common.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinformation with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronic lymphoma cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is located in the range of 0.0012 to 0.008 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in case of chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral infections associated with the currently approved Fosamphoravir / Ritonavir dosages, the mutations described in other Ritonavir were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral infections, which received 700mg Fosamphoravir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred until week 48, with 14 isolates could be studied.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the Isolate of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure occurred within the 59, with proteasinhibitors did not appear to pretreated patients, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, K20R, V32I, M46I, M46V, I50V, I54L, I62V, I84V, I84V, I84V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I84V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V, I85V</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg. of Fosamphoravir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107), patients with virological failure occurred in patients with virological failures for over 96 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypical resistance tests based on genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamphoravir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasformer resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fossiamphoravir / Ritonavir defines resistence as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, I62V, V82A / C / F, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased chance of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based analysis clinically validated phallic interpretations can be applied in conjunction with the genotypical data for estimating the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamphoravir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasformer resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistances have developed clinically-photypical cut-offs (release points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir associated genetic pattern produces a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently dates for crude resistance between Amprenavir and other proteasers for all 4 Fosamphoravir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral antiretroviral treatment (one of them indicated a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir (three of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasers resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early outbreak of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations occurring in the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI pretreated adults according to virological failure (100 mg twice a day) and Nuklematitis (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with a low dosified Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the plasma load (HIV-1-RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-loss threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase solution for taking and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low doses were given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) along with Agenerase approved NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients concluded a plasma-HIV-1-RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered" "" "ungeboostertem" "" "with PI pre-treatment children who are expected to be expected." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the medium duration (tmax) amounts to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was administered twice daily with Amprenavir (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of Amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, with the amount of unbound Amprenavir, which remains the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration remains constant, the percentage of the free active ingredient is constant during the dosage interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicine must induce or inhibits CYP3A4 or pose a substrate of CYP3A4, administered with caution when they are given at the same time (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily ambavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from the solution 14% less biocompatible than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammes basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearing of Ritonavir is also negligible. therefore, the effect of a kidney dysfunction should be minimal at the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to ambavir plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on rabbits with Amprenavir on mice and rats, hepatzelluläre Adenoma occurrences in dosages that correspond to the 2.0 times (mice) or 3.8- times (rats) of exposure to humans, after twice daily offering of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocell Adenoma and carcinoma was not yet informed and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, there was little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations were involved in human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutually nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant hepatic toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of agenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies of toxicity in young animals, which were treated from a age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in the inspection and with Amprenavir treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure among therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and light skeletal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of acid (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its efficacy (by examining its effectiveness in relation to the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, the GAG concentrations in urine were about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of alduracyms in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthroathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardie (accelerated heart rate), fever and shooter frost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Alduracea may not be applied to patients who may be highly sensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, check and update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of alduracyms will receive patients who receive alduracyms regarding reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission approved the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the distribution of alduracyms throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovvary, egg stock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with diagnosed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with alduracyms should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient tolerates this, every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of alduracea in adults over 65 years has not been established, and for these patients no doses scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of alduracea in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established, and for these patients no doses scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effects associated during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically, these patients should also be monitored closely meshed, and the infusion of alduracyms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment in which revitalizing devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with care (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a prolonged interruption, the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautious after interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretika) to minimise the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or medium-severe infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduced infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused to decrease treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Alduracyms should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or PROCAINE because a potential risk of interference with intracellular acceptance of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exponated compared to Laronidase over breast milk, is recommended to breastfeeding with alduracyms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical studies were mainly prescribed as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions associated with alduracyms, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, severe reactions occur, including bronchospasm, breaststroke and facial öder (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with alduracyms, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with mainly severe distortion and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous all 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, within 3 months after the treatment was converted to a serotapa, it usually occurred within a month after a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radioimmunopräitation (RIP) assortable antibodies, among them 3 patients with whom it was never to Serocont.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of antibody mirror showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, while patients with high antibodies had a variable reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronia activity in vitro, which seemed to impair the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies didn't seem to be associated with the incidence of undesired drug reactions, although the occurrence of undesired drug reactions typically fell together with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate restoration of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circuit and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely on Mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of alduracyms were analyzed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Alduracea each week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldural patients treated with the placebo group to improve lung function and the ability to gaze in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the alduracyms / alduracyms group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / alduracyms group, as shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volume increased further proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks there was a significant decrease in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous manifestation between the patients treated by using a combined end point, clinically significant changes were observed for five efficacy variable (expected proctional normal FEV, course in 6-minute walking test, movement range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazuyms were examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the severe distortion form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe slowdown form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development rate, whereas in the older patients with severe distortion-shape only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, investigations were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous all 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenous all 2 weeks can be a substitute alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two doses schemas is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with Cisplatin and in patients who have previously received chemotherapy for previously other chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and get injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with Cisplatin before or after the gift of Cisplatin, an "antiemetics" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid deficiency) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood cells change or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be pushed up, decreases or decreases the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetry is thus slowed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetal cells into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease were compared with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabin (a further medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetal stimulation, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy process as well as for further 21 days after the last Pemetrexedal dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) during the week before the first pemetric dose as well as after each third operation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetry, a complete blood screen should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanin transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose-examination must take place, taking consideration of the nadirs of the blood balance or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of predicting therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients need to be treated according to the critics in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applied to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grad 2 Blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop haematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 doses-reducers, a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so forth in the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that patients aged 65 years or more compared to patients aged 65 years were an increased side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials in patients with a creatinin clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, no doses of doses were necessary, which go beyond the doses recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatinin clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-times of the upper bilical values and / or transaminases of the upper boundary value (at Ab- Being of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) were not specifically examined in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be supervised with regard to the bone marrow, and pemetal cells may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophilic value has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- zytenfold has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute Neutrophilic number, trombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as it has been observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and nichthelimatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia became obscous when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients with pemetal treated patients need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate kidney failure (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) have to avoid simultaneous intake of non steroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyrlic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and mindi- and 2 days after therapy with pemetal detection (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for therapy with telemetry must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-value period for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetal corrections (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who occurred these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transgenic space, a drainage of the ergometer should be considered in front of the telemetry treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with pemeteries, if this active ingredient is usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated lifetime vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversible hardening of reproductive capacity by pemetry, men should be pointed out before the treatment plant should be advised to obtain advice on the sperm conservation process.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non steroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) lead to reduced pemetal elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) are used high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and mindi- or 2 days after therapy with Pemetal defects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-value time such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of telemetry must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre-.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the nervous system during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulstimulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International standardization ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetry in pregnant women, but as with ande-, antimetabolished, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetry may not be used during pregnancy, except if absolutely - and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of reproductive capacity by pemetry, men should be advised before the start of treatment, consult with regard to the sperm congestion.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, alli was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received alli 60 mg after a year showed an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss was observed for patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily spots on after, Flatus (Winde) with bowel finish, bowed strand, oily / oily chair, departing oily secretion (winches), flatulence (wind) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients dealing with ciclosporin (for preventing organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin for prevention of blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (which does not contain enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or to cholesterol (liver disease), and in pregnant or nursing mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be applied in conjunction with a lightweight hypokalorphic, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18, as insufficient data is available for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since Orlistat is only minimal resorbated, the dosage is necessary for elderly and in patients with limited liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or one of other ingredients • Premature treatment with ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Cholestase • Pregnancy (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can occur with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before the start of treatment with alli a doctor or pharmacist because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines must be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to meet additional pregnant prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of Orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with Orlistat, the Quick-Values (international normative ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with orlistate remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotins in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamins intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the gift of a disposable dose Amiodaron was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received Orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease of the Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of Orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal flora and related with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were measured from clinical studies with Orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency ranges are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1.000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on the available data).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects noted after the market launch of Orlistat is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">It is plausible that treating allergies with alli can lead to potential or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg. of orlistate and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported by Orlistat overdose, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals it is possible to proceed from a rapid reformation of any systemic effects caused by the lipasthous characteristics of Orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect continues in the lumen of the stomach and the upper thin intestine by covalent bonding to the active serin rest of the gastrischen and pankic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical trials, 60 mg of orlistate was taken three times a day to block the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 substantiate the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistate which was taken three times a day in combination with hypokaloric, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the alteration of the body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the study course (Table 1) and as part of the study participants that lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average changes in the LDL cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with Orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable in 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, therapeutic dosages could not be metabolized in the plasma only sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving adipous patients with which the minimal systemic resorbated dose was administered, two main metabolic processes were identified, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyophized Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-Leucine Group), which presented approximate 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin) and chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional offering of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), preventing receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting showed 59% of patients treated with Aloxi, in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indiscrimined: prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding one of the corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon age, patients with amnesia care or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored following the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable in simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or tend to extend the Qt interval or tend to lengthen such extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies Paloniosetron inhibited the activity of the five examined chemotherapy (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cyclopyin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-status concentration oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis, pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6-inductors (Amiodaron, Cinnoxib, chlorprouzin, dioxetine, paroxetine, antraline and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (total 633 patients), which were at least potentially associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to administration location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) have been indicated in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosage groups were observed. no dose effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective in an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,000 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide, and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron (half-value period of 4 hours) or 100 mg dolasetron (half-value period of 7.3 hours) were given intravenous on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study there were 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg. / m2 Cyclophosphamide and doses of 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron with patients receiving 32 mg of Ondansetron reported on day 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials to indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block ion channels in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of the Palonosetron in individual doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) generally are dosistically proportional to the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses was found between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured according to one intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time release of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated over the kidneys and other 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolitation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in less dimensions, the Isoyenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous stiff injection on healthy subjects the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver function disturbances, the terminal elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron is increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects were observed only after exposure to be considered sufficiently on the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a slight relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of pre-clinical studies suggest that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ionic channels that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about the 30times of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily for two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, hypophysis, pancreas, epithelial mark) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high dosages and since Aloxi is destined for one-time application, the relevance of these results is limited to people.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval for the application of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug-sensitive ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference drug cures").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was produced, which stimulates this to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon used data that substantiate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 months of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the substance and the drug market is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C reported on the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was used again in more patients than at the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study was to examine the extent to which the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impeas (a skin infection with crust formation) and small infected lainths (cramps or sore sore), digestion and paralysis.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for treating infections which have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo does not act against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the skin surface may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not addressing the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosome (the parts of the bacterial enzymes in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was deducted after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo said to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin burns, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response: if the results of both studies were taken together in the skin, about 90% of both groups were treated to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo has been diagnosed with the treatment of abscars (iron-filled cavities in the body tissues) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo during short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks: • Impeachment, • infected little laerations, digestion or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission approved the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the distribution of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients with which no improvement occurs within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitizing or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment has to be removed, the salmon is carefully blurred and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for treating infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinapulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical methods on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on scratching skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibitor in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a simultaneous oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazol increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% retapamulin pens to sliced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, doses are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin pens should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, is to be weighed between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of Altargo Therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections caused by Altargo, the most frequent reported side effect irritation on the administration was approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance used by fermentation of Clitopilus passagerianus (formerly Pleurotus passagerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50S subunit of the bacterial Ribosome, which differs from binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding office ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and located in the region of the ribosomal P-Bindungsstelle and the PeptidyltransferaseCentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptide transfer, partially block P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retinapulin in at least some infection forms should be questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.AUREUS, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.AUREUS, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults 1% retapamulin pens were applied daily under occlusion to intact and on wrinkled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% retapamulin delivery twice a day for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were extracted.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before mediation and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of the people according to topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, less than CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro investigation on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in-vivo study chromosome effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were found in oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed intervention) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for the inverter must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system is present, as in the 1.8.1 of the application application (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed and used as long as the product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of approval for the Inheritance Law is obliged to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for VAT products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time with the next periodic safety update report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area will show you the application of Altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface that will be treated with Altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or on lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the salts from seeing on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor to consult your doctor if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazeverband unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of salmon, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of salmon.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambient is applied to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient is applied in the context of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason Ambirix may be used only if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccine can be fed into the vaccine from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is requested for hepatitis A or B, ambient or other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by helping the immune system (the natural defenses of the body)," "" "how it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the virus and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996, and the vaccine approved since 1997 has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used for protection against the same diseases, but Twinrice adults and Twinmatrix children are administered in the context of a vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambient and Twinmatrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that use the application of Twinmatrix adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed protective antibody concentrations after a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a 6-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient ambient was similar to six and at a 12-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of ambient (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, appetite deficiency, pain on the injection point, redness, maturness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission divided the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals AG.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardised schedule for the primeiosis with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose will be administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If an infringement is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAG) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis-A vaccination may require an infringement as protection as they may also be protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections vaccines should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardised scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalinine activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with malfunctions of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HPLC antibodies can be achieved in these cases, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccine can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccine success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In cases of thrombocytopenia and blood clotting disorders, ambient, however, can be injected subcutaneous as it can occur after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambient was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immunodeficiency have to be assumed that there is possibly no sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 impfdoses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thiomer sal- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of ambient with the 3-dose combination is compared.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and maturness on a calculation basis per vaccine dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3-dose combination simplex.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination, 66,4% of the subjects that had given Ambirix had been given, over pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects that were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination impulse.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable per sample (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle, at 39.6% of the subjects that received ambient, compared to 36,2% in the subjects that received the 3-dose combination impulse).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pronounced pain and maternity was low and comparable to which was observed following the combination of the combination of the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year-old vaccination, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient comparison group was comparable to the associated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- and 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with ambient, a common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccinations, which reported severe adverse events during the 2-doses-vaccines with Ambirix or during the 3-doses-vaccination schemes with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalinininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out in vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years, the Seroconversions for Anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversions for Anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2764">Among the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the Seroprotein rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with ambient.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1-11-year-olds one month after finishing the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccine scheme with ambient or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units, with a combination of 360 ELISA units, and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HPLC antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">In this study, immunity against both antigens was comparable to the associated hepatitis B-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and antibodies antibodies for 24 months after immunization in 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambient was administered in the second year at the same time with the refresher of a combined Diphtherie-, Tetanus-, azellulärem Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar Seroprotective and Seroconversions as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the restitution by eye candy on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you vaccination protection before finishing the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is being sprayed with people suffering from severe bleeding disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • if you are weakened by a disease or treatment in your / her body's own defense, or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient can be given in these cases, but the immune response of those persons to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell a doctor if you are taking further medicine / your child (including those you have received without prescription) or if you have gotten vaccinated or have been vaccinated or have been planned or planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambient ambient should be vaccinated in separate positions and as various limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambient to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2810">Ammonaps may also lead to appetite loss, a decreasing acidity in blood, depression, irritability, headache, impurity, fluid retention, stomach ache, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body smell or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle contributes to high ammonia levels effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in the new native age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defective, which manifests itself after the first lifetime), there is an indication for the use when the Anamnese consists of hyperammonic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated using protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of Natrium phenylbutyl rate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg, as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifestation of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine uccinatsynthetase deficiency must be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of ophthalmolecule when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal transduction and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at 56% of patients at least an undesired event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactatoprodose, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosage occurred with a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound associated with glutamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 Nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable for the elimination of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram a sodium phenylbutylate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine Nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis at an early stage and the treatment will begin immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifestation of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inferior, and the disease led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticking-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen elimination (sodium benzoate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl acetate), protein reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in post-partal (however within the first lifetime) diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it came with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygical form of the Ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonic encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney of glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyate and its metabolism in plasma and urine have been determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in sodium healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, the hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis after single and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also examined for cancer patients after intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenyl acetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutylate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cyclusal disruptors or hemostomy diopathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable at the next morning after nocturnal fast no phenyl acetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyate treated with toxic and non-toxic doses treated rats did not treat caffective effects (study 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules will be taken either in oral (infants and children who do not swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a Gastrostomieschlam or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">After previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of Natriumphylbutyl rate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborn babies, babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg, as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifestation of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram Natrium phenylbutyate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When Rattenflutes were exposed before the birth of phenyl acetate (active metabolitus of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramidion cells of the brain rinde.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactatoprodose, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 Nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable for the elimination of surplus value</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the elimination of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle it can be assumed that for each gram a sodium phenylbutylate can be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine Nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyl rate in granulate form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient may not store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain Leberenzyme deficiencies are missing so that they accumulate the nitrogen-containing waste products that are accumulated after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory examinations are carried out, you must inform the physician that you are taking AMMONAPS as Natriumphylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you use AMMONAPS with other medicines request, inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding period, you may not take AMMONAPS as the medicine can pass into the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disorders, disadvantages of hearing, disability, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find any of these symptoms, you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency care of your hospital for introduction of appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hung" (an anomaly measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients receiving a PCI, a higher dose will be administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or cardiac incidence to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox at sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a lock), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - when preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or a year overall, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, with which it was much more effective than hay.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other herudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It should not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is a acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to grant approval for the transport of Angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile angina) / non-ST-midation infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous cleavage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If in a further row a PCI is carried out, an additional bolt should be given by 0.5 mg / kg and increase infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, after clinical results, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt should be administered by 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a sole bolus gift of Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is reduced (ACT after 5 minutes), the second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the bolus dose rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that are subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalodin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second pin dose must be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage occurring in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalira Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, Angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be started 30 minutes after finishing the intravenous gift of unquestionable Heparin or 8 hours after finishing the subcutaneous gift of low molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known sensitivity to active ingredient or other components or against herudine • active bleeding or elevated blood risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible dementia. • heavy-controlled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully supervised during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding, especially when Bivalira is administered in combination with another anticoagulan (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though in case of PCI patients in bivalodin, most bleeding may occur at arterial spots, patients receiving a perkutane coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment in principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who take warfarin and be treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International standardization ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after removal of the treatment with bivalirudin returns the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytic or thrombocyte aggregation) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocytenaggregation inhibitors or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostatic parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to the effects of the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, emptying or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudin Group as well as in patients treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to Acuity and timi standards for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / III- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">A Acuity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture point, reduction of hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known blood supply, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequent observed blood localizations associated with more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture sites, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bivalirudin at 6,000 patients who underwent one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin Group as well as in the comparative groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were listed according to comprehensive application in practice and are grouped in Table 6 according to system organic categories.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, treatment with bivalirudin can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombosis inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic centre and the Anibal region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or on a tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to Thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on its part is gradually split by Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin was associated with serum of patients in which it was used in the past to heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininducible thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no thrombocyte aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients Bivalira shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patients are hereinafter a PCI, an additional bolt should be given by 0.5mg / kg of Bivalira and increase infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A the Acuity study was administered unquestionnated Heparin or Enoxaparin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of angiography (at the time of randomization) or in the PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin luliosis differs very slightly from Humaninulin, and the change means that it affects faster and shorter time than a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving 572 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra has been studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance glycosylic hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin spro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra can not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or one of other components or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission approved the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the inconvenience of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal ceiling, the thigh or the delta can be applied or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abs.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin needs to be reduced with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of effect, the brand (manufacturer), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or the breakdown of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulent diabetes can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the transition of the treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase inclination to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzymes (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, Propoxyphes, Salizylate and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytic such as beta-loosening, Clonidine, Guanethidin and Reserpin may be weakened or missing the symptoms of adrenergic counterbalances.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insue- linglulism and human insulin regarding pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin penetrated into the human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into the breast milk, nor is it resorbated according to oral application.</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophie is failing to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy Hypoglycemes with Consciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person or treated by an intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucosm injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous Ga- be made of insulin free of effect occurs faster and shorter time is shorter than hug- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutically relevant metering range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase in glucose-enhancing effect, and at 0.3 kg / kg or more a proportional rise in glucose-related effects, just like Humaninulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucose-enhancing effect for about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin receptor 2 minutes prior to meal a comparable post-prandial glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes prior to meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranational control was achieved as with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is used for 15 minutes after the start of the meal, there is a comparable glycemic control as in human normal insulin (see Figure 1).</seg>
