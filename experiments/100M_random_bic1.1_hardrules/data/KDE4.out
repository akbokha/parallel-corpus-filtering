you can translate the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Tools website . select the initial and target language of the translation from the list .
if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated as part of the entire &amp; URL ;
automatic translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case . therefore , the translations do not make important decisions depending on the translation .
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page yourself , where you can insert translated texts directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier to use .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Add @-@ in extensions .... Open the map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
in order to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras . then you can view the page , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes when present , delete .
the module view filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools view filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to view the DOM tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DOM tree ... and therefore open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root no@@ des of the document , for example : design element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views , in order to view the content of your local file system .
each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; the size of a file or folder is mir@@ r@@ ored , with the size of a folder as the sum of the entries in it . this way , large files , even then easily recognized when they are located far below in the folder hier@@ archy . therefore , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; an entry in the Tre@@ e@@ Map display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over color mode can be either depth for the light detection of the sh@@ ading depth or the image of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be created with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if sufficient space is available , or if the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( and thus display errors due to limitations of the Tre@@ e@@ Map ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps it should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ e@@ Map in &amp; fs@@ view ; this goal is not always respected .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries will be left to the implementation . here it is possible for the labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to the context that rect@@ angles are created which are as square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can specify the minimum order area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a pattern pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ ordered order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; fs@@ view ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
if you call the module gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; of course every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast editing tool with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plugin interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 bit colour gam@@ ut and all available modules support the conversion through li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ Export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more met@@ adata such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens that can be sought .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s reli@@ ant on the support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the mel@@ ding of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains one entry problems or wishes .... This opens a dialog with a signed link . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to answer any questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; and hopefully you will soon be able to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be more powerful in this mailing list .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to learn about fre@@ ed versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the file name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ brevi@@ ation is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ Library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the upper@@ most folder that contains images as a base folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; thir@@ st re@@ kur@@ siv the library path throughout the depth . you can &apos;t exclu@@ de sub@@ folders unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to insert extra@@ di@@ aries &amp; digi@@ kam ; by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List have no photos as symbols . you can change the change by taking any photo from the album and lay it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up your digital camera ; then you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported cru@@ x cameras in the help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h de@@ coder settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; of course every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos generally are large files and transfers over the serial port , this connection is out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so the preview images of digi@@ bar can be read out reliably . if the thumbnail support does not exist in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see pre@@ views or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to digi@@ kam is how easy to expand its functionality through modules :
ki@@ pi module : the K@@ DE Image plugin Interface Project ( Manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all the graphics programs . the settings for the ki@@ pi modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , and digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change the full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and laying images works everywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only restri@@ ction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , data list or searching .
- a data type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the fil@@ ename works on the file name only if this ind is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ e ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos provided by &amp; digi@@ kam ; are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folder where they are stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ches or after the date on which the album has been created first , sorted by the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Imp@@ orted images . you can also scan a screens@@ hot directly to an album . choose album Imp@@ orting screens@@ hot .
to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . you can move or copy the image by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click on the album and select the album title properties in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a shared name . if you want to add or delete a collection from the tool@@ bar or want to delete a collection , you can make it in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view and sort by date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , new ester : these put the date on the date of the oldest , the newest picture or the section of the album . this is first attempted to calculate the average of pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first come up an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open the first picture in the album as symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ er ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as the album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a album list , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be worn .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My keywords list links below in the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window displays the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will appear in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you must wait for short while the preview images are generated . this can prevent you from creating all preview images in the Tools menu .
information on each picture is shown below the corresponding preview . what information is this , you can set up digi@@ kam ; set up . select the albums and adjust the area preview images to your wishes .
the preview images have help window , the appearing . if you leave the mouse cur@@ sor a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top in the introduction into the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all in which it came to &amp; digi@@ kam ; goes . albums and keywords will allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image gallery shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide or the editing of the images .
you can open the image with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select a tutorial on how to edit your photos . using the jQuery Slider window , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu .
you should note that after editing by other image processing programs can come to problems with the met@@ adata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IPTC data , such as orientation , ap@@ ert@@ ure etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the simpl@@ est way is to click on the preview and select the rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved into the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; post@@ pon@@ ed . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ eting or Ent@@ f If you prefer to er@@ ase you , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data window so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the picture may be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been selected with this keyword will appear .
you can also log in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords , too . you can also create parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the par@@ ser implement@@ ations we used for this check are based on Open@@ SP ( SG@@ ML / XML ) and lib@@ xml@@ 2 ( XML ) .
you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch password ; or on an existing keyword , and then select new keyword here . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword after you cli@@ cked on an existing item , this is the sub @-@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a stit@@ ch by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and lay down there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree .
you can change the properties of a stit@@ ch by clicking on the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ches ; change .
to select a different photo as the album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the context menu as a album list . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you have chosen with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ches ; alternatively , you can click on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword from the context menu .
you can create a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you have one of the keywords you assigned to it . on this way you can get a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the Tags menu . the menu shows you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent variable hist@@ ogra@@ m of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shi@@ fted over this hist@@ ogra@@ m . in order to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . this will show all related images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
Neb@@ endar@@ er Such@@ box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search is found . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search is not found , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the left side panel with the bin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars . if you can open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filter what you entered as search crit@@ erion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be executed . the results will be used in the view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View menu and select an option in the context menu .
if you select a search , the form to enter the search box appears in the search box . if you select as advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you can find more information in the section The tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select searches in the context menu .
the Advanced Search offers you an advanced search form with many search options available with which you can search in certain fields by &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of the search rules is used to set the options for search query in the album database . all rules are refer@@ enced by operators separately . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group . any option can be linked with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they are . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a section where you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ eting the results can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of un@@ th@@ ink@@ able search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the suitable images .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L to the Ligh@@ table from the context menu . if you are back in the &amp; digi@@ kam window , you can quickly open the ligh@@ table with L Extras Ligh@@ ter .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible . if you want to synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform a zoo or shooting operations on one of the images , you can also compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly get out of a picture series . if you navigate pairs from the tool@@ bar , the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button at any preview image to display it in the left .
of course , the normal release agents work directly from the lumin@@ ous as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side of the main window are available for both preview images in the lumin@@ ous table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing feature that you can see on the crossed paths . in order to hide the visible area of the image , you need to press this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; both images will display the same image area .
the zoom control works just like in other views . simply use the zoom control under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out in the image . this is done in both images if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital continu@@ ator ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up until the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos capture , scans or digital photos will result in a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your images , find , protect and use photos again . we look at the method for digital photograph@@ ers the &amp; digi@@ kam ; we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , convert , group@@ ing , backup , evaluate , classi@@ fy , classi@@ fy , classi@@ fy , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , edit , and import image files .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
meta data are defined as data on data . met@@ adata can be stored in accordance with your definition data , information on or documentation of other data that are administ@@ ered by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find a certain photo without inventory management longer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save met@@ adata in a database as well as image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving solution that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before making any changes to your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to change it to a larger drive .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly about your location unless you were in a year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archive and 5 % work files and you will then not want to re @-@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to be saved in the site of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IPTC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what is happening ? to do this , &amp; digi@@ kam ; they have a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign any photo keywords , restrictions and an assessment . of course you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and then set the value .
let us now with keywords , keywords as you are frequently called in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalog@@ zed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or put the pictures to the right place . the change of hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub@@ strate to another .
the graphics shows how different met@@ adata can over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data have properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to in@@ scriptions or comments , the third important tool to catalogue your met@@ adata .
you don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , the square .
and now I tell you this one of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historic time period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others that view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning of the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it is the strength only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can place a lot of text , in an internation@@ alized alph@@ abet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as in@@ scription . you can even exp@@ ose it for a selection of images at the same time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light velocity .
the possibilities to use Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already in@@ numer@@ able and will be more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips with ge@@ ographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can also export k@@ ml files using Google Maps . you can also export k@@ ml files using Google Maps .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and marks the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ on@@ ym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , for example to protect the name of the photographer , for example to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .

it is very important to fill in the author and copyright @-@ sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with computer can delete or change the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for individuals and professionals .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper portra@@ its or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be careful and you can no longer trust you than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ved quality , which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about Gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for himself .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording equipment and make them in the right way . the best DVD recording equipment are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you are just first written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control sum@@ s . in spite of this massive protective , they are protected by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently causes mira@@ cles to CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged dis@@ ks , hard dis@@ ks , flash@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to be winning the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ proprietary format . also , you should store the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then on a clean , dark dry and on animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disc@@ rep@@ ancies retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ ability study
shortly : dis@@ ks are the longest when you run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temperature con@@ tours , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , SMAR@@ T cannot find this error .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can usually recover without major problems .
while most electric devices are not far up , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes are different . this can cause heavy damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es may cause locked keys , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , hardware alter@@ ation , damaged mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy mattress and removes the rest . it is normally available in the form of a connector bar .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peri@@ pher@@ als that are connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers put over voltage cont@@ actors , which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically make battery energy available when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to continue working until the current runs . if you buy a U@@ PS , you should be sure that they are able to purchase the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the battery life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
this is only a small price difference if you think how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you start your holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
you are compared to the hard dis@@ ks at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . moreover , you have to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution Online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should only be veri@@ fied in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and distributed storage . thus , they are des@@ aster .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make sure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive is safe .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these dis@@ rup@@ tions remain un@@ covered until you have been destroyed in your computer . it is quite distur@@ bing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ efer@@ ences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ ing systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission issues , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you &apos;ll see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle panel defects on low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one for the G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .

open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the widespread file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during operation is higher and a un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 ap@@ ert@@ ure settings of fundamental physical boundaries . this is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics , the sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , do not worry others for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by any data loss . therefore , make sure your data is much more dangerous than the new installation of your operating system , replacing plates or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you do every day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hits you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget Air@@ craft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually involve a whole room or entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential security : a backup of files have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two tim@@ est@@ ates : the complete backup and the last differential security .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next one with the exception that it is only des@@ erted and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . every further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete check .

so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
since the future is un@@ predi@@ ctable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate as time . unfortunately there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards compatible . the fewer you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explaining the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability , and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store them to a new record :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; lt ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it anymore .
PNG was able to replace GIF as an open source standard , but it can store much more . it is less los@@ sl@@ ess , supports XMP , ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency .
TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . it is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open raw image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ adata . it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ adata .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML @-@ based XMP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves .
many photograph@@ ers prefer to archive it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . it can be saved separately from the image file . however , it can be problems when linking between the met@@ adata file and the image file , and as indicated above , the raw format is split . therefore , you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , which supports a wide range of applications and business models . in the activities of D@@ C@@ MI , the work on an architecture and modelling , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broader acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , card reader or scanner . so long the images on the camera name are used , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your blank menu . this feature is not implemented yet .
for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you restore the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the met@@ adata again .
use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the section adding a photo to a album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , connect it with the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and switch it . a further description will be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . in some cameras it may take a while . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to view camera information at any entry . with the side panels properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single application or its met@@ adata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page strip from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image slider . note that these met@@ adata can not be available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button and then select all the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the chosen selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button download and then select the selected . the button Selected is long as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have been selected until now not by &amp; digi@@ kam , downloaded . in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , you will only download the new pictures .
if you are using the buttons all download or selected selected , a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos will be sorted . the list of existing albums will be sorted in which the photos will be sorted . select the target album from the list and click OK .
after you have selected the target album , click OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photographs , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Delete Clear All Delete . if you want to delete a few , you must first select them first and use Delete Selected Delete .
note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album downloaded before you want to delete them from the camera .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ utili@@ zed after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can cause dup@@ licate file names if you upload photos of different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful , the date and time when the image has been made to the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ categories . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during the transfer opens three other options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the IPTC files . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to format a different file format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix f@@ oto@@ - % d % H : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M . turn on the Add date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option of camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file name in small case letters . or in upper@@ case case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera is available in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when opening the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page tool@@ bar Met@@ ad@@ aten you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally enabled , and if your camera doesn &apos;t provide this information , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera is using information about the date on which the photo has been made available , it can be downloaded and digi@@ kam ; these sub @-@ albums are loaded in the same sub@@ album . all images with the same date will be uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in section page tool@@ bar meta data you can read what information you have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the button extension and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ ben option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button downloading . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the picture selection is completed , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , where the pictures are to be loaded . select the desired folder and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position meant to be displayed in length and width gra@@ phs and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to car@@ to@@ graph an area by automatically recording the GPS data . environmental planning , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo has been done , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , users will want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . the question is actually more , how the data can come into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the ki@@ pi module for ge@@ ographic mapping ( manual ) and last over the manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .

downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save this data in g@@ px format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module .

with the setting of los@@ sl@@ ess JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ sl@@ ess free . even if you select the los@@ sl@@ ess setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the editing image was just a picture viewer for photos . at present , it is very fast to manipul@@ ate your photos to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image slider .
the standard calibration is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details .
if this option is set , the white balance is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors , the use of the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ supplied images in four steps will get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ light , so the parts of your pictures are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top lich@@ ter in the settings . the setting colors will produce some unusual results because it shows the top lights in various ro@@ ses . last@@ ly , you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red por@@ tions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to re@@ construct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three com@@ promises and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the default 1 . this can also be done in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; - jQuery Slider window .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ q algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data generated by the color @-@ filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and that is a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Colour reconstruction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests , it looks like as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w , but it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable results .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , as you will be carried out during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like colour information from a colour space can be translated into the others so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
if a picture is opened in the image gallery / color management module with raw files .
color profile folder set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam , this folder will then be checked during boot .
settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative compared to x@@ cali@@ b or ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures of color not the whole screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain color tone mapping or gam@@ ma correction . currently d@@ cra@@ w Gam@@ ma corrected not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color tone .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print picture , since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what it is intended for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together .
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
ki@@ pi is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it &apos;s an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing are supported . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules are supported to work together with each program supporting the ki@@ pi interface .
if your distribution has installed the ki@@ pi modules , see a list of available modules . select those that you want to use , and these will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings . short commands can be set .
more information ( in English ) about ki@@ pi modules can be obtained via the ki@@ pi project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ gin@@ s.@@ org or in the manuals of ki@@ pi modules .
the Di@@ asch@@ au settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other tick boxes turn off the met@@ adata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera features are shown on the left side a list of all available cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire storage camera from the camera branch . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / guest , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer to turn and switch them into display mode .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can manually set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera you can insert all here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving from &gt; images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can adjust the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes by the right side bar can be closed silent by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to use changes in the right side bar without any feedback . otherwise , you need to save changes with the button changes .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; when starting , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting at the start of the new photos forced &amp; digi@@ kam ; the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this prolon@@ gs the start time by &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it is to delete it from the base folder .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam , to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to fix and improve . the image can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the presentation / Edit .
the image gallery contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so they are not part of your distribution .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top of the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the editing image will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saving or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should therefore possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file saving .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File menu , or use the button The Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore content in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change you have done at the photo since the last save .
almost every action of the editing image can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Re@@ verse or Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should note the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
when you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you will find a moment longer through the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also revers@@ ed and restored .
once you have started the image slider , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can view and zoom in the photo in which you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ sich@@ ts menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the settings dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting the jQuery Slider window .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print the picture in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print some images or entire sentences . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the Album Export Wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without navigation keys , even in the jquery slider .
select the language in which this site should be shown
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . this means that all special characters are allowed . the lettering are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C- fields so that you can use other programs .
IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IPTC @-@ label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after watching it , use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the lettering will then be saved .
besides the An@@ gle button there is a button More . with this , you can read other met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata in the files . this will always be performed if you have chosen a met@@ adata setting that is always written into the images .
this section review shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the page bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation will be written in the IPTC @-@ field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords before in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; session ended stit@@ ch words .
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search keyword . you can thus restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have given different keywords , these are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate tick boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved in the IPTC @-@ field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection if you want to add a selection of a keyword , please read the section keyword filter .
the page header keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views are used . if additionally one or more keywords can be used from the right @-@ hand side , only the inter@@ section of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and place them . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword exists , you can simply drag them out of the right side panel and place them on the selection .
in the upper case , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is restricted to no keywords , which reduces the amount of three images . they were drawn with C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right click tree has been moved to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched between different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it would be one or not , you can easily change it with double @-@ click on the text and in the rule range .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced Search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . you can see the options as follows :
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ designed workflow is that the colors shown by your camera or scanner are a predi@@ ctable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colour @-@ designed workflow you can achieve that the colors appear on your monitor similar to your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish to them from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme is on colour management , everyone wants to know what buttons need to press for the results which he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make informed choices so that you will receive the desired result .
if your workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about colour management .
they work on a monitor which is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut . ( see below )
your only other image editions are via email or web where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you then use a different colour gam@@ ut and have to worry about colour management ?
a visual sample of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fei@@ sen@@ ic region , and colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sion@@ ale representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms exc@@ ell@@ ente site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ li@@ fy my monitor when I decided to work in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! if you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you &apos;ll have to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor , since s@@ RGB is out that your monitor is colored on s@@ RGB cal@@ li@@ graphy , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard cal@@ li@@ graphy , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
norm@@ alize the functions , equ@@ als , automatic balance and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic correction try to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ osity levels above the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its colour sh@@ ading .
balance : this method adjust@@ s the light intensity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the same very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonder at a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m range .
contrast : this method improves contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in between in between . this is only visible in pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is something limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do far from the original image , areas with exposure exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the shell mode , which works in 16 bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copy@@ righ@@ ted by P@@ aw@@ el T. Joch@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and preview of the target image will be adjusted . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
right above , a hist@@ ogra@@ m displays that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixel very small lumin@@ ous values . with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment allows you to improve your photos or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ t with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator increases the colours if more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is displayed .. you will see the combined result in the white balance . this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance which you have set can be saved in a text file and re@@ load later .
the button Pre@@ ferences sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings can be displayed as your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires even more disk space , computing time and stands only for formats of PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assign@@ ing color profiles . color tone control can be done through the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use it for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner needs the same mistakes and you always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects will provide you with four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a vel@@ via filter , a neon effect and a cant@@ een filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar ar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then complet@@ es the development of the image . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase will ultimately create a negative image that is not to be generated on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that process ( 2 ) . the intensity of applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , he em@@ bodies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts .
the Ne@@ on@@ Filter simul@@ ates neon light to the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the thickness of the neon light . in large pictures the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to modify the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can look at the different colour aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase them . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool ton@@ al correction is based on the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you need to specify the area of the slide . more details the three slider below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three sliders are cli@@ cked in and that can be shi@@ fted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright sections .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and make sure that the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be set to determine whether the hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . in this case the logical classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three colour p@@ etting can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the shadows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used for example , to create a hidden image as background while something else in the for@@ eg@@ round .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically placed in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values stored in the file system can be saved and re@@ loaded later . the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the history of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous channels .
the Sur@@ veillance Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images with a digital camera , the linear mode of a constant color generates a wide beam . in this case , the logical mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are cor@@ ner@@ ed with dar@@ ker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos you can see a red marking . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Option Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black white picture that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; jQuery is a tool to improve color channels or modify the color sh@@ ading of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the Color Channel Mixer .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first hint of how you can correct the channels by watching the relative distribution and impact . the left section of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m appears to indicate the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction enable you to mix these channels . if you are able to activate L@@ umin@@ ance the image will keep the overall brightness even if you use the option Mon@@ och@@ rome , as the channel bl@@ ender then is the creation of great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portra@@ its .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color to a visible noise is caused by the color channel . colour bre@@ ads consist of small noise arti@@ facts that are not at the same place in the colour channel and whose noise patterns are different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the color first .
the saving and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any Mixer setting can save you later and then load them . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel bl@@ ender format .
the Sur@@ veillance Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . in the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film lighting with a red line filter . this creates dramatic sky @-@ effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of time . so similar to the 003 co@@ kin ( tm ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film lighting with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 co@@ kin ( tm ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit cold into the shadow tones . this is very similar to the process of preparing a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 co@@ kin ( tm ) sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper texture is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam , tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
to keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is no easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your picture . throughout the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , rounded around it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture in any place . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from colour space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will need to be the character set size of the image size .
every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam device template you can place a template on a picture .
the picture template can be used in the image gallery can be used to place templates on a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation . however , you have to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you must set your st@@ encil folder with the button base folder in the dialog box . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder is set for templates , a tree view , which reflects the folder structure of the st@@ encil folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview tool@@ bar of the templates .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is c@@ entered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button sh@@ red@@ ders the below picture . it is c@@ entered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must rotate the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template below . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy to produce , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
Un@@ ity mask works on the contrast of edges around a picture shar@@ pen@@ ing . in fact , it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
ref@@ ok@@ s@@ having is possibly the best of the three as it really improves shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adap@@ ting .
the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners are turning a focus screen already during reading the image . if you disable this , you get the control over your image .
in some situations , you can obtain usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . this allows you to focus shar@@ pen@@ ing with the menu entry .
however , you should be careful not to handle the results very naturally : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases shar@@ p@@ ness of edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image will ref@@ ill the tool . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to make the picture a bit soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for the soft@@ ener with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ eners and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ade is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in radi@@ us or the amount increases the effect .
the radio shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radius . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images at the best in their final resolution .
the amount determines the percentage between the original and the wis@@ ely picture one which is added to the original . thus , the thickness of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ ell@@ value is a break out of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for a channel of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ating and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ cul@@ ine was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; ref@@ oc@@ us@@ ate tool ref@@ uses an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted un@@ folding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a shar@@ p@@ ness mask .
in practice , the circular circuit works much better than the pal@@ ate &apos;s folding . the pal@@ ate &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical outcome even from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced by most cases even very strongly from the removed pixels . this causes und@@ esi@@ rable results .
circular edge shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular circuit . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most of the images the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very sharp should then pay attention .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate . use this parameter if your Un@@ ity Gau@@ ß is . this is most often caused by a previously executed Un@@ ity Filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value non@@ zero otherwise you must also increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ den noise filter .
matrix codes : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you select big values for the circular edge or the pal@@ ate . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any ref@@ uted parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later leave un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , un@@ sharp mask produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mask of a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mask has to create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be removed the effect of the shar@@ p@@ ness . the result of the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least just as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ clear color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for field correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the controller Smo@@ oth sets the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to not remove the arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various default settings as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings .
detail view p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image .
direction Depend@@ ability Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is smooth in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this is the maximum smoothing factor above all . p then defines relative smoothing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is common because it is then difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ step distance da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More on quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . therefore we recommend it to let it out .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . each setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ dest@@ al ; effects of in@@ scri@@ bed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ directory details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the pixel spac@@ ing . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine fluor@@ escent changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controlled the edge accuracy for shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the whole noise can be removed or sp@@ ik@@ es can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details Settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details Settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ ma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically tend to be rough@@ ened .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase cycle absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove smo@@ kes and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to shar@@ pen the picture is a bit soft , fortunately a lot easier than a picture . use this tool for the soft@@ ener with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ eners and experiment with the deposit . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adjusted to remove any noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local faul@@ ts that occur in digital , original or retro@@ sp@@ ectively digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss of compression algorithm it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ ther ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) 700@@ si camera onto a Il@@ ford ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the Scan art@@ ef@@ acts that have been created with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove the hot pixels of photos with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem with high @-@ quality raw mode photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to capture the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the correc@@ ting image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard is automatically re@@ viewing the final dark image and re@@ loads this automatically in the next session .
the image range and preview help you to correct the results within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ dic@@ tive areas .
select an area to view the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filter available :
Dur@@ cut : it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 by pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in the block .
k@@ ub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is a tool for correc@@ ting the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ lined corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially in medium and large photo formats , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ obj@@ tive shows also this behavior .
many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the ap@@ ert@@ ure filter , which increases the necessary closure time under circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise imp@@ aired effects can occur through movement .
with the wide exposure ranges from present @-@ day film and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter by using an equivalent transformation in a raw image that has been made without this filter . the tool Vign@@ ette correction is the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ Filter . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting accuracy filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates with an optical filter with an ap@@ ert@@ ure setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , correspon@@ d@@ ingly lower the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ ation , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
brightness , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers present only positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want to adjust the brightness of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can drag the images from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture . a lamp and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stor@@ tions . colour di@@ stor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ ft deals with the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ vex form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ ft has a similar circuit effect , fla@@ x but on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ der correc@@ ts the remote corners opposite to the second gra@@ der . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geomet@@ ric distortion .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion of second gra@@ ft . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped di@@ stor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of fourth dig@@ its . this value is stronger to the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the revers@@ ed character of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive the image .
bright : this value adjust@@ s brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustr@@ ates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as default values .
the ton@@ ne or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or size changes . in case you have to cut a picture and then perform a tone @-@ shaped correction , the effect is apparent in the groove .
to help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place .
if you correct a cushion @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can cut them with the cutting tool in the menu trans@@ forms from the image slider or the zoom controller of this dialog .
for most of the pictures the tone @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves like shots from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct the angle in the image of 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film by the G@@ imp@@ ho@@ o.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the optional Fü@@ ge Film@@ strip if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter is mixed to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filtering sensor applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed fil@@ ming like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ dak Tri @-@ X .
the film gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ c@@ eful sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you need to use this filter .
the regulator can cali@@ br@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is although often higher values are needed , ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suitable for large pictures .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel sized image is 1 and smoothing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a char@@ coal sketch . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 in order to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( embos@@ sing ) .
this is an example of the carbon draw filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Gra@@ v@@ ur conc@@ eals your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Gra@@ v@@ ur is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure that is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work piece by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Un@@ ity effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : bl@@ urred the image along three @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one focal point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sport photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ ity : bl@@ urred the image by rotation of the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removing un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urred the image by horizontal motions of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shining soft focal effect ( Hamilton Effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow .
protect the image by acci@@ dental displac@@ ement of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a random moving camera .
smart Un@@ ity : find the colour pool in the picture and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ mp drops are a nice small tool to make rain@@ drops onto your image . it gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ heb@@ er@@ legally protected algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small pictures . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can drag a area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start to start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain drop filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it to the right orientation by mir@@ r@@ oring or rotating .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
a picture of smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image when the boundaries of resolution are reached ? how can you restore the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
keep the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the input of the new size will remain the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is set , since it is then difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and Download are used exactly . every single photo can be saved as text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small coloured image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
the editing of a photo is not only a commonly performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo , you just have to use the mouse only the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The tri@@ mming button of the image slider in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file save or save file from the File menu to save the newly created photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains int@@ act .
in the tool After the aspect ratio , you can provide orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the higher value of the height and the width of the width is assigned .
the tool After the aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically switch horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in the dialog you can set up the range for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After the aspect ratio calcul@@ ates its settings dependent on the orientation ( horizontal or ver@@ tically ) . if you are using the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the image and not the original image .
the settings of the composition help make it possible to help you create your images better . these aids are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic elements are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ bass , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide the rect@@ angle into similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles to the diag@@ onal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the Ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 3@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was already used by the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ eks that constructed your tem@@ ples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers .
the golden centre provides liquid auxiliary lines when you assemble a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ hand gel , the golden spiral generates a liquid line which the eye can follow through the image . this type of composition leads to the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects .
the gold tri@@ angles are also derived from the top discussed golden spiral . the points of the gold rect@@ angles are the middle points of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , gold tri@@ angles are not a angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal of these lines can be a static object dynamic .
when you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect of professional photograph@@ ers dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try to place your picture focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mir@@ r@@ oring can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color , you can set the color of the hel@@ per lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way , you can customize the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things around an angle are rot@@ ated . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; or repair the tool free rotation .
turn your picture with the slide . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
for your help , the Free rotation module provides horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines . after having moved it over an important point of the image , you can adjust it to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find und@@ esi@@ rable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is the function transform@@ ieren s@@ lic@@ ing from the image slider .
an elegant way to cut the image is the feature Automatic assignment . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option controls the image a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed region .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed region .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed region .
after adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a little dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adap@@ tations create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean this is the picture with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image slider .
the tool is used to move part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m .
sc@@ is@@ sors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can switch horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically . if you press on default settings , the angle will appear to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , vertical and horizontal line finishes . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button around the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ oring , the image will wi@@ pe a bit . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ats generate twice as much wi@@ rel@@ ing and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shooting , the picture has un@@ ador@@ ned tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the picture with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image slider .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to process a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ kam ;
because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats in this place , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done by the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can view this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . in this way , redund@@ ant information will be reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000@@ er version can also store los@@ sl@@ ess if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour . you can read raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all support cameras can be seen at the bottom on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , there is no film editing program and is therefore not able to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback from movies to start playback .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can do the first four adjustments with the module white balance .
many tools you need for photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description is here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ener , noise suppression , ref@@ ok@@ s@@ ating , bl@@ urred , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Text@@ ur Applic@@ a ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . on the left side of him , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ licate . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected pre@@ dic@@ tive .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pre@@ dic@@ tive .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower to comparison the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and sub @-@ exposure . the colours used can be adjusted in the general setting side .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the page tool@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and use colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be found either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case you are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders according to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is added under the button color , the color will be inserted at the cur@@ sor . the color will be inserted either or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing has been selected , you can set this mode by selecting the check box over Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ pboard : for any color three values for the portion of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if another color is followed .
the colors in the palette and the output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ y@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph will be used in science , in particular in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize gra@@ phs .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; the project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphite ; -@@ dot ; graph . the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graph with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is re@@ produced and displayed in &amp; k@@ graph ) ;
menu to open graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open graph in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large gra@@ phs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than that knot )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph . needed in detail :
the main window displays the open graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file and open the ( empty ) list last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more and dot items , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can also make your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; see also .
if you want to open a graph@@ file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; - instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph editor ; instance , or want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but you can change it later with the setup dialog .
at the start of the program you can re @-@ open all gra@@ phs of your last session . again , you can change your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that will come on a page will be added to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
side preview with a graph without head line and with a different font
the Renew@@ t shop page gives the ability to set the behavior if a file has been changed on the disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore changes ) or the program every time .
the page opens the way to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; specify if a Graph is open outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is required .
the Site Maintenance Administration gives the option to set the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not ) or determine if you want to be asked with each start .
the context menu , which normally appears in a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries found on the website of &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm puts the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce short edges and as few edge over@@ l@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ suspension model . in this way , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai algorithm is used , which is syn@@ on@@ ymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm produces a spr@@ ing@@ spring model -@@ layout . it uses the Fru@@ eh@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi@@ layer timer for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm ass@@ esses the node of circle in accordance with the description of Six and tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kauff@@ man and Wi@@ ese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ clic@@ al structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ file as parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms provide special options , or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) , and uses the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed gra@@ phs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the what is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further assistance to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the base folder of the source archive .

the ki@@ pi module images can be retri@@ eved using tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scanning : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you scan the menu entry , a dialog box displays between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by using the default duc@@ tile settings to select your picture accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka Handbook you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed because some settings may not be displayed .
once you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window will appear to set the target image . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you will also need to select the folder and # 160 by saving the image .
you can create screen photos after you have selected in the menu Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ - &gt; screen shot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you can read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete working area , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen photo will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to go there .
after the screen shot was made , the dialog box of the target image appears with the options described above .

the ki@@ pi module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit the meta data in the met@@ adata of an image and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the ki@@ pi module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert data to you from your GPS device .
figure Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with G@@ PX file . this file contains data that have been recorded at the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera can be changed by GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera eit . if the devi@@ ation below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this field .
the options Inter@@ poli@@ shing and Differ@@ ence in minutes can be used if you have no appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a loc@@ ating in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ation .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog gets the coordinates of a call to the next note , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location may also be found and set by the displayed map . select the respective region and increase si@@ e.@@ Add this again through until you have reached a reaching accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the ki@@ pi module there are ways to mount the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the Ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the ki@@ pi module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums to be exp@@ orted as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
this module has four tabs that can be adapted to the settings . the tab allows it to select all albums to be exp@@ orted to HTML . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right side , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly see a large number of albums . in the area below you will see the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the tab of the tab defines the overall appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will appear in the image . otherwise the image will appear directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed .
the Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . it naturally also affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press down to break the process .
when the module is created , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occur during the creation . the web browser will automatically start to view the preview of the gallery . press the module to close the module .
the ki@@ pi picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL supported tool to view images .
the ki@@ pi picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom , or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the ki@@ pi JPEG Los@@ sl@@ ess Module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to store images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of los@@ sl@@ ess storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the color information is taking place .
the ki@@ pi module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the ki@@ pi module digital camera client does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the Mail@@ ing@@ liste des ki@@ pi teams at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the ki@@ pi module Met@@ adata editor has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org des ki@@ pi @-@ teams .
the import function of the met@@ adata module allows you to copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then select the import function .
this feature does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any destination format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ 2 to see what formats are supported .
the ki@@ pi MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the Di@@ asch@@ au . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . for burning the medium you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that indicate an image . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can start drinking a coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au when you are back .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button Settings .
the printer enables you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : make sense to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this ki@@ pi module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a origin@@ ality of Him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w .
first , select the RAW file that should be converted and run the module . the Raw @-@ Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Preview preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not have any effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sl@@ ess algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all information of your image and uses los@@ sl@@ ess L@@ Z@@ W compression .
TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ adata that are contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion with the output button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use them .
the stack processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single pictures . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to modify the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or increase the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your picture to the screen format .
not propor@@ tion@@ ate : not proportional size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo box . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this ki@@ pi module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before .
after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you selected . you can add more images via the button to add images . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right side .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list and drag them to the list of the images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent from the list of images .
after you have selected all images , you can open the New Message window of your E @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are already attached as attachment .
don &apos;t forget to send many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and each time you use it again .
select your email clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ Mail Agent on your computer before downloading . you can download this here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , comments will be added to the pictures in a text file and put the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best suited for los@@ sl@@ ess formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to send@@ mail .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages , looking for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . by closing this window you can close this window ?
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window will appear with questions as you want to see your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the option file names indicate that the fil@@ ename of the pictures will appear in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a final loop . you can then manually with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the pictures will be displayed in a random order . so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album .
between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitions effects between you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect between the images .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch off .
with this tool@@ bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the di@@ asch@@ au .
on the left lower screen edge you can see the current fil@@ ename , the location of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the ki@@ pi module time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the Mail@@ ing@@ liste des ki@@ pi teams at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the ki@@ pi module background image is a tool for setting an image as background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface area .
once you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , you are now in any group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries are available .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have given information when you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view photos in order to view the images of your scope .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but for every person you can save your own preview image , which also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see the picture .
in order to display images next to the name , select the button , which is on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display a list of keywords with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you have to specify the image for each individual person . to do this , you need to view the picture @-@ An@@ sich@@ ts window ( described in detail ) and select the category editor . in the An@@ sich@@ ts window you can customize the picture for the appropriate person . in the An@@ sich@@ ts window you can customize the picture for the appropriate person . in the An@@ sich@@ ts window you can customize the picture for the appropriate person .
if you visit the window in the main window , you will see a dialog that is similar to the dialog for setting the image properties very similar . this dialog allows you to view the image once again .
if you want to enter a string in the field description or description , the descriptions and descriptions of the pictures are searched after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here you will find pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather try to try out the following options , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the fast @-@ entry , the screen pictures and entry videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name says , this bar shows you date of date about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar indicates another unit . you can switch between units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar allows you to interact with the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you will see the first image of this date in preview ) and in addition , the time bar always shows the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button and the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and destination .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file will be created on the overview page . if you want to see the export files you &apos;ll find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages , so you can avoid that information will be displayed without description . for example , that all images are taken from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; at the moment all images are exp@@ orted . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus those who support your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no pictures for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have specified . so you can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if he would like to get an image bigger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
at best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent sentence .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible for viewers . if you have created a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages were created , you should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them manually . so the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the currently described settings are related to all three basic folders and URLs . in this way , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you set in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . if you have already spent a lot of time for the images , recording place , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ from the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and this file can be passed on as independent . the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for exp@@ orting pictures you can view from the File External Menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
in the option to copy Manu@@ ell to the .@@ k@@ im file you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most of the pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth@@ while to comp@@ ress the files . if you would like this , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size limit . if you send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture is at most 800 pixel high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import File menu , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import@@ ing the exp@@ orted database as described in .
the wizard to import is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the import@@ ing file ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called for your database . therefore , you &apos;ll be asked in the third dialog box , which categories of the imported file will be imported and which categories are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can adjust the categories of the import@@ ing file with the categories of your present database . for example , you can see on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view photos : if you look at pictures , you might often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on this , you might want to see all the pictures that this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) to specify the information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it was expanded and today it is also taking care of your videos . at many places in this manual it will be talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all his information in the index.@@ xml file in the upper@@ most folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male Backup Tools , copy on a disk or re@@ visions in the C@@ VS .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
in the following section of the User Manual , the different settings will be explained in the following section of the User Manual .
on the left you will see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it has been described as you can specify different properties for each image , for example , persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for any existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete list of member groups , i.e. all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ bar and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called ki@@ pi and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called through the Module . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules yourself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules over ki@@ pi are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use ki@@ pi is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you want to use the category people , then &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , so if you would have chosen people to view the module and pass this to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select the module which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own images .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the above menu and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you have not added any information about your images . in this section we will see the window that will show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can place each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section , if you want to see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the moving of the pictures within the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 images , the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be depicted , so that the names are moved up@@ wards to find people faster and assigned .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the icon for sorting after date below the list .
if you have any comments for each image individually , you might want to edit all the images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . just click on the front and back buttons , which are below the preview of the image .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment .

on the picture you will see a browser window which shows the USA as a sur@@ round . to show you that it is a group , a special icon will appear .
in the context menu of the ann@@ otation dialog is possible to add an entry to an existing or new overlay or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also draw one entry into one category and place it in order to make it a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ otation dialog by clicking on and move the cor@@ ds that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and look of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and click on the window below . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all images you have no filter set . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of preview images , by simple down@@ ward pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image viewer will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press the Remove button or select Edit Select from the Edit menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use the images somewhere , so you can record the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is for example with the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you can view the preview of these pictures .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and back into it again . if you want to avoid anno@@ ying your images , please download a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , you filter the images so that at the end of those who want to see others in@@ accessible and click on the latest view . alternatively , you can also use all the images that your little sister can see , fire and lock the menu entry all except current view .
this allows you to set the pictures in the case of the case . if you give your laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry , so that all the pictures you want to have blocked . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the menu of privacy .
please remember that this image protection is not very secure . you can find all the images on the hard disk and another one can read or delete the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to am@@ end the view of private pictures .
the reason why you all manage your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; of course , you can spend hours of hours with them , of course , that you want to look at it some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start it from the preview as described in detail .
the viewer can see you in . he naturally shows the picture , but additional information you have about the image , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag them with the mouse and locate somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see , suitable entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can change between them and go back by using the buttons picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slide . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or Min@@ us .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it &apos;s possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
with the Min@@ us button , you can easily zoom out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out the plus button in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and displays the result of the zoom .
with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the par@@ ity key , the zoom uses the zoom , so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out @-@ out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can add comments to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you view images , it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . in the moment you can open the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures , and mark them as well or poor@@ ly , while you look one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can use a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set the features on your images , these are available in the browser . so you can see all the pictures you have to edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can simply use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to view Categories in In@@ dre View view , you can press features to the images by simply pressing the letters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can undo your painting later .
in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply click the cross on the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work to work , you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views are shown .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ properties are already selected by the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you enter invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview a preview of the property view .
press Preview in the Own View and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture , even if you want to ren@@ ame a subordin@@ ate element . if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross the local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window .
you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is less or equal to the visible level of view of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it at any time . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the an@@ f@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the an@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to assign multiple views on one another , drag the an@@ f@@ asser into the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map sheet at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to release a view from anch@@ oring , drag the an@@ f@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow at the top of the arrow in the panel bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the panel bar . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with view of Window order . it will appear a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dern it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click the Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view .
a R@@ ender mode comp@@ lies with entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ ew a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add as many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon The render settings in the tool@@ bar or in the View of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select the following dialog :
any R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ame only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields .
in combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual and P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , images with this property look better .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive , because each pixel is continuously split up and adap@@ tively because each pixel is continuously split and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sive depth of the calculated colour values depends on .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between color values to the neighbor@@ ing pixels is dealt with the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels using super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exce@@ eds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be monitored individually and checked for further submission . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch to J@@ it@@ tering , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern .
the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full command sum@@ p of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter data ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not located in the folder of the scene , you will also need to enter the path to these files . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type label .
you can set the object @-@ start of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail level for two directions .
if you cross the High level of detail for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera is using an extended projection . expanded proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature creates a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours .
if you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours .
when ti@@ ghtening edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions , you will be explained how to create and store window directions .
the Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the button add and remove a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window ordering . new views can you create with the button Add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with map card , you will get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to begin without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene under beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain that you will only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering will be used as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t want to insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything in error free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry .
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the properties properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera sees control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point and pull it to the desired place .
if you push the button or press the Enter button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might want to insert a qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complete method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a sim@@ pler way . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited final level . if you ren@@ ew the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will only see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the different options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , changing the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose Shift and set the values as follows :
just choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but you can choose something slightly at the moment .
in both cases a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the object . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment shows only a matte black material because you can check the color of materials at any time with a click on preview . now give the color for the pig@@ ment .
if you see no color on qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now properly adjusted . if you ren@@ ew your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you need to specify two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called one colored . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can be used only with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose any single colour in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you already be able to do so , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball is just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input button or button to press ) so that the ball is sw@@ inging above the floor , because you have shi@@ fted the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering is now a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . use a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to you now . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as colour :
choose First Objects and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click the Pig@@ ment Ball , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the next screen pictures and click on or press Enter .
the brightness effect and reflection are already partially good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces , even if Met@@ alli@@ sch : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you find a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing , the rendering of the hypothe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which ren@@ ders the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the vector calcul@@ ates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source , you see nothing , the image is just black . obviously every scene you want to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files typically have the file extensions * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already have saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used the reverse .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ writing an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , button short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change the short command for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify commands or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set the tool bar . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to forward rough surfaces without modi@@ fying any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic structures are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is an option to indicate the surface of an object color to pixel base , by applying a image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full@@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return button .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are always to use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the operation mode of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short@@ cut for the display window and short@@ cut for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window .

the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common features that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists
Amar@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback when the script can &apos;t be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script if all the modules are available and use a dialog so that the user is not running .
the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your web site uses another port , you will have to enter it here .
in the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p , which should lie to each K@@ DE installation .
most scripts allow the execution of external programs and commands . usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; ber@@ ok ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , each script itself needs to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script might now refer to &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; finish , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; ber@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s script administration can also install script packages installed by a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; ber@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script pack@@ ets correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the loaded modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :

&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen pictures .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile k@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD prec@@ edes that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will bring a bug in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can find the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the cap@@ tive file that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most often it is that Tag@@ lib for reading the meta information from this file crash . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is something more mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler . if e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to crash when editing the Meta information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ sd , turn off autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace email ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open when crash ) . if it is a common crash , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in meta information , but they do not identify as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .

to fix this error , you may need to remove any Colum@@ bian Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some options . most install@@ ation@@ problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for other users or developers . use the forum and IRC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .

after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list will appear .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under Tools statistics .
the significance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , in the play@@ list the evaluation column must be displayed in the play@@ list . click anywhere in the new assessment column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Delete on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select from play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them drop it exactly how you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the addition button , the button can be saved . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; ber@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .

no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is which media types support G@@ asp@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every just imagin@@ able audio format . g@@ stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! perhaps you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 de@@ coder ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and achieve simultaneous audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem and help . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. shock sink ) .
that &apos;s &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media will need to be enco@@ ded at first . you can only listen to AL@@ SA but you would only hear a white noise . g@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a de@@ coder with little overhead . g@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . g@@ stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable Sound@@ Server with the highest possible priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this bug report . the enlar@@ ging of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either use not the Arts driver but instead of G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ dat &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er , you need to register all the components . sign up register to register all G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in IRC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then perform all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder using the gst @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and then run again . rest@@ art &amp; ber@@ ok ; .

this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and play@@ list .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display that shows the current current piece or current stream . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red game time to still remaining playing time .

the play@@ list of &amp; amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed play@@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is no other player . but let &apos;s not sh@@ y away from the full@@ ness of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the most excellent functions of play@@ list , such as the context browser . the play@@ list is easy to use and yet even for advanced users .
the context @-@ browser displays various information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser design . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . this three sub@@ windows will later be used in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you may wonder that the sub@@ window will drop off . the information presented there are now in other parts of &amp; amar@@ ok ; moreover , the information can be collected in the statistical window ( extras statistics ) .
the music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window shows information on the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and beside it a Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to hit the piece in the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Music@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
in order to view covers images in the context browser , the cover images are in the same folder as the current piece . the images may have any names , but images with the word front in the name will be preferred . the context browser will show covers images , which are either downloaded by the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , Recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set up what information in the music sub@@ window will be displayed . click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work and you will see the contents of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to play@@ list .
this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages . as soon as you click on the text box , try &amp; ber@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; amar@@ ok ; s collection database .
the button searches opens a search for goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter .
group@@ ing interpre@@ t / album - the pieces will be arranged according to the interpre@@ ter , and there will be another division after the respective album . if you want to see summar@@ ies or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list below .
group@@ ing interpre@@ t / year - album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the standard 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and below according to interpre@@ t .
group@@ ing genre / performer / album - This setting works just as the above , but also sorted by album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can easily customize and combine the group@@ ing .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; amar@@ ok ; will automatically detect your collection once you have something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the supervision . hints for using this filter can be found in the section on the play@@ list in this manual .
the search filter is a selection field , with its help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year . in addition , you can also select your entire collection so that the filter is practically turned off .
by clicking on the right mouse button on an entry in the Collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This le@@ es the current play@@ list and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double click on one entry you reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e queu@@ e . this will be played next to the next .

to transfer media player - joining the pieces to the queu@@ e for transfer@@ ring to the Media Player . more details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser .
burn all pieces of this interpre@@ ter / burn on CD - the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - marking the selected album as a composition , which appears under different artists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is displayed in a normal album . the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ts but also on the respective performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the play@@ list browser designed to handle many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , he also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . they use &amp; amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even self @-@ created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intelligent play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new intelligent play@@ list . there you can enter all the required criteria for your new play@@ list .
the Media Player sub @-@ window is used for connecting &amp; amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this way , the tracks will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is completed , finish &amp; ber@@ ok ; and dis@@ solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you can find a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is a address bar with which you can pick music from a entered URL . if you are for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the play@@ list and drop .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the attachments of files may be difficult . in this case the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will be added automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the play@@ list contains all of you to play attached pieces . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop . above the play@@ list you will only see the pieces that contain the letters . in order to reset the filter , press the button until the text box is empty again .
if you are searching for separate search terms , search &amp; ber@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter a two three search terms , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found which contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ espace , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this is why Mike Old@@ field included , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you provide a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : - something searches for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants to another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or contain a higher rating than 50 and not the comment bad .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key pressed and then clicking the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are re@@ produced .
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of play@@ list . on the left side you will find the Add to add the play@@ list to the left .
next follow the buttons Return and Rest@@ ore . this allows you to undo or recover changes to the play@@ list .

the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information on play@@ list . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces .
you can also hide the status bar . disable the Status bar option in General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list on the menu . above this menu , you can access the settings of &amp; amar@@ ok ;

with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select :
the queu@@ e management received your major adv@@ ent in &amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have more control over the play@@ list . after you have set a piece to the queu@@ e , a number represents a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; ber@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 first played , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece of queu@@ e for a queu@@ e , select the piece in the play@@ list and then click + . you can easily add the pieces to the play@@ list or use the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queu@@ e administration .

opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a photo of a CD , which you can then burn later on . moreover , you can also use the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a photo of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . furthermore there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog will ask you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ tmp or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported yet , you need to use other tools like Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously created DVD image . the dialog will prompt you after a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously selected DVD video can be converted . this dialog box will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used univers@@ ally . it contains information about the em@@ itted video , coding settings and even ways to modify the size and to cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , content will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ lock the media .
the content view enables the selection and pulling of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow range that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar does not have any real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view clearly from the other views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the button assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yp@@ ad assign@@ ments below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup wizard . this allows the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set up general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality range , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the accompanying programs you have .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must ensure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; programs have common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD , and other functions for creating new projects .
void Intel@@ lig@@ ent@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project on the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String name ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Sets ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Filter@@ Iter@@ ator ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Filter@@ Iter@@ ator ( Q@@ String path )
in this way , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ folder bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; reading for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and of many enco@@ ders who code this WAV file ( compression ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ sl@@ ess and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ sl@@ ess FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step you must have l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile something itself .
which code@@ book / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is protected , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ing protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ bled at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is captured manually .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you can find further information about how this program is used as well as screen pictures with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
starts the C@@ DD@@ B query of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet will first be made . )
starts reading and - if a enco@@ der has been configured in the coding settings in the setup window - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of the available enco@@ ders so that the selection with a different enco@@ der can be read than the standard . it is necessary to note that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings in the Setup dialog .
open the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; exit ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with various cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . hi@@ jack must go before the program can successfully be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; Sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; P@@ it &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .

+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rate rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rate rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG reproduction devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR compression rate around 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a Tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate around 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ els . good recovery for music of young people , portable devices and car regi@@ sters . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely have the absolute highest quality without regard to the size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / used / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the code@@ cs explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( english : tag ) if MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button description in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself in the computer . it is to be noted that this is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not supposed to be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ ring@@ ed .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than those in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used by the server ( This can only be the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ogra@@ m should be used to use fre@@ ed@@ b . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually generated monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my host ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see Note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not done yet .
to save the generated WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . during the first open are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the code . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the co@@ ders can be used . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers more information can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the case of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter by step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual read everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can naturally do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permission ( eg ; by using the Kon@@ quer@@ or something inside ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; something that is pres@@ um@@ ably done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each outing &amp; CD .
here we determine the coding of the music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will not change it at any time reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device recording is transferred to the reading program that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device of your disk . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map General settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here you can find an additional conversion . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screens@@ hot .
if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD , so that he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is sim@@ pler , will immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with a low risk when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ ename or tag records , can be easily changed . the directory or file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter anything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , this is worth more than 620 MB . however , these two choices must be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the following map card .
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both work equal to the server , as many fire@@ walls do the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there is maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take over the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your host )
at the same time : exc@@ use , there is one reason why more than one drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folders for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances it is necessary to filter something to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ ction of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if required . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a Dual@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you don &apos;t need to change it again .
this topic describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each outing &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the screens@@ hot in a bit different than that for one &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b retri@@ eved data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of getting them from the Internet . comments are indicated on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD only needs to be pushed into the drive which has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; a window will appear and you can select the database entry that will suit your opinion the best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually release it manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but pick up the data from the Internet , you need the link to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Aktu@@ eller Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered into the input field &apos; Aktu@@ eller Title &apos; unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for each comments of ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following screen photo . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited length of field , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ satz tab ; you have a look at the &apos; Grund@@ Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later using tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see the Help button to get more information .
simply select one entry that obviously matches the style of the len@@ ght CD ; in this example , this is not important because we don &apos;t transfer the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window will not appear if you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . just click on the line automatically switches the selection of the piece one or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the button all the pieces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection of the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going out .
click on the tab to switch on the job window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for checking the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder is not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the start of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of high @-@ performance machines , the result is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is coded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the lower of your choice .

a program that calls many different programs has many options . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading this ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first time start of the program , without any indication of how it is going on , from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program start does not audio CD ; in the drive ) or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot refra@@ in from this manual . it is intended as a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator .
strange if you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time emphasis on texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project drivers that are required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included once it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window can be drawn on mid @-@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ us cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this works also with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry down from the menu piece or press the le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you prefer it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played afterwards . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ inter , and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button bar , like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry break in the menu piece , inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the le@@ ert@@ aste while no piece is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in one piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics suitable and again others . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don &apos;t have to manually set the entry automatic text selection . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , choose from the menu settings the entries text events or song events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can merge . these will be played by the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the menu collection under the point . click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set up the winning in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember that when you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . it again appears in the file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or select songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ established .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the list of the kar@@ aoke text .
to continue to jump a song , select the next song next song coming from the menu button or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song back , choose the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu button or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Delete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI . in this case the MIDI map General MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer is under@@ stands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always creates a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file which stores all necessary matches for the playback of a piece .
each section may appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired .

you see that DE@@ FINE is needed to show that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can be available in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patch of General MIDI to be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the par@@ ody is ignored . it is assumed that the GM options are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support an ad@@ mir@@ er ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , similar to a gun .
if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( shot@@ gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Drum @-@ Patch of the patch is meant to be a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with the sound the pitch of the same drum means ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the key@@ map section is needed to indicate how sounds are depicted on a particular channel or instrument .
as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as their presence . you must therefore create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names only in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the percussion channel . see for example the key@@ maps included .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , simply make sure that the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ OS section is easy .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns :
n is the channel that is shown on the N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used to use the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion gren@@ ade patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is to be multip@@ lied in what ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ end event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ fers that a keyboard that is a pitch @-@ end event will be played with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play a tone up to one oc@@ t@@ ave higher . in order to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are played exactly .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not illumin@@ ate more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds . the view in the Settings menu under the channel view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can result in very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file requires about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file 4 MB needs ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer , you can also change the different instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ s ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support has been compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
dis@@ agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
if you do not necessarily enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - Windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or want to play a file , simply switch to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and move the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn off automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening of files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so make the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ C. and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , you anim@@ ate me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I am studying mathemati@@ cs at the University of Ma@@ acute ; lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have lots of time for my hobbies , but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you make me really a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want anyone to get it for it . I want to empha@@ size that I just want to program , because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Tro@@ ub@@ leshooting of the defect that the pitch at A@@ WE @-@ cards was too high .

and of course my thanks also applies to all of these excellent musicians on the net , who give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , which is under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can see the development , search and view photos . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ WE board .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ U@@ AL , it will run as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send a notification directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files that supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional assistance please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; users Mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window which will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark feature , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Dau@@ ghter play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an extra hier@@ archy level . if you get an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and start playing with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current unit &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , choose the same with play@@ list from the menu and select either the editing mode or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable other animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ xml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ xml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation when starting boot doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be distur@@ bing during the end animation , but the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying your favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; img dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; /
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things .

there is no tab for this play@@ list in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , as the setting of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be played the special field video for YouTube in play@@ list XML .
to make the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is used in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages regarding loading the Browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
for example , this should be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the scanner needs to be used and the TV channels need to be used , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video Data Rek@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog box is in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be detected ( e.g. PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux ) . this is also only possible on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it needs to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internal are used by K@@ M@@ Player for sources of different names . at the time of the origin of this documentation , this is dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source source , source source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the play@@ list .
is there any hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play off from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as a user root after loading the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts slow down , why must every time be tested on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ t . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile ;
latex ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to use the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; te@@ Te@@ X ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users don &apos;t need to read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation should be desired , the contact should be made by the k@@ ile ; website .
any questions about or when comp@@ iling at &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ work@@ space . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphic interface and within this simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project administration .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its ways to learn , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
for &amp; latex ; is the right solution : lay @-@ TECH . while the ur@@ spr@@ Ã ¼ n@@ esser &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a La@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic experience is that it desc@@ ends from the last name of Leslie La mp@@ ort .
while there is only a good Ã ber@@ sicht to &amp; latex ; it is not the ultimate book . to allow &amp; latex ; properly master , for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
in the same way as other label languages include &amp; latex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text green will be set with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .

when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generates an empty line ( for instance \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ du@@ ous element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful . as soon as a DVI , file &#91; device independent file ) &#93; was created , j@@ umps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI , -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI @-@ file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is addition to PDF the respective output ear@@ t from &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing from DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the reset search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are dup@@ lic@@ ated and as soon as you cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI @-@ file , the exact opposite of it . as soon as on a section in the &amp; latex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the appropriate place in the DVI @-@ viewer is inj@@ ected .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . in using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set for project settings .
quick @-@ release : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .

the final selection field with the name of the franch@@ ise e is used for determining the font size . it can be specified for the main text , the print notes etc . there are the following fonts for the following :
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
as soon as the above source code has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ fs rapid construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing automatically .
if the comp@@ iling document fails , the logging should be searched for errors . if you use fast construction , &amp; ok@@ ular@@ line ; if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the changes will only be secured within the environment ( from \ \ begin { intermediate } to \ \ end { .. } ) . there is no restri@@ ction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to initi@@ ate the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , intensive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. are added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { EMP@@ H } : this command is for the intensive pressure and is as long as it is closed with \ \ end { EMP@@ H } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed with \ \ EMP@@ H { Word } .

after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; sign language , a step @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
as soon as the wizard has been given a bit of text , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be done . this should include a quote , a few places in the fat and intensive pressure and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the Editor view or C@@ trl E can be back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file .
this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI , file the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - you can print the document by printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI @-@ file into other formats . as soon as the DVI , file from the &amp; latex ; source code is created , the conversion into weigh@@ ted other formats can begin by using the pots in the tool@@ bar .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
in order to run the default search , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source text and can be cli@@ cked on preview search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI @-@ Viewer will then take place .
with this function in &amp; ok@@ ular@@ line ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI @-@ document , the corresponding &amp; latex ; document from &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ net and assigned to the appropriate line . to do this , &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ok@@ ular@@ ist ; in &amp; ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ) ... Editor )
if you are using fast @-@ release of the &amp; DVI or viewer , an error is available . if an error is available , this will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file is the source code in the source code . in the editor , the K@@ nÃ ¶ pfe previous La@@ Te@@ X error and modification of La@@ Te@@ X error may be used for j@@ umps between bugs . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , you must click on the error in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; navig@@ ating to the def@@ ective line .
once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the pres@@ et possibilities are :
if you choose empty document , a document can either be re@@ written or used for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , please refer to the section .
professional users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing ) . these variables can be set in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which characters are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by input in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ n class class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and thus verb@@ ose inser@@ tion of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps are completed :
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
a template can be created from any and latex ; it is a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ate ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;

when using the arrow keys , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to search and highlight the most varied types of source texts and empha@@ size them . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text has been added .
there is a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text with continuous lines ( like in other Tex@@ te@@ dit@@ ors ) . this advanced meaning fell by means of tables , and latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only prevent@@ ative thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the arrangements are separated by two empty lines .

it has already been suggested that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit Environment for a possible easy work with &amp; latex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to navigate around the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or within the command \ \ begin { environment } it is inj@@ ected at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many different environment commands , the Ã ber@@ blick cannot be lost . this command will close the last accessed environment , so that the missing environment structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to the Edit Environment .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the opening bracket .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the welded clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , it j@@ umps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many scre@@ ened groups brackets you can quickly lose the Ã ber@@ blick . this command will close the last accessed group so that the missing structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be dist@@ orted .
in &amp; Out , two simple fittings are used as bed @-@ holders . for the purpose of the application , the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple lines of application is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two Clos@@ ed An@@ fÃ ¼ r &amp; latex ; one .

although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source reference implementation , it was added in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . these are three according to demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different ways of setting up ...
in the beginning a new environment will be added to \ \ begin { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing at the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it will be connected to the most complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are natural for selecting a command . alternatively , from &amp; k@@ ile ; also spr@@ int marks can be activated , so that a simple jump to these positions can be activated by means of a spr@@ int mark possible and the used parameters will be activated .
under Pre@@ ferences k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . it can be used various walls of walls for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; instructions as well as walls of the general language used .
the command mode is not needed for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin , and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of the environments .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
after completing this , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is executed .

&amp; gt ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . this command line interface provides random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; for every day you use different signatures , such as the random signatures , create unique emails .
in order to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; blank signature ; in the section Sign@@ atures . click on the &amp; lt ; blank signature ; and paste it in the bottom section of your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file save or click on the disk@@ ette symbol .
you can create any number of signatures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails priv@@ ately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select them first and then Remove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red Cross Remove the tool@@ bar .
open the Short@@ cut dialog . here you can select short@@ cuts for menu items . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ xml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as sub@@ strate . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
every one who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation has been working , knows the pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s lift it a piece , we give it a graphic interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and ready !
this application expects a index.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index.@@ doc@@ book is in the w@@ alled working folder , then leave the current folder . if not , then remove the current folder of the folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when my pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the straight opened file index.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where index.@@ doc@@ book is found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is def@@ ective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file has already been checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then the current file can be easily attached . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - File Selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well defined , click the well @-@ defined check .
for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; , which is given in the &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the place of the &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and also for the Rel@@ ax@@ cation check , the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ xml@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , then the current file can be selected simply . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result is named to . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone builds the win@@ dow@@ ed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin with the Plug @-@ ins menu . thus , the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all included plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without one location is used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ ins .
often work on a project several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email items are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves as a clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of the team members who he is . this is done by searching the team member from the list and the button is pressed as pressed . the currently selected member ( your identi@@ fier ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leader if something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that will be executed when something is happening in the project . an example would be the record of opening and closing the project , so that later you can see how much someone worked , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the C@@ VS as soon as they are added to the project &amp; etc ;
events created , edited and deleted on the side of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the address data specified in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see if such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from ordinary comments by the following things :
ann@@ otation is simple . either the note entry can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation keyword in a commentary area followed by ann@@ otation .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the specified nick@@ name of the team member is to be given in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Head of Sub@@ project leaders .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for script and form@@ atting languages supported D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over some pages that will be treated after each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car complete compatibility , can be changed . entries are :
large / de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of tags : large / de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of automatically inserted tags . normal big / small case , the tags are inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of attributes : large / de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / small case , the attributes are inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : when connected , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; added .
not optional tags automatically close : as indicated above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update the start and finish tag : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using button standard , default specifications can be restored .
default string coding : the encoding of newly created or in other way as file opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting is generated from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD does not have been detected .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created periodi@@ cally backup copies so that when a power failure or crash can be restored the document from this backup can be restored . this is not the same as saving the file . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or an own view ( or documentation in a folder ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface is changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / dependency on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameters .
warning messages area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of war@@ nings by hooks of no longer queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source file in shared mode . regards the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree causes the following action to change the action by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ alization frequency of the tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means it can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plugins are part @-@ applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be specified :
address : the path to plugin , if it is not located at a standard location as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be passed to the plug @-@ in at start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refused to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should later be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the bug has been completely re @-@ developed . the support for the non @-@ needed built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger is set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin is implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points , with row numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view where the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action will be connected to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ code requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened using a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ on@@ ymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the view de@@ bu@@ gger output .
assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to start the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued .
assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script , and if possible in functions and include inside error .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to go to the instruction and go to the next so if there is not the current .
open a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered will be monitored . the supervis@@ ed value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to better become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbols @-@ oriented bars of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions qui@@ cker into a document when a user could ever be .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details for conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog@@ s , den &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick paste of tags to a document without a danger of typ@@ ing .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders contribute the name of the description language and version , so existing . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of tag XML and declared whether it is necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only be found in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains only element type above itself .
the type of the tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type property . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other tag . ( family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . in addition , it contains more tags that describe how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc ; This is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the source texts used in the tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments used to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only happen for a attribute description . it is an element type element .
sets the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can only happen once for each attribute in a dialog ( for example once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
there is the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is an element type .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window will start and select Tag@@ X@@ M@@ l. . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 tag XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function described . the fil@@ ename of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor to be re@@ achable via D@@ TD Bear@@ er D@@ TD settings . in this way di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
Transitional / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Transitional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... Click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned to this action assigned key short@@ cuts . clicking the User defined button can be assigned a button short@@ cut ; with K@@ ein the current button short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can enter a text in the Det@@ ai@@ li@@ ete settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start -@@ dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . this way attempts &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in command line :
% f : we &apos;ll be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script can take input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input , the default input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected Text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be changed . there are two types of issue : normal output , which is written on standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified , which is set to the standard output by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and if the tag attributes and you are planning their use , enable dialogue &quot; Tag &quot; when available to allow input when using the action .
ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic Other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select the others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
in view of that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ alized , or if you want to insert a message to the user , to insert a message to the current document .
after creating symbols , it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the An@@ gle button and continue with other tags , so there are still which , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar dialog via Settings tool bars . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I would like to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by proof@@ ing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will create a root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( if a file is opened from the appropriate type ) .
perhaps the most mentioned enhancement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; checking whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = Academic Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess shaft ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the construction supervision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but be sure &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ files are replaced .
the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used for the context of context sensitive help . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily store your file do@@ cr@@ c and save $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( how to specify it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that they are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. documentation used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud of having collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the fail@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else who are sent . at different places there is an E @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correctly and usable for publication .
when uploading your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case you have multiple keys , you can leave a search . in the New Resource dialog , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and clicking OK the upload .
upload the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installing , study &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and marking . in case of problems , it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed , a message appears with the name of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to automatically convert D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ et .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Transitional HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Fra@@ mes@@ et HTML 4.01 Stri@@ ct HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Fra@@ mes@@ et HTML 4.01 + R@@ DF@@ a 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 2.0
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and to understand full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , one must first be familiar with these fundamental concepts , without understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area divided into three areas : global , locally and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is selected as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development products for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the construction managers , the maps with information and tool bars . please note , and for further information about these areas .
you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all kinds of cards , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document .
right @-@ clicking in the editor area will lead to a further contex@@ tual menu concerning the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the file under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file if the string is named under the mouse po@@ inter .
at the top end of the editor window there are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Transitional is transi@@ tioned as standard for which a set of tool bars are shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; in their document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the construction managers ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and browse them . in the presentation with map tags , for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage media can be executed with the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category is dependent on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by links clicking a element , the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right clicking a element , a list of commands opens up a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ h@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears below the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project , project specific documentation can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cards at the bottom end of the window , can be reached using the useful information : the news window and the problem window .
this card reader shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . such as the D@@ TD of the current document and all modifications to D@@ TD are shown .
this card reader shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can backup them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; just like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H is in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus started to deal with a nearby idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up Language editor would be ? well , this would make it the most amazing Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; .
now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developing what has already been developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sm@@ st is not only possible , but allows users and developers to expand and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itting actions , scripts and tool bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way related to commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details of the documentation , help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a fast access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ pboard , it contains special characters to &amp; HTML , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ pboard in &amp; URL ; statement which is the correct way to paste special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switch the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; shift key ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP scripts are error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
training and inti@@ mid@@ ation of the problem rep@@ orter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you change the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
search the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have further input / output modules ( ki@@ o slave ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects can be found for details .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of the tool bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this will only create the name . actions must be saved using Settings actions ... or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows the upload of tool bars to the main server , where each other can access it . see in .
invite &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anyone has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refres@@ h of entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be resolved without ren@@ ew the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and not present in the global K@@ DE file , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins listed below are listed below the menu items listed above . click on . clicking on a plugin is disabled .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
choose the type of line end ID . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document by using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
Instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or un@@ fair graphics . recommended by the map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
changes in this dialog include any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
align@@ s the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add what can be changed and the sequences can be changed .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in the best from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project properties can be set .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name the file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adjustment should be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and want to change . in case of ser@@ vers@@ ing scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated . if a project is re @-@ started , not hook .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of no@@ od@@ les .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks , or by removing the bun@@ ny , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can upload files in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or change the Shift ; F@@ 7 button short@@ cuts .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) to re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
added option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views .
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
in the sub@@ window profiles you can upload high loads ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out its own supervision for each profile .
in the Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see for details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can turn event actions and add or delete event actions , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously certain event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be affected at the moment .
to open a different project , select project ... from the Project or symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the Project Open dialog will appear and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; modified files will find . same happens if you load a new project .
the project management supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behavior , however , the entries open and open with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will fall down to prevent removing .
this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the upload .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high loads are created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will appear :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will function .
the transfer protocol for uploading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slave . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your spru@@ e threshold , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use them according to your discre@@ tion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easy , but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of the view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , which can be accessed or deleted by the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adap@@ ting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own working method .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best over the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . use and add addition to the tool@@ bars . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be adjusted either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool bar can be created , and other actions like tool@@ bars remove , ren@@ ame tool bar or tool@@ bars , which should be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars are to be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings tool bar ... and setting actions .. Set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code @-@ car@@ ving and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a simple file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or move any of the existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you can see for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are normally inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with img src = / src / url ) .
documents can be created from any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents in appropriate sub@@ folders can be created .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see also for more information about the template tree .
as the name says , these templates are used for complete websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File Recovery as a local template .
once it is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File Save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , select the option with drag and drop to the supervis@@ ed template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into one template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project file tree view to a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the template . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ fix he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , paste files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders represents one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behaviour of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click the folder and select Properties tab . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is termin@@ ated as soon as El@@ der attributes are inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the main folders in the template Overview . if a root folder would be set in such a way , the bla@@ h would appear in this path , unless they were explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear as a text @-@ tree . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder .
allows pre @-@ created or recre@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying content templates into a folder containing special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the right he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders , or copy and paste from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be re@@ achable through the menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second partition the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and turn back to source code in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green icon shows the presence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode is just like the first one , except that the changes are visible in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor in sync . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast machines and a large chip for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website so that the editing of invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also possible . the document properties dialog will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this means that you can change the following :
meta tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click in the list allows change of the content , e.g. keywords at the column name and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to create pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is just like with the Meta elements . editing CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the button and select the corresponding file .
using the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is beha@@ ved as usual .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags have already inserted an existing tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed from any other surrounding An@@ ker tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table assistant or the list assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; later in this release , the tables or lists tool bars are used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ ot@@ g ; is a tool for checking style templates . unlike other programs for style templates , search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be tra@@ ced .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ ot@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ xml , which are already existing at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing .

x@@ sl@@ ot@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ ename without path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the upper@@ most loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder with x@@ sl@@ .@@ x@@ sl , is possible to enter the following input :

on systems with installed Read@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys to / from the log memory of the previously executed commands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to commit compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as argument is a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; let me explain why I wrote .
the mer@@ ger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes , and at the same time corrected many changes at the same time . another progra@@ mmer had a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within that line . and there were no hints at the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many other useful functions were added .
if you want to compare the text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ pboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparison and mer@@ ging of folders . this feature turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ sized file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when selecting the correct changes . in this editor , you can even edit the results directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you when comparing and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and di@@ stract the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anno@@ y@@ ance anymore if you change the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files have the same name but in different folders , then you can complete the ti@@ p@@ par@@ b@@ eit by typ@@ ing only the file name of the first file . example :
1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@
opening dialog allows to manually enter file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , you can use a folder , for B and C , but a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify a output file at once . you can also get this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text items from the cli@@ pboard into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the break button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two appropriate files in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and compare them . now you can easily copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you are not able to extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drop down text in a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the dra@@ gging and editing text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the upper part of each text window is the info line . the information line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional ) .
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , you can see the color that distingu@@ ishes it . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. are white characters only in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few rare instances . )
the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line will be dotted around broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the wording edition : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; modified &#93; if you have worked the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the most solved / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group will then be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and a black bars appear on the left .
sometimes through automatic mer@@ ging or manually editing , no further row is left in the group ; then in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the source is displayed ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you may change your opinion and maybe another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and paste it elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; clas@@ h of clas@@ hes ; however , appears in the cli@@ pboard if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the Options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ end , as you can also use it from other programs .
you can also use the other keys for editing . using the Insert button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section and the editing window has been declared ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ unten / C@@ trl @-@ top ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ unten / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to cli@@ pboard , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy the cli@@ pboard and remove the manual copy . be careful , because you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of cli@@ pboard .
new@@ sl@@ et@@ ters are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix variants are using a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wag@@ en@@ reverse + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the fil@@ ing of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved and restored when the next start is restored . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to select , you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in a funny script . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be displayed . at these systems the button Pre@@ ferences automatically adjust@@ s an odd color .
if this option is enabled , pressing the tab@@ ulator key will inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
when entering or return , the return of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to cli@@ pboard . manually copy the cli@@ pboard .
you can select which type end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally common selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page compar@@ atively look identical although they are different . if this option is enabled , you will be de@@ activated . if this option is enabled , this option will be de@@ activated .
in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are shown , but they are treated as white characters .
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
the option is activated in default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic rest@@ ling mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
automatically tri@@ ggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the functions W@@ äh@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and exec@@ uting a mer@@ ging . check for details below documentation to the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if already such a backup file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust@@ s the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and rest@@ art to change the change . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
the selection fields for coding appears a brief hint that is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a pure informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the Options ignore or Ign@@ or@@ iere C / C + + -@@ comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color coded over@@ sight column will appear . but sometimes you may just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C will appear next to the normal or a second super@@ sich@@ ts column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply make the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . a simple click starts the compilation and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements .
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be used when entering the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor which matches exactly your requirements . each input line needs to have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases it is sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processor to convert the input into upper case letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword substitu@@ tion ) .
while you experim@@ enting with sed you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing order for new@@ sl@@ et@@ ters . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit will be replaced by nothing but virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several things at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the translations from each other . for example :
you can also use per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / substitu@@ tion / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; aller@@ gen are in per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the default &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ gleich @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line ab@@ brevi@@ ation pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders are recur@@ sively compared and merged .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and displays the simulated changes without actually doing it .
... sel@@ ects selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the comparison and mer@@ ging of individual files very similar . you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message box on current progress . if you want to scan the folder , only the files are listed , which have been compared until then .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions View all sub@@ directories and fold all sub directories with which you can open all folders .
if you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the interaction design will not be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical when you are not identical . then you also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option is synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees the visible file name for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged together and select the newer file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ certain ) , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and propos@@ es the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. if such errors are not fixed , the merge directory cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , a file will be executed after the other . the status column demonstrates how it was successful , and according to other messages , if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is fine everywhere .
this includes the number of un@@ solved , dis@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resol@@ ving conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
note : if you do not have a target folder , it will be used as a destination in the three folder combination mode C as a destination , using the two folder merge B as destination and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( button short@@ cuts ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid combination actions , a message appears on the def@@ ective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Ext@@ ending , Sim@@ ulating and Break@@ ing .
select Sim@@ ulate when you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a mer@@ ging window will open ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
if you are ready with a file , select re@@ boot / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a bug , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you want to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue to merge with the merge .
if some entries were individually compiled , you see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and exec@@ utes them in later execution of all entries . even if the mer@@ ger has been ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries will be merged again . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignore files that would also be ignored by C@@ VS . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder specifically can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default setting .
for links to folders : when the option is turned off , the links like normal folders will be treated and re@@ kur@@ siv . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible records . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible records . ) This option is turned off in the default setting .
provides complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns . ( the number of dis@@ solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ sample . )
if you compare large folders on a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the ch@@ angel@@ ing date and file size . however , this speed benefit cost you a certain level of security .
similar to tru@@ sting the ch@@ angel@@ ing date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful for instance when copying the ch@@ angel@@ ing date . please use caution . this option is reset in default setting .
activ@@ ates syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is turned off in the default setting .
if there are differences , it will be proposed instead of mer@@ ging the copying of the newer file as action . ( this is assumed as un@@ certain , because it is assumed that the other file has not changed also . you should check this in any case . ) This option is turned off in the default setting .
if a file or folders will be replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig@@ . this option is turned on in the default setting .
normally the folder merge file remains visible to the merge of single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also use a single file directly without having to run the folder together . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder together .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with ki@@ o slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening files located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
a path can be relatively und@@ one . or .. contains . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be cas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( note that this is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently the differences spect@@ ator at K@@ Devel@@ op . AD@@ BA first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the comparison of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ ars ) there are already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I am using G@@ PL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by st@@ ating into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or go on it .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not specified the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure the configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the same .
the editor not@@ ices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for this has been too big . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src was left ; published and the text can &apos;t delete . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and lack the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems when comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift _ remove ) to cli@@ pboard and del@@ etes the selected text . paste ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from the cli@@ pboard to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you must re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
if the target folder does not contain these files , it will be modified later . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in the default setting .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed accordingly when clicking the button .
in the default setting this option is disabled . differenti@@ als in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , change it or move them . this works both within a desktop and at several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop and display applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and other .
the middle mouse button can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when clicking on the empty back@@ drop of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager . if you click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimum , Maxim@@ ize , On the Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window onto the full size of the desktop . only appears when you cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when clicking on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop .
if this field is crossed , the name of the virtual desktop is displayed .
cross this field , the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of the virtual desktop . if it is enabled along with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , eg ; 1st working area .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rect@@ angles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual work@@ spaces are known in a vertical and vertical line , which is very good for the presentation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display and move the window as symbols or with their content . moreover , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select Shift switches ... let the dialog appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in dialog settings . however , you can manually perform this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; k@@ edit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you need to login as user root or turn to your system administrator .
as &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag , a part of the screen , so as if you would like to read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : it includes artists , web designers and people with visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which constantly extends to new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . the picture shown in the magni@@ fication window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting increases &amp; k@@ may ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as a mo@@ vable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse po@@ inter . please note that &amp; k@@ ite ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse po@@ inter .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse po@@ inter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can insert and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; shift key , press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the window will remain firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the larger image directly to the printer in a file to copy it into the cli@@ pboard ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window .
&amp; gt ; automatically utili@@ ze your short@@ cut short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ line ( with the button document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
it may also be known as &amp; k@@ screw fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ screw fier ; use a magni@@ fying area to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the cur@@ sor wa@@ its for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click p@@ ains pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse po@@ inter under@@ stands a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and which every mouse click p@@ ains ache .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that comes in clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , due to the naked moving of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet .
in order to clari@@ fy it once again : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid pain caused by moving the mouse is useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can fall for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and carries a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
if the smart move is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before leaving the mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used quickly .
this residence time must be c@@ ited after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click the mouse click .
if Intelligent sliding is switched on , the shooting field is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button again , the mouse button is left again when the mouse button is left again when no moving the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supports clicking on the left and back , followed by a pause , one click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back takes a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the tab . there is a slide control sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at the moment , this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button , the settings are reset to the last pressing of attachment .
the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should first be switched off . if you are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first , you should make aware of which places a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or spots in the browser window that does not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can use the mouse to use such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ ling , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse over , but also the wheels that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse over . as this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the lo@@ ches in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system termin@@ ates the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use an intelligent moving process in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by letting the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but par@@ ken the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input .
I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I do not manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy and paste it into the cli@@ pboard or to insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead : perform a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while holding the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and again press the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . the mouse button expres@@ ses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when smart moves the fade @-@ up time . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test expansion for &amp; X @-@ window must be installed . this should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is dist@@ orted . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and prepar@@ es the pressing of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a particular time waiting for a go@@ l process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way it can also be carried out with the mouse .

with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of phrases that will be discussed again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command which will later be used for the voice output of text . for more details please refer to the description of the setup dialog@@ s .
on the second page , select the default text @-@ size text@@ book . you can often choose from the text password files without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can naturally be edited .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can subscribe to the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially a input field for the keyboard input of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and a slow memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ orted memory . you can select phrases that should be discussed again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ fz ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the page of Wor@@ ter@@ box and the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service .
in the input field of the map card language edition you will enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you set the string encoding that will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for speech output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the attachment .
if that is successful , the other settings will be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if that is successful , the other settings will be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . the desktop language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications are a standardis@@ ed interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the button short@@ cut or by selecting a passage in the Text pass@@ age@@ buch menu or in the bar for text pass@@ age@@ books .
the selected text passage is directly spoken and added to the storage device . the selected passage will only be inserted into the input field .
with the second selection box , close the editing window for text @-@ pass@@ age@@ buch , you can specify whether the text in the editing pane should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
the text password record is stored in the selection of text files . if you choose any changes , the text password record will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ box is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ box page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word processing . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary to choose the word .
with buttons on the right hand side , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries to change the order of the books or exp@@ orting them into a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary below the list .
for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ de ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by count of the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be weigh@@ ed .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically translate into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ age@@ books is divided into two sections . in the upper part , the text @-@ matching hand@@ ker@@ chi@@ efs are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or associated short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text@@ log book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books can be reached either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fold @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ wort holes or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ pboard . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected parts of the folder will be used .
the selected text is copied to cli@@ pboard . if a text section is selected in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected parts of the folder will be used .
the currently active pro@@ position is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the folder storage .
if this menu entry is enabled , a mo@@ vable tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar by default , by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and to@@ es the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with reference about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar is displayed with entries . the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar by default via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and to@@ es , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you don &apos;t have the command for voice output properly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the site General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Spanish are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival in the folder / usr / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently it supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the set of speech output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etz . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option data must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ one@@ tics into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option data is sent as default input must be enabled .
the Language @-@ Edition D@@ äm@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
as the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ ebox .
for setting up the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional storage for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak of text by the computer . a list of already saved pro@@ positions can be saved , which the user can always re@@ write again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the machine a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ pboard or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the ticket orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map sheet and check voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text you want to read , and select the text you want to read . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; head@@ lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text you want to read . then check the text you want to read , and select the text you want to read in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this works even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; that you noti@@ fied about the events specified by you . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IRC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set different types of messages . you can create &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up a message when entering a IRC channel in which your Nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can read the IRC message text .
a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , appears a menu entry aler@@ ts in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ xml , which is supplied by &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags , and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed to be assumed as pres@@ umed . read also .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
it is useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to choose a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ maker &quot; works with a text . &amp; t@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will res@@ ume again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will res@@ ume after the issue of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message is breaking regular text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ ebox ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; aler@@ ts are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you encounter from the map card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four job types are handled in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
drawing replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the items to replace are delivered either as a word or a regular expression . it is delivered with pre@@ defined drawing tools such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ form@@ atting messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use an XSL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery , some XSL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaking selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice for example on the card board , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules for which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a notification , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be processed by all the activated filters which have been set up on the side . processing through the filter is done in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be de@@ activated from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and the next configuration dialog@@ s are displayed below .
for the setup of drawing tools you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference pattern . if these samples are found in the text , the text is ex@@ changed in the text .
specify a name for your filter . you can select this name as you like , it must be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string from the column .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker writes one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ trl ; key .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; DB@@ us ; numbers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you can only copy it .
the design filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box use the filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison to words , the design filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s \ \ \ s \ \ s \ \ s \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; transform@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using XSL@@ T files from a format to another format . XSL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be installed on well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c help program must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map editor , or to a speaker with certain features . you can for example set that texts are supposed to be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is handed over to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker features that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker selection filter is selected by the speaker selection filter . the speaker selection filter can be over@@ written by the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are installed , you can call this by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
if the text reaches the above mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button to see the dialog selection dialog .
use these buttons to store or store your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box use the filter when apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with the programm@@ ers can l@@ end their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; DB@@ us ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , added with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; these syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ DB@@ us ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility Website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request speech output via the &amp; DB@@ us ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
text of text to read , and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you enter
open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . start first in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ Filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone that SA@@ BLE works at all . that &apos;s why you do not need to do this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or interference marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ing wel@@ ds . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure the option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string setup filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the web pages . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package of k@@ de@@ acces@@ sibility with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will find the source code of acces@@ sibility under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the htt@@ p : / / speci@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
KT@@ TS works with every voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , check the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not contained in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ph@@ antom power &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and extend the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the pack@@ ets k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; ph@@ antom power . &quot;
if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ acces@@ sibility or downloaded every night currently created t@@ arb@@ all , install the program using the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first whether he is working correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; quot ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; quot ; which is used to use the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed so that the set of speech states is directly feasi@@ ble and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ lod@@ ged in single sentences . the user may withdraw articles or reject rates , keep the issue or cancel the issue .
if you use text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can specify the properties of the preferred subscri@@ ber for output . if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suited speaker . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is selected , you can see in .
if you click on the map editor to add , and to add a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the map card is shown . as an example , the module will be shown below the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival in PAT@@ H is included , you must enter only festival .
select the text to be handed over to the festival . with voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages are used to use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 .
with these sliders , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regulator and display this grey , the selected voice does not allow you to select these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is faster than the first set .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet assigned a spokes@@ person ( or forget to click on contact ) . see .
if this check box is marked , the t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ sm@@ gr will appear in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to keep reading or otherwise .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e queu@@ e , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID of the board ID .
the buttons in this series can be set in the order that is selected in the list below , advance or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . Edition of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component can not be selected , it has been designed &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ ts ; it cannot load the necessary libraries .
if there is no output modules in the list , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , choose the PC@@ M device . see also
set the inter@@ com speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click Apply to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of the AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card you can set up special promotions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and holds these orders . after the issue of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders will be res@@ umed .
warning stops the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will res@@ ume after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that talks about messages . if you write &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone gre@@ ets someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if the sound as well as the introduc@@ tory message is active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen re@@ eds there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read and write K@@ not@@ fy messages , start t@@ sm@@ gr and click to noti@@ fications . the map card noti@@ fications are published .
select this check box to switch to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication devices . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; de@@ activated ; do not read any noti@@ fications .
if this setting is marked , notification when a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IRC message .
all events specified in the list are ignored by &amp; quot ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is specified for a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All Noti@@ fications for Application Standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list ) . you can specify the previ@@ ew@@ ing noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to store the settings for aler@@ ts into a file . use the button to store saved settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Delete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML contains only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the standard voice that uses SS@@ ML output .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit@@ ing filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds are subject to text in individual movements . this can be &amp; quot ; faster with pre @-@ read , because only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the stat@@ ute recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can change your settings or add additional stat@@ ute recognition filters , but beginners will be advised of it .
on the simpl@@ est way , you will learn the setup of the microphone selection by trying out . turn off the microphone selection and enter text for pre @-@ reading . do not change the microphone selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . for this you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can apply text orders on the map card orders or can reply , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set of rules are automatically set up if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , unless you do not change anything to that filter , unless you know what you do .
set the stat@@ ute recognition filter for text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set boundaries . note that the standard set recogni@@ z@@ able filter ret@@ ains the character of the set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed the normal set of stat@@ ute recognition filters , you can paste it again by load the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the map card selection selection you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the map card Speaker ) . in other words , there are no speaking abilities .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which shows all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; store ; the speaker , who is most likely to choose the originally set of features .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking one of the buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this tick box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor when the issue is published , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may possibly want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application is sent in another language as the selected in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker , the closest to the following is to delete , click on the standard speakers , and then use the speaker that is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is available for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any tra@@ ce@@ ability .
if the problem is not solved this is probably not a compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stream@@ er . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stream@@ er .
the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application music . if I keep a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; a message that says : t@@ am to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is a problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / reci@@ ve the new voice . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer .
on the map card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and can be found on the PAT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ thesizer @-@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive can offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely bold , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; - after @-@ SS@@ ML remo@@ ver filter , and set the talk speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not work . this festival does not produce any errors , th@@ rows the x@@ sl file for converting SS@@ ML to SA@@ BER the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have added a separate string of tools and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the order is shown , the order consist only out of a sentence . what do I do wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
points ( point , question mark , character mark , Kom@@ ma and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for the set limit detection instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA Con@@ flicts in the audio issue . if your system counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and write a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; fri@@ ert a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you consider a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setup of speaking speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included .

if this folder is not installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example
on Debian system , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location .
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first whether your voice syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help to find the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in Festival / lib / Mac / rus@@ sian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ lli@@ c ( 8 @-@ Bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , you will be looking for the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be adjusted to a 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ lli@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you will need additional software to create this Di@@ phone .
with this procedure additional wra@@ pper code will be added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first you install the festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then you download MS German Festival
assign@@ ments can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the inclusion of error correc@@ tions is not required , you need to re@@ translate the Festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .
( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; ) ( voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 3 _ os &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; )
on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al.@@ sc@@ m . add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the right path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual work the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices are not working with I@@ MS German Festival .
this process uses special code to select the language about Festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and install and install the festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then you invite Festival @-@ Czech
un@@ pack the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file has to be in your PAT@@ H .

Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered voice syn@@ thesizer that currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with an even adequate voice quality .
Fli@@ te is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search for the CDs of your distribution .
H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ step voice syn@@ thesizer with dialog@@ s . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice syn@@ thesizer generates the sound . the voice quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages .
download at least one German language file from the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip in the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file name .

start t@@ ms@@ g . click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS voice syn@@ thesizer . if the Epo@@ s programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the programs on the map card Speaker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; e@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed can be set .
the command module enables you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled on the command line .
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet and network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all indicates and setting the network properties .
in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices with installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option of network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings it tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be identified , the selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that is best suited to the distribution and the release date . by selecting non @-@ recur@@ ring requests , the definition can be made permanently . the next step of the network settings will then be selected automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode on the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available .
the tabs network interface is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed .
setting up selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... in the Set dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are made for the system at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list you can select either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system .
you can specify the TCP / IP address with the selection manual without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must specify the TCP / IP address .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at the boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off a switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . off @-@ enabled network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ nets .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain specification by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS det@@ ects this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records may be added , removed or modified . DNS records may be re@@ arranged in the list with the buttons of Hin@@ auf or Her@@ mit in the priority list .
clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be displayed in the New Name Server dialog .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution select one entry and then click the Edit button .... It will be shown dialog Edit .
the list of known computers describe host name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used in the boot when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
usually the list of known computers contain some entries , which &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known host has several alias names , the button add one more times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will be displayed .
it can be one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . simply download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution can be used .
the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient for this case ; not only , but also the development packages with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on basic network technology , in the second , all of them are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files are discussed .
this section will not replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this attachment only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
at present , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be in the near future . this description is therefore focuss@@ ed on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowledge of which IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the response of a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded to the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , the access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses are used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers large enough .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of your own computer ) . the standard route is required for the IP transmission .
the 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to a specified lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file sometimes changes dynam@@ ically , so it is not surprising if active DSL connections can be found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in the Su@@ SE@@ config file . another stand as expected can occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar , which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , sel@@ ective un@@ packing . the second goal was answering a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ stores the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing on the band will be asked if the band should be form@@ atted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the right index on your disk . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the band can now be searched through fl@@ aps of the entry for the band .
prior to designing the belt , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without any danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted .
a band file must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it is necessary to form@@ atted a band before use . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require form@@ atting of the band , D@@ AT drives do not have to be form@@ atted .
after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the band . all data on the band are lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process , the band will automatically be integrated and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select the Save Files menu .
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box opens up . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the Backup dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in an entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the item entry Test ...
once the testing process has been started , the dialog box displays for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you restore the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only be the selected file or the sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Edit menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band@@ spread . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder where the backup should be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only those files located on the same file system are found that are located on the same file system , as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ esystem can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the other .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files are backed up since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes that all files are backed up and created a new snapshot file for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the settings can be set via the menu item to set up ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , load to the drive . in some drives it is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection in the belt drive . possibly this setting does not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , when the integration of &amp; k@@ dat files , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ der block size for the belt drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drive will be reported in each case .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only record a memory block on the band . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , with the host@@ name of the full name of the system on which the volume has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ atted since the era in which the volume was form@@ atted .
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives that can be used directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar -@@ versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is intended for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system supports the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system is stored in the various protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some advanced features try to be filtered and analyzed by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sys@@ log server and Samba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screens@@ hot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with their help to easily filter and sort the single protocol rows of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start attempts &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open . if you don &apos;t see this , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log , which is probably not associated with system wal@@ let rights . the protocol files can normally be found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually no justi@@ fication for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected crit@@ erion or after entered string . the list of the log messages will now be modified , so that only the log messages will be displayed next to the filter . in default , a protocol line will only be displayed if one of the columns contain the filter .
you can also select another entry in this place . in the log file system log , you can select the column process , for example , in the protocol file system log the column process , and also carry out the name of a process , so you will show &amp; k@@ system@@ log , all log lines which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . record lines of stage errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as log lines of level indication . the color representation of log lines can be turned off .
if you want to show certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to ski@@ p to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu , in order to view all new record lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display it in the menu .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing into the control of the program starts when driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it without having a new installation and re @-@ form@@ atting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there .
Sys@@ V In@@ it diff@@ ers from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to run when you exit the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only once started .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even though it is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches for different points after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and edit the 3 . if you have something confused , then you can repair it by rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called stop . if he involves a S , the script will start the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , which is only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user run@@ level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag one entry from the field of availability of system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts also between run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere . this is only done by removing an entry from the area of disposi@@ tion system services .
note : entries will be moved if you prefer to copy them into a new realm . to copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and in the target area inser@@ tion -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ption number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ti@@ cians of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator key to enable the various work@@ spaces ( quit system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ pboard ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ ummer or the name of an entry manually , press the button to change the properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ulator key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept changes , or press Es@@ c to reject the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before being executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restor@@ ing changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input key to start in a single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have done some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions will simpli@@ fy the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available that are needed from the system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply quit without notice when their configuration files are not present or w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation relates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , user and user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the group with a double click on the entry .
some maps are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have been enabled for user settings , a map card will be created if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD @-@ uni@@ xes are installed .
the password management card will appear if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD @-@ uni@@ xes are installed .
this map card will only appear if for at least one integrated file system restri@@ ction ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the restrictions in KB are :
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with limited space restri@@ ction .
the host card groups inform@@ s about the group &apos;s belonging to the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , will be found in the Prim@@ äre Group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Add the User or Group or click the tool@@ bar button . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the boot password , add and modify the boot password , add and modify the time to the boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
