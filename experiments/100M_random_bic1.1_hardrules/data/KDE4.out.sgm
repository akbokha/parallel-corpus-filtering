<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in the & konqueror; -menu under Tools website. select the initial and target language of the translation from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated as part of the entire & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Automatic translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case. therefore, the translations do not make important decisions depending on the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page yourself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making it easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror; select Settings Add-in extensions.... Open the map tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings modules from the package kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install kdebase package, the & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to use the crash module, click on & konqueror; on extras. then you can view the page, which & konqueror; for crash, or the list of crashes when present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called folder filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools view filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in the & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and therefore open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root nodes of the document, for example: design element, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & fsview; for & konqueror; provides a further view of objects with MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative to the various symbol and text views, in order to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & fsview; the size of a file or folder is mirrored, with the size of a folder as the sum of the entries in it. this way, large files, even then easily recognized when they are located far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & fsview; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; an entry in the TreeMap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over color mode can be either depth for the light detection of the shading depth or the image of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be created with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if sufficient space is available, or if the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and thus display errors due to limitations of the TreeMap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps it should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the TreeMap in & fsview; this goal is not always respected.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries will be left to the implementation. here it is possible for the labelling and avoidance of space losses due to the context that rectangles are created which are as square. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns, or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum order area for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a pattern pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-ordered order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & fsview; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="56">& digikam; contains a fast editing tool with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugin interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16 bit colour gamut and all available modules support the conversion through libraw, DNG-Export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata such as & eg; over the camera or lens that can be sought.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it's reliant on the support of the end users. they should therefore report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the melding of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains one entry problems or wishes.... This opens a dialog with a signed link. if you are using these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to answer any questions to other users of & digikam; and hopefully you will soon be able to answer any questions of other users. in this mailing list, however, you should be more powerful in this mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; homepage to learn about freed versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digikam; for the first time you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the file name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abbreviation is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digikam; will also be used as an AlbenLibrary.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the uppermost folder that contains images as a base folder.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; thirst rekursiv the library path throughout the depth. you can't exclude subfolders unless it's iste in hidden folders. this allows you to insert extradiaries & digikam; by inserting a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList have no photos as symbols. you can change the change by taking any photo from the album and lay it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the basic folder, you can set up your digital camera; then you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported crux cameras in the help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; of course every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device.</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos generally are large files and transfers over the serial port, this connection is outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with gPhoto2.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so the preview images of digibar can be read out reliably. if the thumbnail support does not exist in libgphoto2, you may not see previews or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to digikam is how easy to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">Kipi module: the KDE Image plugin Interface Project (Manual) is a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all the graphics programs. the settings for the kipi modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, and digikam; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; remove or change the full screen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and laying images works everywhere: you can place a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, data list or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a data type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filename works on the file name only if this ind is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistee; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos provided by & digikam; are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folder where they are stored on the hard disk, according to the name of their collection in the Albenches or after the date on which the album has been created first, sorted by the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Imported images. you can also scan a screenshot directly to an album. choose album Importing screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down. you can move or copy the image by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to click on the album and select the album title properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a shared name. if you want to add or delete a collection from the toolbar or want to delete a collection, you can make it in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view and sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, new ester: these put the date on the date of the oldest, the newest picture or the section of the album. this is first attempted to calculate the average of pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first come up an album in & digikam; open the first picture in the album as symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteer; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select a different photo as the album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As a album list, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be worn.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My keywords list links below in the main window. album collections have another effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window displays the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will appear in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you must wait for short while the preview images are generated. this can prevent you from creating all preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each picture is shown below the corresponding preview. what information is this, you can set up digikam; set up. select the albums and adjust the area preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The preview images have help window, the appearing. if you leave the mouse cursor a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screen shot at the top in the introduction into the main window shows such a help window.</seg>

<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the submenu.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image processing programs can come to problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the simplest way is to click on the preview and select the rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved into the Mülleimer of & kde; postponed. F8 Image Deleting or Entf If you prefer to erase you, you can use this by using Shift; Entf.</seg>

<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data window so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. keywords are stickers, which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the picture may be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been selected with this keyword will appear.</seg>
<seg id="111">You can also log in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords, too. you can also create parts of the tree & quot; My keywords, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The parser implementations we used for this check are based on OpenSP (SGML / XML) and libxml2 (XML).</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking on & quot; My stitch password; or on an existing keyword, and then select new keyword here. if you have clicked a new keyword after you clicked on an existing item, this is the sub-word of this keyword.</seg>

<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you have chosen with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My stitches; alternatively, you can click on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can create a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you have one of the keywords you assigned to it. on this way you can get a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keywords, this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the Tags menu. the menu shows you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find a certain photo without inventory management longer. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digikam;. the approach to save metadata in a database as well as image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving solution that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before making any changes to your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to change it to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly about your location unless you were in a year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archive and 5% work files and you will then not want to re-organise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the site of the metadata in & digikam; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what is happening? to do this, & digikam; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign any photo keywords, restrictions and an assessment. of course you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now with keywords, keywords as you are frequently called in other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogzed images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or put the pictures to the right place. the change of hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by pulling a substrate to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata can overlap. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data have properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalogue your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then start to see some details, people, the square.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this one of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beach quot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream, associations, memories, the historic time period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others that view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning of the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it is the strength only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can place a lot of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as inscription. you can even expose it for a selection of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light velocity.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use Geolocalization are already innumerable and will be more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips with geographic information. & digikam; you can also export kml files using Google Maps. you can also export kml files using Google Maps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and marks the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, for example to protect the name of the photographer, for example to protect the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support Kommas nor Semikolons as a separator.</seg>

<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who wants the photo. this must not be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here if the picture is a store photo, then the group / agency will be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill in the author and copyright-sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with computer can delete or change the solution for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for individuals and professionals.</seg>

<seg id="177">Topics: plate failure, record loss, current storms, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper portraits or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics, which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs you need to be careful and you can no longer trust you than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archived quality, which are more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers about Gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for himself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording equipment and make them in the right way. the best DVD recording equipment are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you are just first written. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. in spite of this massive protective, they are protected by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently causes miracles to CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged disks, hard disks, flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to be winning the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. also, you should store the media with a description, date & author mark and then on a clean, dark dry and on animals protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discrepancies retain your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the failure mechanisms of hard drives: disability study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks are the longest when you run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in lower temperature contours, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot find this error.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files, but these losses can usually recover without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not far up, the devices with computer chips and high-speed processes are different. this can cause heavy damage. on your computer, these anomalies may cause locked keys, complete data loss, hardware alteration, hardware alteration, damaged motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy mattress and removes the rest. it is normally available in the form of a connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals that are connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers put over voltage contactors, which also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a non-interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting from overvoltage, these devices can automatically make battery energy available when a power failure occurs. some models allow them to continue working until the current runs. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they are able to purchase the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the battery life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">This is only a small price difference if you think how well your computer is protected. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you start your holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are compared to the hard disks at home, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. moreover, you have to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com are available online storage services. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution Online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should only be verified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and distributed storage. thus, they are desaster.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs make sure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive is safe.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disruptions remain uncovered until you have been destroyed in your computer. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source for transmission losses, since they generate intereferences within the data streams. in normal filing systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission issues, you should look into the future. already 2010, you'll see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle panel defects on low level. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one for the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>

<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the widespread file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process during operation is higher and a undefined status is avoided. if a file is not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries. this is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high-quality optics, the sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their border with 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk is available today for 100 & euro; therefore, do not worry others for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by any data loss. therefore, make sure your data is much more dangerous than the new installation of your operating system, replacing plates or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you do every day your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash hits you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget Aircraft: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually involve a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for data loss despite securing panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files must be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential security: a backup of files have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two timestates: the complete backup and the last differential security.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made. this backup comes with a versioning system on the next one with the exception that it is only deserted and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete check.</seg>

<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and reevaluate as time. unfortunately there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explaining the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability, and you want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store them to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command whether your new record has been detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& lt; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore no longer use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was able to replace GIF as an open source standard, but it can store much more. it is less lossless, supports XMP, exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. it is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open raw image format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. it can be saved separately from the image file. however, it can be problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as indicated above, the raw format is split. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which supports a wide range of applications and business models. in the activities of DCMI, the work on an architecture and modelling, discussions and community work in the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broader acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, card reader or scanner. so long the images on the camera name are used, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your blank menu. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing, you can use external programs. if you restore the images again with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them into web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the section adding a photo to a album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam, connect it with the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and switch it. a further description will be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. in some cameras it may take a while. if the connection is made, a skill indicator appears at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to view camera information at any entry. with the side panels properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single application or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as in the metadata page strip from the main window of & digikam; or the image slider. note that these metadata can not be available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button and then select all the photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam; downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the chosen selection methods of & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the button download and then select the selected. the button Selected is long as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have been selected until now not by & digikam, downloaded. in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons all download or selected selected, a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos will be sorted. the list of existing albums will be sorted in which the photos will be sorted. select the target album from the list and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, click OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photographs, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete Clear All Delete. if you want to delete a few, you must first select them first and use Delete Selected Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successful in a & digikam; album downloaded before you want to delete them from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually reutilized after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can cause duplicate file names if you upload photos of different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it may be useful, the date and time when the image has been made to the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date-based subcategories. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer opens three other options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied to the IPTC files. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to format a different file format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% d% H:% M:% M:% M:% M:% M:% M. turn on the Add date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option of camera filenames, you have the option to change the file name in small case letters. or in uppercase case if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digikam; used for a photo, is shown below the name that the camera is available in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when opening the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page toolbar Metadaten you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally enabled, and if your camera doesn't provide this information, it can be digitized; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is using information about the date on which the photo has been made available, it can be downloaded and digikam; these sub-albums are loaded in the same subalbum. all images with the same date will be uploaded to the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in section page toolbar meta data you can read what information you have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case it stores & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the button extension and select the date-based sub-ben option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button downloading. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is completed, asks & digikam; you, where the pictures are to be loaded. select the desired folder and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position meant to be displayed in length and width graphs and can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft to cartograph an area by automatically recording the GPS data. environmental planning, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo has been done, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digikam, users will want to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the image? first you should know that exi2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. the question is actually more, how the data can come into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the kipi module for geographic mapping (manual) and last over the manual input of known places.</seg>

<seg id="297">With the option of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, because PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value on a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF file option can compress the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the DEFLATE algorithm works less.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless free. even if you select the lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digikam, the editing image was just a picture viewer for photos. at present, it is very fast to manipulate your photos to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image slider.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard calibration is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the use of the second sensors has the effect that subsupplied images in four steps will get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-light, so the parts of your pictures are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lichter in the settings. the setting colors will produce some unusual results because it shows the top lights in various roses. lastly, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to reconstruct the option, you get the possibility to set a level. this is a value of three compromises and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the default 1. this can also be done in the picture options of the & digikam; - jQuery Slider window.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaq algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data generated by the color-filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and that is a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Colour reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. according to some tests, it looks like as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw, but it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color correction, as you will be carried out during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information like colour information from a colour space can be translated into the others so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>

<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative compared to xcalib or argyll. here are only your pictures of color not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not contain color tone mapping or gamma correction. currently dcraw Gamma corrected not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color tone.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print picture, since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what it is intended for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image gallery contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so they are not part of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top of the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the editing image will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saving or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should therefore possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with file saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore File menu, or use the button The Restore Restore Restore content in the toolbar. you lose any change you have done at the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the editing image can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Reverse or Restore Restore Restore Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should note the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you select the & LMB; you will find a moment longer through the return or restore button in the toolbar. if you select one of the menu items, all actions are also reversed and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image slider, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can view and zoom in the photo in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the Ansichts menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come into the normal view where you can use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change this in the settings dialog of & digikam; you can view it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting the jQuery Slider window.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print the picture in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print some images or entire sentences. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the Album Export Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without navigation keys, even in the jquery slider.</seg>
<seg id="354">Select the language in which this site should be shown</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. this means that all special characters are allowed. the lettering are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC-label field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After watching it, use either the button or simply switch to the next image, the lettering will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the Angle button there is a button More. with this, you can read other metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">This section review shows a evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the page bar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation will be written in the IPTC-field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords before in this & digikam; session ended stitch words.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search keyword. you can thus restrict the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have given different keywords, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate tick boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are saved in the IPTC-field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection if you want to add a selection of a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page header keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search views are used. if additionally one or more keywords can be used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and place them. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag them out of the right side panel and place them on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper case, the main window shows the images on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is restricted to no keywords, which reduces the amount of three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right click tree has been moved to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be switched between different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it would be one or not, you can easily change it with double-click on the text and in the rule range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced Search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. you can see the options as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">You can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted to & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-designed workflow is that the colors shown by your camera or scanner are a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a colour-designed workflow you can achieve that the colors appear on your monitor similar to your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish to them from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on colour management, everyone wants to know what buttons need to press for the results which he wants. unfortunately, colour management means that you can make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make informed choices so that you will receive the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor which is calibrated on the sRGB colour gamut. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are via email or web where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you then use a different colour gamut and have to worry about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual sample of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenic region, and colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensionale representation of sRGB with some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callify my monitor when I decided to work in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you work in sRGB colour space or not, you'll have to callify your monitor, since sRGB is out that your monitor is colored on sRGB calligraphy, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard calligraphy, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">Normalize the functions, equals, automatic balance and contrast from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction try to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminosity levels above the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its colour shading.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the light intensity of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the same very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonder at a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in between in between. this is only visible in pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is something limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can do far from the original image, areas with exposure exposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the shell mode, which works in 16 bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and preview of the target image will be adjusted. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram displays that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixel very small luminous values. with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve your photos or dimming the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Ant with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colours if more than a color channel of the Pixels is displayed.. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this will appear in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance which you have set can be saved in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button Preferences sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings can be displayed as your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires even more disk space, computing time and stands only for formats of PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assigning color profiles. color tone control can be done through the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use it for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner needs the same mistakes and you always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects will provide you with four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a canteen filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar arisation was also called Sabatier, an effect of a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completes the development of the image. the result was a partial negativity of the image. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase will ultimately create a negative image that is not to be generated on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel effect. the original image is the (1) and that process (2). the intensity of applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, he embodies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers highly saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The NeonFilter simulates neon light to the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the thickness of the neon light. in large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to modify the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can look at the different colour aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase them. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool tonal correction is based on the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you need to specify the area of the slide. more details the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three sliders are clicked in and that can be shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright sections.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and make sure that the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be set to determine whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logical classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the medium for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour petting can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the shadows, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to modify the output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used for example, to create a hidden image as background while something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically placed in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values stored in the file system can be saved and reloaded later. the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the history of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Surveillance Indicator option controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images with a digital camera, the linear mode of a constant color generates a wide beam. in this case, the logical mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are cornered with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos you can see a red marking. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that is the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pipettes automatically create the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Option Indicator option controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black white picture that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun tones were set with the colour pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digikam; jQuery is a tool to improve color channels or modify the color shading of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the Color Channel Mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint of how you can correct the channels by watching the relative distribution and impact. the left section of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appears to indicate the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: control for red, green and construction enable you to mix these channels. if you are able to activate Luminance the image will keep the overall brightness even if you use the option Monochrome, as the channel blender then is the creation of great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible noise is caused by the color channel. colour breads consist of small noise artifacts that are not at the same place in the colour channel and whose noise patterns are different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the color first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any Mixer setting can save you later and then load them. the file format used is the Gimp channel blender format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Surveillance Indicator option controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since colour images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film lighting with a green lens filter. this looks good for all sceneries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filters: simulates a black / white filming with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film lighting with a red line filter. this creates dramatic sky-effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of time. so similar to the 003 cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film lighting with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit cold into the shadow tones. this is very similar to the process of preparing a pressure and re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digikam tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the stich of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture is applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam, tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is no easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your picture. throughout the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), rounded around it with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any place. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from colour space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will need to be the character set size of the image size.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digikam device template you can place a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The picture template can be used in the image gallery can be used to place templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation. however, you have to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you must set your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog box. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for templates, a tree view, which reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder automatically updates the preview toolbar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button shredders the below picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must rotate the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template below. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy to produce, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unity mask works on the contrast of edges around a picture sharpening. in fact, it is not a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it's a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokshaving is possibly the best of the three as it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adapting.</seg>
<seg id="483">The same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are turning a focus screen already during reading the image. if you disable this, you get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can obtain usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to focus sharpening with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should be careful not to handle the results very naturally: sharpening increases sharpness of edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refill the tool. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to make the picture a bit soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for the softener with the menu entry Corrigate softeners and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masquerade is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or the amount increases the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radio shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radius. therefore, you should sharpen images at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount determines the percentage between the original and the wisely picture one which is added to the original. thus, the thickness of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swellvalue is a break out of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for a channel of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces, skating and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masculine was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; refocusate tool refuses an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unfolding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a sharpness mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular circuit works much better than the palate's folding. the palate's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical outcome even from the source pixies that are far from the original source. the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced by most cases even very strongly from the removed pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular edge sharpness: this is the radius of the circular circuit. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most of the images the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very sharp should then pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter if your Unity Gauß is. this is most often caused by a previously executed Unity Filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value nonzero otherwise you must also increase the correlation and / oderden noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix codes: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you select big values for the circular edge or the palate. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any refuted parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, unsharp mask produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp mask of a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp mask has to create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be removed the effect of the sharpness. the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least just as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for field correction in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The controller Smooth sets the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to not remove the artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail view p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction Dependability Alpha [0,100]: a small value is smooth in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this is the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is common because it is then difficult to create the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-step distance da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the More on quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. therefore we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. each setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie storage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or moiredestal; effects of inscribed images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subdirectory details and the subwindow Advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the pixel spacing. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to determine fluorescent changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the whole noise can be removed or spikes can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details Settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details Settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically tend to be roughened.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase cycle absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phasenjitter appear on the edges. it can remove smokes and phasenjitter on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be saved in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to sharpen the picture is a bit soft, fortunately a lot easier than a picture. use this tool for the softener with the menu entry Corrigate softeners and experiment with the deposit. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adjusted to remove any noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local faults that occur in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss of compression algorithm it creates some compression & quot; Artefactether; - small standards that are in uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera onto a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. the original image is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures have been reduced to an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the Scan artefacts that have been created with a scanner. the original image is shown below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixels allows you to remove the hot pixels of photos with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem with high-quality raw mode photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to capture the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark image to the correcting image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard is automatically reviewing the final dark image and reloads this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and preview help you to correct the results within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all predictive areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filter available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 by pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a colour photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; vignetting correction is a tool for correcting the vignetting, i.e. underlined corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially in medium and large photo formats, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. teleobjtive shows also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary closure time under circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise impaired effects can occur through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure ranges from present-day film and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter by using an equivalent transformation in a raw image that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignette correction is the transformation with a centerFilter. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vignetting accuracy filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates with an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, correspondingly lower the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignation, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers present only positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to adjust the brightness of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; you can drag the images from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct picture. a lamp and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second graft deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third graft has a similar circuit effect, flax but on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grader corrects the remote corners opposite to the second grader. if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion of second graft. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion of fourth digits. this value is stronger to the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the reversed character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient. negative values increase while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used for the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. in case you have to cut a picture and then perform a tone-shaped correction, the effect is apparent in the groove.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction you will find this tool a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can cut them with the cutting tool in the menu transforms from the image slider or the zoom controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most of the pictures the tone-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives like shots from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective to correct the angle in the image of 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tone-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film by the Gimphoo.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the optional Füge Filmstrip if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter is mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filtering sensor applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed filming like e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri-X.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, graceful sight especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is although often higher values are needed, ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the processed film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; Filter Oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suitable for large pictures.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel sized image is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a charcoal sketch. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 in order to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (embossing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon draw filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter Gravur conceals your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; Filter Gravur is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure that is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work piece by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Unity effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: blurred the image along three-shaped lines that emanate from one focal point. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often used in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unity: blurred the image by rotation of the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removing unsharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image by horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">This creates photos with a dreamy and shining soft focal effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Protect the image by accidental displacement of the pixels and thereby simulates the sharpness of a random moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart Unity: find the colour pool in the picture and wipe them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The ramp drops are a nice small tool to make raindrops onto your image. it gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn urheberlegally protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drip. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small pictures. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; you can drag a area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start to start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drop filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it to the right orientation by mirroring or rotating.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture of smaller is simple. the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image when the boundaries of resolution are reached? how can you restore the missing information again or guess? the Cimg algorithm that is used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep the aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the input of the new size will remain the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is set, since it is then difficult to create the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and Download are used exactly. every single photo can be saved as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small coloured image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The editing of a photo is not only a commonly performed operation, but also a frequently underrated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo, you just have to use the mouse only the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply drag the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The trimming button of the image slider in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file save or save file from the File menu to save the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After the aspect ratio, you can provide orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the higher value of the height and the width of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After the aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically switch horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set up the range for cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After the aspect ratio calculates its settings dependent on the orientation (horizontal or vertically). if you are using the cutting tool for the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the composition help make it possible to help you create your images better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic elements are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-bass, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide the rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles to the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks that constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid auxiliary lines when you assemble a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you to your destination good results for your photos. compared to third-hand gel, the golden spiral generates a liquid line which the eye can follow through the image. this type of composition leads to the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The gold triangles are also derived from the top discussed golden spiral. the points of the gold rectangles are the middle points of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, gold triangles are not a angular triangles. diagonal of these lines can be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use gold triangles to break your frame you create an effect of professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try to place your picture focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirroring can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can set the color of the helper lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way, you can customize the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things around an angle are rotated. you can repair this with the & digikam; or repair the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the button Preferences, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free rotation module provides horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after having moved it over an important point of the image, you can adjust it to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is the function transformieren slicing from the image slider.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the feature Automatic assignment. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option controls the image a bit after the rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a little dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small but two adaptations create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unwanted triangular holes at the corners. a way to clean this is the picture with transforming cutting out of the image slider.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can switch horizontally and vertically. if you press on default settings, the angle will appear to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image will appear to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, vertical and horizontal line finishes. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button around the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scoring, the image will wipe a bit. for a single shot, this effect is usually negligible, but two chats generate twice as much wireling and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shooting, the picture has unadorned triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the picture with transforming cutting out of the image slider.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the type such as these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to process a large number of picture formats with & digikam;</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select the format you want to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images. in this way, redundant information will be reduced to save image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000er version can also store lossless if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can read raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter of & digikam; you can find further information on the use of modules with & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="809">The kipi module for geographical localization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit the meta data in the metadata of an image and the geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The kipi module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsone can download and convert data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Figure Geographic Localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file contains data that have been recorded at the same time in the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation carried out the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera can be changed by GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera eit. if the deviation below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolishing and Difference in minutes can be used if you have no appropriate data. if you know that in reality there is a locating in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits and then press the button correlate to the interpolation.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog gets the coordinates of a call to the next note, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location may also be found and set by the displayed map. select the respective region and increase sie.Add this again through until you have reached a reaching accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed manually between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the kipi module there are ways to mount the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that the Exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The kipi module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to allow the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">This module has four tabs that can be adapted to the settings. the tab allows it to select all albums to be exported to HTML. the albums are not hierarchically displayed. with the three buttons on the right side, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, you can quickly see a large number of albums. in the area below you will see the Albenvorschau and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab of the tab defines the overall appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will appear in the image. otherwise the image will appear directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. it naturally also affects the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">You can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press down to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module is created, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occur during the creation. the web browser will automatically start to view the preview of the gallery. press the module to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The kipi picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL supported tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The kipi picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as rotations, zoom, or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and manoeuvres. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The kipi JPEG Lossless Module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to store images in JPEG format, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases, because no compression of the color information is taking place.</seg>
<seg id="837">The kipi module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The kipi module digital camera client does not have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the Mailingliste des kipi teams at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The kipi module Metadata editor has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org des kipi-teams.</seg>
<seg id="840">The import function of the metadata module allows you to copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then select the import function.</seg>
<seg id="841">This feature does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any destination format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check out exi2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The kipi MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the Diaschau. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. for burning the medium you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that indicate an image. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and path of the generated file can be set under name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can start drinking a coffee and enjoy the diaschau when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer enables you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: make sense to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this kipi module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a originality of Him is: expect dcraw to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file that should be converted and run the module. the Raw-Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that are contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion with the output button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use them.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack processing mode allows you to convert different pictures at once. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single pictures. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file. this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to modify the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your picture to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportionate: not proportional size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the resolution and size of the photo box. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this kipi module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you selected. you can add more images via the button to add images. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list and drag them to the list of the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove images from the list of images to be sent from the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all images, you can open the New Message window of your E-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you selected are already attached as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't forget to send many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and each time you use it again.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must install the GMail Agent on your computer before downloading. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, comments will be added to the pictures in a text file and put the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best suited for lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to sendmail.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can view the status messages, looking for errors. however, your e-mail program will start automatically at the end. by closing this window you can close this window?</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window will appear with questions as you want to see your diaschau. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the Diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file names indicate that the filename of the pictures will appear in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a final loop. you can then manually with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the pictures will be displayed in a random order. so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images, the temporal distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions effects between you can select. randomly selects a different effect between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can hold the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower screen edge you can see the current filename, the location of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The kipi module time & date does not have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the Mailingliste des kipi teams at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The kipi module background image is a tool for setting an image as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE working surface area.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your images and videos with annotations, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, you are now in any group, so in persons, places and in group keywords entries are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have given information when you have provided your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images displayed on which both persons are visible. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view photos in order to view the images of your scope.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can save with & kphotoalbum, but for every person you can save your own preview image, which also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the name, select the button, which is on the right outside on the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display a list of keywords with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to specify the image for each individual person. to do this, you need to view the picture-Ansichts window (described in detail) and select the category editor. in the Ansichts window you can customize the picture for the appropriate person. in the Ansichts window you can customize the picture for the appropriate person. in the Ansichts window you can customize the picture for the appropriate person.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you visit the window in the main window, you will see a dialog that is similar to the dialog for setting the image properties very similar. this dialog allows you to view the image once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the field description or description, the descriptions and descriptions of the pictures are searched after this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here you will find pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather try to try out the following options, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the fast-entry, the screen pictures and entry videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; then some example images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name says, this bar shows you date of date about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar indicates another unit. you can switch between units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar allows you to interact with the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, you will see the first image of this date in preview) and in addition, the time bar always shows the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button and the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time information. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">You can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code).</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas of content, layout and destination.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file will be created on the overview page. if you want to see the export files you'll find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages, so you can avoid that information will be displayed without description. for example, that all images are taken from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; at the moment all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus those who support your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have specified. so you can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if he would like to get an image bigger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible for viewers. if you have created a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages were created, you should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them manually. so the import function, see, properly works you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described settings are related to all three basic folders and URLs. in this way, a subfolder is created, whose name you set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. if you have already spent a lot of time for the images, recording place, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ from the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and this file can be passed on as independent. the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting pictures you can view from the File External Menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the option to copy Manuell to the .kim file you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. as most of the pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you would like this, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximum image size limit. if you send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture is at most 800 pixel high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import File menu, & kphotoalbum; importing the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import is made up of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the importing file (if you are a domain) while this category is called for your database. therefore, you'll be asked in the third dialog box, which categories of the imported file will be imported and which categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can adjust the categories of the importing file with the categories of your present database. for example, you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view photos: if you look at pictures, you might often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on this, you might want to see all the pictures that this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the various steps from (1) to specify the information about your images, about (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. but it was expanded and today it is also taking care of your videos. at many places in this manual it will be talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all his information in the index.xml file in the uppermost folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale Backup Tools, copy on a disk or revisions in the CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">You can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code).</seg>
<seg id="951">In the following section of the User Manual, the different settings will be explained in the following section of the User Manual.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you will see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can specify different properties for each image, for example, persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for any existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete list of member groups, i.e. all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the window, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digibar and Gwenview. this module system is called kipi and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the Module. the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules yourself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over kipi are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use kipi is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this type of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">The picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you want to use the category people, then & kphotoalbum; so, so if you would have chosen people to view the module and pass this to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and select the module which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen as soon as you can start & kphotoalbum; with your own images.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the above menu and a toolbar. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you have not added any information about your images. in this section we will see the window that will show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each picture with notes, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can place each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section, if you want to see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the moving of the pictures within the list: if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 images, the same 5-10 people can be depicted, so that the names are moved upwards to find people faster and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click the icon for sorting after date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have any comments for each image individually, you might want to edit all the images and add these images with annotations. just click on the front and back buttons, which are below the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">"" "Marcia Cross in" "" "Quantico" "" "(Spoiler) 06.11.2015 | Vampire Diaries" ""</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window which shows the USA as a surround. to show you that it is a group, a special icon will appear.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the annotation dialog is possible to add an entry to an existing or new overlay or sub-category. in addition, you can also draw one entry into one category and place it in order to make it a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking on and move the cords that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and click on the window below. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or all images you have no filter set. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of preview images, by simple downward pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button, just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be created as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this image viewer will appear in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press the Remove button or select Edit Select from the Edit menu. now the window will appear that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; you can use the images somewhere, so you can record the pictures somewhere, so & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. this is for example with the pictures 1-9. for the pictures 5-9, however, the preview images are present, so & kphotoalbum. you can view the preview of these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and back into it again. if you want to avoid annoying your images, please download a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, you filter the images so that at the end of those who want to see others inaccessible and click on the latest view. alternatively, you can also use all the images that your little sister can see, fire and lock the menu entry all except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set the pictures in the case of the case. if you give your laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry, so that all the pictures you want to have blocked. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered for unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select a password in the menu of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this image protection is not very secure. you can find all the images on the hard disk and another one can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to amend the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you all manage your pictures with & kphotoalbum; of course, you can spend hours of hours with them, of course, that you want to look at it sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; you can start it from the preview as described in detail.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he naturally shows the picture, but additional information you have about the image, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can easily drag them with the mouse and locate somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see, suitable entries to this page. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all images of Anne Helene. as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can change between them and go back by using the buttons picture up and down. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as a slide. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or Minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it's possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>

<seg id="1001">With the dot button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the parity key, the zoom uses the zoom, so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out-out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can add comments to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you view images, it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. in the moment you can open the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures, and mark them as well or poorly, while you look one after another.</seg>

<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because each pixel is continuously split up and adaptively because each pixel is continuously split and adaptively because the recursive depth of the calculated colour values depends on.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between color values to the neighboring pixels is dealt with the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels using super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel, which can be monitored individually and checked for further submission. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you switch to Jittering, changing & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for this.</seg>

<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the object-start of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High level of detail for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided, if the camera is using an extended projection. expanded projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this feature creates a better approach for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is shown in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the ground, a bottom is rendered below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When tightening edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window instructions, you will be explained how to create and store window directions.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the button add and remove a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the chosen window ordering. new views can you create with the button Add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unts anchor the window under the existing window, with map card, you will get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to begin without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene under beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you will only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering will be used as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't want to insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything in error free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1085">This is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the properties properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera sees control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. simply click on a control point and pull it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button or press the Enter button, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you might want to insert a quader (insert final body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a complete method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the button or button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now shows the level, even at the moment only as a limited final level. if you renew the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">In this case, you will find the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will only see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find the different options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, changing the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but you can choose something slightly at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select the object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can see the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with one click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment shows only a matte black material because you can check the color of materials at any time with a click on preview. now give the color for the pigment.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you see no color on quader and ball in the preview, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now properly adjusted. if you renew your picture with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you need to specify two new attributes. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called one colored. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more often, but the chessboard color list can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose any single colour in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to do so, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; already understood. the ball is just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget the input button or button to press) so that the ball is swinging above the floor, because you have shifted the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. use a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to you now. as already at the bottom, give the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose First Objects and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click the Pigment Ball, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the next screen pictures and click on or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection are already partially good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if Metallisch: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; and hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you find a scene raytracing, the rendering of the hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which renders the scenes) through every pixel in the scene. the vector calculates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source, you see nothing, the image is just black. obviously every scene you want to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files typically have the file extensions * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already have saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last modified command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used the reverse.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwriting an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the look, button shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcut. you can change the short command for & kpovmodeler; modify commands or add new commands with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set the tool bar. you can add and remove the tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to forward rough surfaces without modifying any diffraction on the surface without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic structures are simple geometric shapes that you can use as blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to indicate the surface of an object color to pixel base, by applying a image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the & LMBn; or the Return button.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images are always to use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialogue - & kuickshow; there are five cards. in three of them, General and editing and slide show, you can set the operation mode of & kuickshow; in the two others, shortcut for the display window and shortcut for the browser, the shortcuts can be specified for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color, which you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, invites & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">This option saves & kuickshow; when closing the name of the last opened folder. the next start opens and kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window mode is larger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; set up so that only some of the file types are displayed, which can represent the program.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & amarok; requires some of them to find modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD precedes that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & amarok; is something more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & amarok are compiled with the same compiler. if e.g. & amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.x, this leads to crash when editing the Meta information.</seg>

<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace email (the e-mail will automatically open when crash). if it is a common crash, and send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in meta information, but they do not identify as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and achieve simultaneous audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the problem and help. for GStreamer you may need to specify another sink (e.g. shock sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That's & amarok; already. don't forget that media will need to be encoded at first. you can only listen to ALSA but you would only hear a white noise. gstreamer is the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. gstreamer reads the file, decoded it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. gstreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. enable SoundServer with the highest possible priority (real time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.X there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed play. read this bug report. the enlarging of the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either use not the Arts driver but instead of GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.dat & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been heavily optimized for Analyzer), or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display that shows the current current piece or current stream. one click on this area changes the display of the already expired game time to still remaining playing time.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>

<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser design. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. this three subwindows will later be used in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok; you may wonder that the subwindow will drop off. the information presented there are now in other parts of & amarok; moreover, the information can be collected in the statistical window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow shows information on the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to hit the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz icon you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">In order to view covers images in the context browser, the cover images are in the same folder as the current piece. the images may have any names, but images with the word front in the name will be preferred. the context browser will show covers images, which are either downloaded by the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>

<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically detect your collection once you have something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the supervision. hints for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter is a selection field, with its help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year. in addition, you can also select your entire collection so that the filter is practically turned off.</seg>

<seg id="1379">The playlist browser designed to handle many playlists very easy. among other things, he also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent playlists. they use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even self-created intelligent playlists are possible. click on Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new intelligent playlist. there you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player sub-window is used for connecting & amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpret sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired title from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this way, the tracks will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transmission is completed, finish & berok; and dissolve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you can find a search area where you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is a address bar with which you can pick music from a entered URL. if you are for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachments of files may be difficult. in this case the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: this will be added automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all of you to play attached pieces. you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop. above the playlist you will only see the pieces that contain the letters. in order to reset the filter, press the button until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you are searching for separate search terms, search & berok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter a two three search terms, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found which contain one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain whitespace, then close the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this is why Mike Oldfield included, but not by entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you provide a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, make a minus sign in front of the search term: - something searches for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants to another. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or contain a higher rating than 50 and not the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key pressed and then clicking the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of playlist. on the left side you will find the Add to add the playlist to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next follow the buttons Return and Restore. this allows you to undo or recover changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here you can set up general program settings. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is like many other & kde; applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionality range, therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the accompanying programs you have.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line utility dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you must ensure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; programs have common, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD, and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void IntelligentProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project on the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void addUrl (QString Sets) void addUrl (QString path) void addUrl (QString path) void addUrl (QString path, QString path, QString newname) void setFilterIterator (QString path, QString newname) void setFilterIterator (QString path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">In this way, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createfolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reading for & kde; with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and of many encoders who code this WAV file (compression).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you must have lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Kodierer. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something itself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which codebook / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device is protected, it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of coping protection. avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you frequently stumbled at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which coders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' Shorten 'or' Pit ', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>

<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrate rates), but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrate rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG reproduction devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and something less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR compression rate around 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a Titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate around 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a Titels. good recovery for music of young people, portable devices and car registers. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely have the absolute highest quality without regard to the size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / used / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the codecs explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (english: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch-tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button description in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself in the computer. it is to be noted that this is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not supposed to be legal, but I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be infringed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than those in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used by the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geogram should be used to use freedb. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually generated monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my host?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see Note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the generated WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. during the first open are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGs) and FLAC (loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the code. other Kodiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the coders can be used. more information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers more information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the case of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter by step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual read everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to produce MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example using a search engine, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can naturally do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permission (eg; by using the Konqueror something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is presumably done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD;, which needs to be repeated for each outing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the coding of the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will not change it at any time reading a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device recording is transferred to the reading program that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device of your disk. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map General settings. here you can't do much. here you can find an additional conversion. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">If you have any queries, please contact us on Tel.: + 49 5764 318 444. or contact us per email.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the & CD, so that he can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, will immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with a low risk when you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag records, can be easily changed. the directory or file name is changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter anything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, this is worth more than 620 MB. however, these two choices must be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equal to the server, as many firewalls do the protocol 8880 standard, there is maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to transmit data to the freedb server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take over the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your host)</seg>
<seg id="1565">At the same time: excuse, there is one reason why more than one drive? parallel reading and coding? the author knows it not, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folders for temporary files: if you cross this, then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances it is necessary to filter something to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restriction of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you don't need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This topic describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each outing & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in freedb, see the screenshot in a bit different than that for one & CD; with success of freedb retrieved data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of getting them from the Internet. comments are indicated on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD only needs to be pushed into the drive which has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successful by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; a window will appear and you can select the database entry that will suit your opinion the best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually release it manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but pick up the data from the Internet, you need the link to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Aktueller Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered into the input field 'Aktueller Title' unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for each comments of inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it contains already the data as shown in the following screen photo. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with uppercase letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited length of field, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the Kodierersatz tab; you have a look at the 'GrundSettings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later using tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and file formats. see the Help button to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry that obviously matches the style of the lenght CD; in this example, this is not important because we don't transfer the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. just click on the line automatically switches the selection of the piece one or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the button all the pieces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection of the reading process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab to switch on the job window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for checking the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a Kodierer you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder is not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the start of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in case of high-performance machines, the result is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. and 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you will need the lower of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1657">Each section may appear once, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired.</seg>
<seg id="1658">IPTC: caption Social Destorsion live at the Greenfield Festival in Interlaken (Switzerland) on June 13th 2009. IPTC: copyright Notice Copyright by Shelley Jambresic.</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that DEFINE is needed to show that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can be available in future versions of & kmid; support can provide devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patch of General MIDI to be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the parody is ignored. it is assumed that the GM options are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to lay on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support an admirer (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (shotgun), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum-Patch of the patch is meant to be a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one with the sound the pitch of the same drum means (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is needed to indicate how sounds are depicted on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as their presence. you must therefore create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the percussion channel. see for example the keymaps included.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, simply make sure that the CHANNELOS section is easy.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will be used to use the name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion grenade patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is to be multiplied in what ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-end event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM prefers that a keyboard that is a pitch-end event will be played with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play a tone up to one octave higher. in order to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are played exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not illuminate more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played sounds. the view in the Settings menu under the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can result in very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file requires about 50 KB, while an mp3-file 4 MB needs (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the different instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a bins (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagree to support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">If you do not necessarily enable automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; desktop an & konqueror; - Windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or want to play a file, simply switch to & konqueror; window and move the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding them to a collection, turn off automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. opening of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so make the setting of automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.C. and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, you animate me on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I am studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have lots of time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You make me really a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and I don't want anyone to get it for it. I want to emphasize that I just want to program, because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AWE board.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it will run as if you would have a sound card, except that you can't hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files that supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional assistance please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; users Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window which will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark feature, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Daughter playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an extra hierarchy level. if you get an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and start playing with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current unit ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, choose the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 above option to '1. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable other animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation when starting boot doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing during the end animation, but the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying your favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; img dur = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" /</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of Mplayers in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code).</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playlist in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything has to be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, as the setting of the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even be played the special field video for YouTube in playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To make the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & KMPlayer; is used in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding loading the Browser module library. if there is no error, the backend output within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">For example, this should be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phononon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the scanner needs to be used and the TV channels need to be used, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (Video Data Rekorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog box is in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be ports to be detected (e.g. PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux). this is also only possible on the first screen (: 0.0). for the XFree86 server it needs to be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internal are used by KMPlayer for sources of different names. at the time of the origin of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, source source, source source, source source, vcdsource and vdsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hints how I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play off from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is used as a user root after loading the device. it is absolutely sure to make sure that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slow down, why must every time be tested on their performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhaut. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email items are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves as a clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of the team members who he is. this is done by searching the team member from the list and the button is pressed as pressed. the currently selected member (your identifier) appears in bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important regarding messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leader if something is happening. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that will be executed when something is happening in the project. an example would be the record of opening and closing the project, so that later you can see how much someone worked, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that is added to the CVS as soon as they are added to the project & etc;</seg>

<seg id="1943">Annotation is simple. either the note entry can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary area followed by annotation.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname of the specified nickname of the team member is to be given in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Head of Subproject leaders.</seg>

<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the bug has been completely re-developed. the support for the non-needed built & PHP; (3) debugger is set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plugin is implemented, which allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button options next to the debugger plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points, with row numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view where the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action will be connected to debugger, if required, or it shares the plug-in to listen to decode requirements. this action is triggered by default if a project is opened using a debugger so that normally does not need to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the sounds according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the view debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Assign the debugger to start the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Assign the debugger to start with the execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbols-oriented bars of image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions quicker into a document when a user could ever be.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to create, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">Tag XML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialogs, den & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick paste of tags to a document without a danger of typing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing as a folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders contribute the name of the description language and version, so existing. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of tag XML and declared whether it is necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only be found in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains only element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of the tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the class class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type property. gives the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to any other tag. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. in addition, it contains more tags that describe how this attribute is to be shown & etc; This is an element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; & & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog at the top of the & quantaplus; window will start and select TagXMl.. another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, check only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor to be reachable via DTD Bearer DTD settings. in this way diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Transitional / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... Click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned to this action assigned key shortcuts. clicking the User defined button can be assigned a button shortcut; with Kein the current button shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can enter a text in the Detailiete settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use the document (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start -dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. this way attempts & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we'll be replaced with the URL of the current document. in the event of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is attached to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script can take input from & quantaplus; in the input field input, the default input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be changed. there are two types of issue: normal output, which is written on standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified, which is set to the standard output by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. pressing the new action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the tag attributes and you are planning their use, enable dialogue "Tag" when available to allow input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, graphic Other programs (or where otherwise it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, we need 22x22. to change this, select the others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view of that the day starts, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signalized, or if you want to insert a message to the user, to insert a message to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating symbols, it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Angle button and continue with other tags, so there are still which, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus; functions for the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar dialog via Settings tool bars. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by proofing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After NeueXML does not exist, it will create a root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (if a file is opened from the appropriate type).</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most mentioned enhancement of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; checking whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060">For troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code).</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of the documentation in documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Academic Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess shaft (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the construction supervision & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but be sure & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & & lt; in all & XML; based & quantaplus; Resourcfiles are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the section of the docrc file that is used for the context of context sensitive help. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily store your file docrc and save $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (how to specify it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. documentation used to the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud of having collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else who are sent. at different places there is an E-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correctly and usable for publication.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading your passphrase you will be asked for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the case you have multiple keys, you can leave a search. in the New Resource dialog, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload the toolbar toolbar, and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installing, study & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and marking. in case of problems, it may be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed, a message appears with the name of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in dayXML format. there is the easiest way to automatically convert DTD automatically into a DTEP packet.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Transitional HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Frameset HTML 4.01 Strict HTML 4.01 Transitional HTML 4.01 Frameset HTML 4.01 + RDFa 1.1 HTML 3.2 HTML 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand this and to understand full benefit from & quantaplus; therefore, one must first be familiar with these fundamental concepts, without understanding & quantaplus; little usefulness.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area divided into three areas: global, locally and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; all that is selected as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development products for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to tool bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the construction managers, the maps with information and tool bars. please note, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all kinds of cards, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-clicking in the editor area will lead to a further contextual menu concerning the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the file under the mouse pointer or opening the file if the string is named under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window there are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is transitioned as standard for which a set of tool bars are shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; PGT; in their document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert the data for this just added tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction managers (QIT;) enable to navigate to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and browse them. in the presentation with map tags, for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as adding, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage media can be executed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category is dependent on & quantaplus; global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Lokal and Project works here. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by links clicking a element, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right clicking a element, a list of commands opens up a list of commands related to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears below the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the application-oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create own documentation, and by adding a folder to a project, project specific documentation can be edited, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cards at the bottom end of the window, can be reached using the useful information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This card reader shows information about each in Quanta running script. such as the DTD of the current document and all modifications to DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This card reader shows all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can backup them in & quantaplus; just like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; for this, autoconf has a number of options to be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH is in front of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus started to deal with a nearby idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible Markup Language editor would be? well, this would make it the most amazing Web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; it should be & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE;.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why developing what has already been developed? thanks to the & kde; -smst is not only possible, but allows users and developers to expand and quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-knitting actions, scripts and tool bars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way related to commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details of the documentation, help: / quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently being developed and looked after Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A fast access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard, it contains special characters to & HTML, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; statement which is the correct way to paste special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used for inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & shift key; key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP scripts are error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Training and intimidation of the problem reporter at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Search the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have further input / output modules (kio slave).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; projects can be found for details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of the tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this will only create the name. actions must be saved using Settings actions... or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. it doesn't delete it from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the upload of tool bars to the main server, where each other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Invite & DTD; that you or anyone has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh of entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be resolved without renew the entire & DTEP; if this is global and not present in the global KDE file, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disables the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins listed below are listed below the menu items listed above. click on. clicking on a plugin is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line end ID. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document by using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may need time or unfair graphics. recommended by the map mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog include any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behaviour of the editor. in the documentation of & kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or add what can be changed and the sequences can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in the best from top to bottom, as for example, after filling the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name the file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.example) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote computer setting, an adjustment should be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. several files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and want to change. in case of serversing scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated. if a project is re-started, not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of noodles.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks, or by removing the bunny, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can upload files in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or change the Shift; F7 button shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders are possible) to re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Added option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">For troubleshooting, feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at. make sure to include details on your browser, operating system, jQuery Slider version and a link (or relevant code).</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles you can upload high loads (see in), as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing out its own supervision for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see for details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, one can turn event actions and add or delete event actions, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously certain event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be affected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the Project or symbol project open from the toolbar. the Project Open dialog will appear and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; modified files will find. same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behavior, however, the entries open and open with... in the context menu with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will fall down to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high loads are created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slave. at least you should choose from & FTP,, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your sprue threshold, this is either a time saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easy, but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of the view, various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, which can be accessed or deleted by the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adapting & quantaplus; to their own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best over the toolbar toolbar. use and add addition to the toolbars. adding toolbars is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols can be adjusted either using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new tool bar can be created, and other actions like toolbars remove, rename tool bar or toolbars, which should be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbars are to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings tool bar... and setting actions.. Set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code-carving and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates as a simple file system with extended organisation and interfaces. you can copy, move or move any of the existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you can see for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary. binary templates are normally inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents in appropriate subfolders can be created.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see also for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for complete websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File Recovery as a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once it is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File Save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, select the option with drag and drop to the supervised template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied into one template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project file tree view to a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the template. by default it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can prefix headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; create, paste files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders represents one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click the folder and select Properties tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is terminated as soon as Elder attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except the main folders in the template Overview. if a root folder would be set in such a way, the blah would appear in this path, unless they were explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear as a text-tree. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows pre-created or recreated text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying content templates into a folder containing special headers / footers a whole presentation already with the right headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders, or copy and paste from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reachable through the menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second partition the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back to source code in which the changes in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green icon shows the presence of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first one, except that the changes are visible in the source text editor and the VPL; editor in sync. with pressing F9 this mode is activated, this mode is active, pressing the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small chip for fast machines and a large chip for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website so that the editing of invisible tags in work with the VPL; editor is also possible. the document properties dialog will also be called once a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this means that you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information on the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click in the list allows change of the content, e.g. keywords at the column name and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to create pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change over the list is just like with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules are currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is like in a text processing, by moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is behaved as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags have already inserted an existing tags, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed from any other surrounding Anker tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table assistant or the list assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; later in this release, the tables or lists tool bars are used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xslotg; is a tool for checking style templates. unlike other programs for style templates, search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be traced.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xslotg; successfully compile, except & kde; still the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already existing at a typical installation of & kde; already existing.</seg>
<seg id="2229">New in xslotg 3.1.4: in the gdb compatibility mode, the most vulnerable can be set in a certain file and line number and will later be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xslotg returns the full path from a filename without path. filenames in the same folder as the uppermost loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder with xsl.xsl, is possible to enter the following input:</seg>
<seg id="2231">This command is checked for partial or complete alignment with a preage called QNAME or a given model name. & eg; template right with each QNAME, which contains the string template.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Each namespace in the given "QNAME" will be extended according to the rules defined by the namespace of the XSL source file: test1 will be added & eg; extended to http: / / www.w3.org / 199 / XSL / Transform: test1</seg>
<seg id="2233">A questionable holding point must be dissolved for the associated URI and line number. this will be performed automatically when loading the first template by xslotg. stops are restructured shortly after the start of each run.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why & kdiff3; let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes, and at the same time corrected many changes at the same time. another programmer had a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within that line. and there were no hints at the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, many other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare the text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders. this feature turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-sized file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; when selecting the correct changes. in this editor, you can even edit the results directly. the screen shot shows three source files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you when comparing and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; when folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and distract the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no annoyance anymore if you change the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but in different folders, then you can complete the tipparbeit by typing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">1 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows to manually enter file names, the selection of the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, you can use a folder, for B and C, but a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to specify a output file at once. you can also get this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text items from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two appropriate files in & kdiff3; download and compare them. now you can easily copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you are not able to extract anything from & kdiff3; only drop down text in a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and editing text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The upper part of each text window is the info line. the information line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional).</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, you can see the color that distinguishes it. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g. are white characters only in strings and comments, for preprocessor and in few rare instances.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line will be dotted around broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) also has an info line with the wording edition:, the filename and [modified] if you have worked the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find the most solved / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. this group will then be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and a black bars appear on the left.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes through automatic merging or manually editing, no further row is left in the group; then in these lines of text & lt; no line in the source is displayed; this is only a placeholder for the event that you may change your opinion and maybe another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may copy and paste it elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; clash of clashes; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the Options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click on one of the window, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, side down, start, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-end, as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other keys for editing. using the Insert button you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the section and the editing window has been declared).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-unten / Ctrl-top), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-unten / Ctrl-Up) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, you will automatically copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, you will automatically copy the clipboard and remove the manual copy. be careful, because you might accidentally overwrite the contents of clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newsletters are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix variants are using a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenreverse + line feed\\ r\. Kdiff3 keeps the filing of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved and restored when the next start is restored. (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to select, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in a funny script. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be displayed. at these systems the button Preferences automatically adjusts an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, pressing the tabulator key will inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or return, the return of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to clipboard. manually copy the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally common selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are ignored. white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, but then files with different sizes in the page-to-page comparatively look identical although they are different. if this option is enabled, you will be deactivated. if this option is enabled, this option will be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are shown, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is activated in default setting. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic restling mode, this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (pre-set is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the functions Wähle A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and executing a merging. check for details below documentation to the directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjusts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to finish & kdiff3; exit and restart to change the change. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for coding appears a brief hint that is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has a pure informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16 bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">(note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the Options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a color coded oversight column will appear. but sometimes you may just want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -GT; C or B & lt; -GT; C or B & lt; -GT; C will appear next to the normal or a second supersichts column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply make the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files. a simple click starts the compilation and uses the file name of the last source file as preset names for output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command will only be used when entering the line. you can write your own preprocessor which matches exactly your requirements. each input line needs to have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the Diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases it is sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessor to convert the input into upper case letters: sed 's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution).</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignorance of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing order for newsletters. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit will be replaced by nothing but virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several things at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the translations from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">You can also use perl -p -e's / REGEXP / substitution / SCHALTER 'allergen are in perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the default'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and merging. the other operations only change the data that the Zeilenabgleich-Algorythmus looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line abbreviation preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders are recursively compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without actually doing it.</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selects selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparison and merging of individual files very similar. you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder is specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message box on current progress. if you want to scan the folder, only the files are listed, which have been compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object, or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions View all subdirectories and fold all sub directories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the interaction design will not be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when you are not identical. then you also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option is synchronized. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge together and save the result in both folders. (the user sees the visible file name for output file only B; directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged together and select the newer file instead of merging (uncertain), then check & kdiff3; the date of files and proposes the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. if such errors are not fixed, the merge directory cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file will be executed after the other. the status column demonstrates how it was successful, and according to other messages, if something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is fine everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">This includes the number of unsolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolving conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you do not have a target folder, it will be used as a destination in the three folder combination mode C as a destination, using the two folder merge B as destination and used for synchronizing A and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (button shortcuts). to merge only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid combination actions, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with the options Extending, Simulating and Breaking.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate when you want to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merging window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready with a file, select reboot / continue, or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When & kdiff3; on a bug, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem. if you want to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue to merge with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually compiled, you see & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and executes them in later execution of all entries. even if the merger has been skipped or not stored, these entries will be merged again. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are shown in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the pattern with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder specifically can be set with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">This option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: when the option is turned off, the links like normal folders will be treated and rekursiv. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible records. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible records.) This option is turned off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Provides complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-sample.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders on a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the changeling date and file size. however, this speed benefit cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to trusting the changeling date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful for instance when copying the changeling date. please use caution. this option is reset in default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates syncing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results from the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is turned off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, it will be proposed instead of merging the copying of the newer file as action. (this is assumed as uncertain, because it is assumed that the other file has not changed also. you should check this in any case.) This option is turned off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folders will be replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and receives the extension .orig. if an old backup file exists with the .orig. if an old backup file exists with the .orig. if an old backup file exists with the .orig. this option is turned on in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge file remains visible to the merge of single files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want, you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want, you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also use a single file directly without having to run the folder together. once you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with kio slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening files located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone. or.. contains. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be cashed. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is assumed as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the change date from the original. (note that this is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the differences spectator at KDevelop. ADBA first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, and kdiff3; then removes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; the patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it supports only the comparison of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">With the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now there are compars) there are already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the diff3 program from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I am using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by stating into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or go on it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably not specified the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure the configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; but if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is the same.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit large amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src was left; published and the text can't delete. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and lack the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should have no problems when compiling. if difficulties persist, please report on the & kde; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift _ remove) to clipboard and deletes the selected text. paste (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you must re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">If the target folder does not contain these files, it will be modified later. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is turned off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if the lines are already present), they will be removed accordingly when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting this option is disabled. differentials in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop, to change their size, change it or move them. this works both within a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktop and display applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">The middle mouse button can be moved within & kpager; movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicking on the empty backdrop of & kpager, the context menu has only the two entries pager. if you click on an application within & kpager, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimum, Maximize, On the Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window onto the full size of the desktop. only appears when you clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicking on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the name of the virtual desktop is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field, the & kpager; display the numbers of the virtual desktop. if it is enabled along with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, eg; 1st working area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & kpager; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; main window can be determined: classic leaves & kpager; in a 2xn grid, all virtual workspaces are known in a vertical and vertical line, which is very good for the presentation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control panel. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display and move the window as symbols or with their content. moreover, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button inside & kpager; and then select Shift switches... let the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in dialog settings. however, you can manually perform this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you need to login as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application which constantly extends to new functions. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">The main window of & kmag; shows the magnified area of the screen. the picture shown in the magnification window is a magnified area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting increases & kmay; the area around the mouse cursor as a movable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can create a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse button at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that & kite; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can insert and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & shift key, press the & MMB; you can move the selection box.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer understands a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome, and which every mouse click pains ache.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that comes in clicking the mouse, and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, due to the naked moving of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clarify it once again: even though & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid pain caused by moving the mouse is useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can fall for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and carries a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, make & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before leaving the mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be cited after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; click the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent sliding is switched on, the shooting field is active (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button again, the mouse button is left again when the mouse button is left again when no moving the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; supports clicking on the left and back, followed by a pause, one click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back takes a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool _ strokes.txt.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to reduce the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the tab. there is a slide control sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>

<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the button, the settings are reset to the last pressing of attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should first be switched off. if you are accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make aware of which places a mouse click is without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or spots in the browser window that does not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can use the mouse to use such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is ruckling, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse over, but also the wheels that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse over. as this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you need to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the loches in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or the finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system terminates the execution of & kmousetool; if you use an intelligent moving process in this case, this means that & kmousetool, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by letting the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool, using another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. the status of & kmousetool will be reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced abilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">It is useful for improving the pronunciation to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, to choose a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent certain shortcomings of voice synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-maker" works with a text. & tts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be drawn to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will resume again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message is breaking regular text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page you can welcome you with & kebox; someone who just enters the room. & kde; alerts are also news. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you encounter from the map card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four job types are handled in queues, except for the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen Readers while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the items to replace are delivered either as a word or a regular expression. it is delivered with predefined drawing tools such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; transducers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of delivery, some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaking selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. if you have set a female voice for example on the card board, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules for which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text will remain unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a notification, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it will be processed by all the activated filters which have been set up on the side. processing through the filter is done in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters will be deactivated from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of the filter, and the next configuration dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the setup of drawing tools you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference pattern. if these samples are found in the text, the text is exchanged in the text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filter. you can select this name as you like, it must be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string from the column.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that store or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries will be attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker writes one of the languages listed here. click on the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold the & Ctrl; key.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus; the & DBus; numbers you have to leave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copy-3432 shows, you can only copy it.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The design filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box use the filter when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison to words, the design filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s\\\ s\\ s\\ s\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reached via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter, you can send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the map editor, or to a speaker with certain features. you can for example set that texts are supposed to be read by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text is handed over to the filter, it searches for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker features that the program sends the text to & ktts; the speaker selection filter is selected by the speaker selection filter. the speaker selection filter can be overwritten by the speaker selection filter.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions are installed, you can call this by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>

<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. simply download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">The installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient for this case; not only, but also the development packages with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given on basic network technology, in the second, all of them are discussed by & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section will not replace any further knowledge of IP networks. in this attachment only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">At present, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be in the near future. this description is therefore focussed on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowledge of which IP address is assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the response of a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, the access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers large enough.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = of your own computer). the standard route is required for the IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a specified loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file sometimes changes dynamically, so it is not surprising if active DSL connections can be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in the SuSEconfig file. another stand as expected can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first thing was to create a surface for tar, which offered the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective unpacking. the second goal was answering a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; restores the band back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the band. recognizes & kdat; the pre-tensioning on the band will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the pre-tensioner, searches for the right index on your disk. can this not be found, you'll be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the icon will change for the tape drive to indicate that the band has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the band can now be searched through flaps of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to designing the belt, first the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band file must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat; this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat; it is necessary to formatted a band before use. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of the band, DAT drives do not have to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the band are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the band will automatically be integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right click on the local file tree and select the Save Files menu.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog box opens up. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the Backup dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in an entry for the drive. it will only be checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the item entry Test...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the testing process has been started, the dialog box displays for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for checking the check, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you restore the restore, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. it will only be the selected file or the subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog will appear for recovery. in this dialog you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the band indexfile using the bandspread. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder where the backup should be done. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only those files located on the same file system are found that are located on the same file system, as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystem can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files are backed up since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes that all files are backed up and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set via the menu item to set up... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is mounted, load to the drive. in some drives it is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, tries & kdat; to block the ejection in the belt drive. possibly this setting does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when the integration of & kdat files, the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option enabled, tries & kdat; the hardwareseider block size for the belt drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must tell & kdat; in any case the block size for your belt drive will be reported in each case.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should only record a memory block on the band. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is the hostname: seconds, with the hostname of the full name of the system on which the volume has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have been formatted since the era in which the volume was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archives that can be used directly with & GNU; - tar -versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system, or where the system supports the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system, or where the system is stored in the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced features try to be filtered and analyzed by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog, a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available, with their help to easily filter and sort the single protocol rows of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start attempts & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open. if you don't see this, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog, which is probably not associated with system wallet rights. the protocol files can normally be found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar after a selected criterion or after entered string. the list of the log messages will now be modified, so that only the log messages will be displayed next to the filter. in default, a protocol line will only be displayed if one of the columns contain the filter.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. in the log file system log, you can select the column process, for example, in the protocol file system log the column process, and also carry out the name of a process, so you will show & ksystemlog, all log lines which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. record lines of stage errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as log lines of level indication. the color representation of log lines can be turned off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to skip to new lines in the main window's context menu, in order to view all new record lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of several protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display it in the menu.</seg>

<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly developing into the control of the program starts when driving the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to make a machine on System V Init without having a new installation and re-formatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to run when you exit the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which is only once started.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even though it is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different points after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and edit the 3. if you have something confused, then you can repair it by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called stop. if he involves a S, the script will start the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server Runlevel, which is only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user runlevel, which & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: just drag one entry from the field of availability of system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts also between runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it elsewhere. this is only done by removing an entry from the area of disposition system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you prefer to copy them into a new realm. to copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and in the target area insertion -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorption number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorticians of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to enable the various workspaces (quit system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sortiernummer or the name of an entry manually, press the button to change the properties dialog. use the Tabulator key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept changes, or press Esc to reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before being executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; restoring changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in a single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have done some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions will simplify the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available that are needed from the system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply quit without notice when their configuration files are not present or wrongly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation relates to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
