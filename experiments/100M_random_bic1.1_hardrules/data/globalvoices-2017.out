although I had visited the United States at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely big .
like many of my generation , I have grown up with American movies , have shared American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had a such profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Cover , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter , who created the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration was only strengthened by the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equally minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had even written a very sham@@ eful love letter about his size . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his narrow @-@ face @-@ face .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 million votes , which he won in Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party nomin@@ ee candidate .
I was stun@@ ned .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to tune with people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , the people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ umps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung by Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for long , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits into the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people and who em@@ body their embo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump said his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the conflict with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they were either part of rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as raci@@ sts .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ fully and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears are not taken into account of the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these vot@@ ers have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cru@@ el decision to elev@@ ate a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( out@@ lines of the WC ) : as much as &quot; based on the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ ties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word game from white in a play@@ ful to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the big Van Jones , has exactly killed what America made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have always , America is welcome everyone .
for this land chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose story as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps there is a huge part of the white American of America this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say .
in all that I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mr Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ar the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who doesn &apos;t like that is like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received an impressive and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan joined the words : &quot; God thank you , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Tr@@ ump &apos;s country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is breaking my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ an city of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very narrow connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump , only 16 miles south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for some years now the La banda de música ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who have found an opportunity for over@@ coming the poverty surrounding them .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality that is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs of gangs .
but it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI comments :
as soon as they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to go to their big passion .
they are always laugh@@ ing and play with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the tur@@ tle you learn the day for day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mbone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Mü@@ ll
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - on instruments derived from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ constructed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling process began to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avio Ch@@ á@@ vez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the start time :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the g@@ arb@@ age The children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as a fact , which he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments from re@@ constructed material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( harmon@@ ic g@@ arb@@ age d@@ ump ) distingu@@ ishes the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;

and here they turn it into something beautiful .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing operations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published , a magazine that specifically addresses international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liby@@ an waters before serving the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore up@@ set and slightly inc@@ lined to welcome the crimin@@ als of this kind to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles are rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u reminds him of a senior citizen of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team which discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there .
in the end it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of the lo@@ oting of the stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , protecting the criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and are mut@@ ually beneficial when it comes to illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to record . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm eco @-@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ob@@ struct@@ ed by bureau@@ cratic obstacles , and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions take place in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can share with each other for example lists existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if they move on the open seas , by satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are found in forbidden areas . such susp@@ ect routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its captured fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the ships participating ships have a fan@@ fare , where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse the assumption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships can not be sold to their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worth@@ while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company , who advoc@@ ates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front door
the afor@@ emen@@ tioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD to recover lost sales , which lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fisher@@ men who enter into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , specification of ph@@ asi@@ en@@ amen , fish protected species and f@@ ishes in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ complete control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could catch illegal fishing and a land could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations susp@@ ect ships .
it has revealed criminal networks that had accepted fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found fle@@ eing vessels tra@@ cked and found .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us fairly far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to loc@@ alize susp@@ ects ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be developed will help you to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fisher@@ men use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at try@@ gg Mat Tracking , a NGO which is also concerned with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which can no longer be selected by satellit@@ es .
Cop@@ eland is helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the unden@@ i@@ able global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Navigation Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed throughout the world with the position of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a better picture of those who do what you do - that &apos;s simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources to the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has to run a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only for@@ getting crimin@@ als but also fri@@ gh@@ ten them .
ships that had previously exploited without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with the consequences , now know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have received a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats have more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there abo@@ ard tow@@ ing nets whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries have joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With safety is the goal of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s young@@ est member country in Somalia filed his first grand triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only was the ship used without license and were used by drag networks that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also hous@@ ed in forbidden waters that are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a particular , collaborative working method to protect the oc@@ eans will actually work throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London .

the street movements in Venezuela seem only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the aboli@@ tion of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into empty space by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the retreat of Venezuela ) can be seen both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central district of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and the Isl@@ a Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates steadily rising in the daily routine of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the rise in the administrative division of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the post@@ ure of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , collabor@@ ating at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and profits are among the highest all over the world ( inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) , and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching short@@ age of food and medicine , the referendum to give the country the chance to con@@ quer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .

the images of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time include an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confront@@ ations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the central district of Mar@@ ac@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed supporters of the government .
later she was able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry coats because they could otherwise be seen what many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , a inf@@ ographic activ@@ ates the round , which forms the extent of repression per day :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the dictatorship of the country has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for an administrative procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :

others values this protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which has been taken from their point of view against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather be dealing with critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !

this is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ in@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atro@@ cities in La Perla , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of C@@ ór@@ doba .
in the context of the great La Perla @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of C@@ ór@@ doba around his father , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now part of the great La Perla @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a province .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
it began with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret .

I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ ebe@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was dep@@ uty commander of the intelligence department of the intelligence department 141 in prison La Perla .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who recognized the extent of atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent on his child , and how this child sel@@ ects a way of rede@@ mption .
from sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made you friends with one of the ERP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , revolution@@ aries of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
this is why he ban me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be he@@ aled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the car , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small blan@@ ket of wrapped packages and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the s@@ lag , where the stolen objects were put down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a gren@@ ade and metal springs .
later I found out that they had fixed an end of a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person , which was straight there .
they gathered a man with gloves on the bed , poured it with water and drove him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there in it was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated and helped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians , who also was indi@@ cted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which nu@@ de people were covered with the face down@@ wards - all were swe@@ pt in hands and feet .
close to the entrance k@@ au@@ erten people stand still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prison@@ er , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; struck a man there and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to details of survivors checked by the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Perla @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Perla Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you come here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look on the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war Resist@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war powers are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military ban , which one has fought against one enemy .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the head of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crimin@@ als and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who sm@@ ote the cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded against anger , sm@@ ote me and cried ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need no one else ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so my father was .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a Roll@@ kra@@ gen@@ pullover from Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Perla .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time , the defence was accused of being a con@@ spiracy in this crime . I ref@@ uted , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .

I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have been exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship of the dictatorship , but what the bodies disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but what their bodies disappear ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those people did not even have families to whom one could give up their mort@@ al remains ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ om@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were sh@@ attered and disp@@ osed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you have killed men ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clari@@ fy it : I have nothing against the military .

I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience for his sake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ visi@@ bly rejected and asked me why the whole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patri@@ ot@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried out :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you have killed men ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .

Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest and before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful freedom of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Perla @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 . op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases imprisonment for 2 to 14 years .
eleven of originally 54 accused died during the trial .

in the Japanese town of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his license , last month witnesses of a very special ab@@ used translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word of signatures called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fortunately - perhaps also with b@@ ös@@ em back@@ ge@@ ons &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
the mistake was taken by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also aware of the local newspapers on it .
Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , published in Ky@@ oto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Holmes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was removed first . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coup drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , even gramm@@ atically not entirely correct designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture had ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before being published .
a Blogger told me about the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sinc@@ er@@ ely regre@@ t that elderly people felt ins@@ ult@@ ed by the in@@ adequate correction of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News continued to deal with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers that are involved in accidents , but quite an occasion for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , resulted in a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior sen@@ iors had 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
during the number of accidents , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period of time .
the particularly non @-@ named rep@@ orter brought comments in the published version of the article on the light that show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seemed to he@@ ap against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So bad is the translation really not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so widespread in all Asia &quot; &quot; &quot;
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all over Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and to transfer active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the belief that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
in this way a French native speaker should translate into French into French - not from French into English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language , which can be translated into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for the over@@ coming , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , leave the company intern@@ ally . then the Japanese employee , whose English language skills are considered the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
the translation is only for help because we do not guarantee the accuracy of the contents .
the wor@@ r@@ ying and enig@@ matic phrases that arise through machine translation demonstrate that this technique can &apos;t replace any human interpre@@ ter for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the wei@@ rd English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints , which often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but from large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more thorough translations .
the city of Ky@@ oto will hopefully make a bigger source of its translations in the future .

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the University she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride for her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one called Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her min@@ der@@ age son or her min@@ der@@ year daughter to another , more rich family . in the exchange the child receives food , education and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the framework of a contract you cannot lift up .
this practice is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous dis@@ comfort of human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of boys and girls .
in doing so , she talked with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ched and den@@ oun@@ ced .
she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gra@@ titude which is vacc@@ inated by Cri@@ adi@@ tas , guarantees silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl and justify their exploitation by faith , that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no training and maybe even star@@ ved .

in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , is a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed heavy stro@@ kes . shortly there@@ after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military @-@ member Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck a stick on Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly wounds .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , who were deeply rooted in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic society , were responsible for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they marked the Cri@@ mean az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest and called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos became widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .

they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art - if the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ay@@ sia is a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to sign up and lost his work .
their brothers now had to work and started to sell candy on the street or on the market to earn money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Tina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) 06.11.2015 &#124; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days for example clean@@ sing the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home and had time to learn .
the more they were done with learning , the more leisure had it .
but this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but got no unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house as eating out of the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the House of House , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ists of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ en@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the hosts Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , along with him and read editorial articles from opposition newspapers such as Sender@@ o , or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner had found someone who list@@ ened when he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn poor habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would once again speak their native language guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord fear@@ ed that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose again , declar@@ es them .

even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is Mob@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .

I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I particularly appreci@@ ates that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job ads for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s children in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
Hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .
please tell you .
start starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a young girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the state that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look at if it works with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .

draft bill prohib@@ its Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image from Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently approved a bill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating the regulations concerning the use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users and users have to register social media in Egypt by a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which allows citizens to use a permit to make citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law , users and users must register on the website of the site with their right names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a money rep@@ ent@@ ance .
the bill consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is adopted when it is assumed , as the draft cannot impose a hint on how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the users &quot; registration . un@@ clear is also how they are to set up those who do not record themselves in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ ed and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users from the telecommunications ministry provided a user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to set a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egyp@@ tians and Egyp@@ tians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
from the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , the Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have no doubt on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could do violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will be set up a strong monitoring system to apply citizens who request a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plen@@ ary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military art in parliament , in whose meaning the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y struck a bill against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality in which a life imprisonment for those intended to be found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish natur@@ ist protects the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards in the war drawn by war

high above in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Tier@@ guards H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the intellectual Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that argue through Africa and Asia are among the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Con@@ servation of Nature .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Raz@@ a in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ard the only remaining pre@@ dator in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the flour@@ ishing of the ecos@@ ystem depends on the fact that a large beast of prey is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild@@ card is low and goes against zero . when the team is aware that they have a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained , Biolog@@ in shows Raz@@ a passionate about another side of their country , which is not only made of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Specialist Group and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , has been able to re@@ build the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; from March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom bomb in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ agi pre@@ f@@ ecture . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ agi was a real pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear whole coastal cities from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture was still experiencing a nuclear accident , and only 16@@ ,000 residents had to leave their homes .
the special report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows that progress has been reached six years later in order to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese recovery authority and survey results of the affected person themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare houses were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures has been recorded in Mi@@ y@@ agi , where 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still trying to settle for six years after the disaster , ev@@ ac@@ uation by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ accommod@@ ation@@ zentrum &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the triple cat@@ astrophe almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced into living quarters .
in December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ agi , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such places .
almost 40 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima in 2011 were still living in emer@@ gen@@ cies , whereas Mi@@ y@@ agi were more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation ev@@ ac@@ uation measures were moved in final houses .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the disaster , opened their doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have been res@@ umed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of ag@@ r@@ arian land have attracted a large area of compassion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ agi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agriculture in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 acres of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima lie in the &quot; nuclear &quot; zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to ev@@ acu@@ ate those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us disaster , nuclear accident , Japan ever had to experience .
from 16@@ ,000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima there were almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in lasting replacement houses .
according to the state of 2017 , more than 40@@ ,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hima live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation ev@@ ac@@ uation ev@@ acu@@ ated , older than 50 years old . they are well @-@ known because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects .

when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of Into the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Podcast , we look closely with these global connections . in our Into the Deep List@@ ings we treat topics that often get less attention in coverage than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love for music has brought her aff@@ ection to Iranian culture . Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Joey A@@ you@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

his condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás conf@@ essed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident by the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive station , his face would be in television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .

Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to protest against demonstr@@ ators over the last Friday .
polic@@ emen were at protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where prot@@ esters had set up a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mer@@ sho@@ ots and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peac@@ em@@ akers ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers all over the country .
once again , the Brazilian media stre@@ aked road protests by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were target@@ ing a broken glass window in order to create illu@@ stra@@ tive titles with a photo .

this must also be recognized when you are stri@@ kt against any form of damage .

the villages in Cuba from the Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Munici@@ p@@ ality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as El Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no notable sugar harv@@ esting on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane plants were laid down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land@@ fill the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the smell of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re @-@ find themselves .
some altern@@ ated the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ end daily to the factories , which still grin@@ ds .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane plants in the east of the region , which are back after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remembered that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the calm for the country several decades but the bad harv@@ ests are already no news .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane plants were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they were not viable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which su@@ gar@@ s sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 Euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined su@@ gar@@ s will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agriculture Auth@@ orities &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Economic and Food Organisation .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an president Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the reduction of a total of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he repeated most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
to ensure that the place is received , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first appearance of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recognized documents relating to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility was overwhel@@ med and the letters came more and more frequently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane plants in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he as@@ sures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
it was against his will at the stand@@ still of the factory where he helped build it .
with every part that he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most important industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important work of work was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases no alternatives were created for the work stations and services that were generated in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would be done well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extra@@ cted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the Munici@@ p@@ ality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory shut , or better said than they began to disman@@ tle it , they stopped to tar@@ nish the road , and also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without the prospect of the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
nine and forty harv@@ ests bring the old soldier to spend two thousand p@@ eso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a lon@@ ging person , yet he gives the lies that he told him .
they squ@@ e@@ eze him for ten years .

the workshop asc@@ ends that the young participants in conversation themes such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they do in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations @-@ communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ neb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the K@@ ite sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in West kan@@ ada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .

many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers do not always know the languages of the First Nations .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in close proximity to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; Plas@@ tic models of dishes &quot; ) are issued by each food that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the hec@@ tic district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies that have been able to produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even see them anymore . however , a new trend , however , is now transformed into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
in Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the Blogger Sur@@ in@@ i series published by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated cell phone straps , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial food were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , cooling cabinet magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin radi@@ ators for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als becomes increasingly complex .
in this case , a Kais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with se@@ afood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as mobile phone stand .
also this part was made for the exhibition at the Tokyo Railway Station .
and here is an apple that contains your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing departure to the coming .
some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .

a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ er@@ ers and we@@ eds regularly appear in statistics . however , these are not reflected in the extent of human tragedy that brings this fight .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , someone looks at the gri@@ ev@@ ing or on the communities who have lear@@ nt to live with pain .
there are behind every body , behind every bone structure in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never be cured .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; ap@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trade &quot; ) , they are called to give these sacrific@@ es a voice and told stories of people who were killed in the fight between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized crime is not only about our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore whole communities need to drive a lot of kilometres to buy something as easily as milk .
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells about these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches for every weekend secret gra@@ ves after his son .
and Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez that lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we have asked ourselves to go , and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should return back , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;

you are the insurance of my father , but they do not pay them out because they require a mort@@ al certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ mentation and the state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a writer of Animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been known for several years now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the titles with pictures , which can only be taken from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only person who is disgu@@ sting or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she writes further :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year c@@ ousin thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law@@ less@@ ness of the people is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbor@@ ing location will be justified that they were &quot; dom@@ ic@@ iled . &quot;
I think they are trying to convince them that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and still .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ werke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als were squ@@ ee@@ zed for month money from their business until they were destroyed not only the business , but also had torn apart their family apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or killing you .
I have asked myself in these terrible days if I would dis@@ solve my deep rooted feelings , but the answers are no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions about how : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?

in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ als per day .
these are only a few of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .

the reason for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was fal@@ sely represented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place in Paris for two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ br@@ äu@@ ous use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ understand@@ ings ; Africa check has been documented by Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
a step further will bring personal comments like this example fal@@ sely the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange came in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash @-@ message , published by the United Nations , those who were fle@@ eing fle@@ eing , ra@@ pe , and some dead , some of them burned by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following that brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this image origin@@ ates from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which has been fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to be@@ have this information .
the original article , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source , had also been fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not been associated with the picture from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from everywhere around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo will NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein being granted to 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain therein .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am published by the Catholic near An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , explicitly declar@@ es that the image does not origin@@ ate from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;

the picture of the DR Congo changed , provided with this Twit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and resolved a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ aken as proof for the mass@@ acre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 Male twe@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim is to raise attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Indon@@ esian ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , in circulation , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the message in which the picture taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ aries Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced himself .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .

( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original publication of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original article is not available or accessible .

the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how African life is compared to a European or French life .
religion can understand and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth@@ while to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally played the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suggested this mood of mis@@ understand@@ ings and false information that actual atro@@ cities are unt@@ rue and decor@@ ates it the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ holding of pictures of a ref@@ usal is equivalent to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ zing readers and spectators and take them the ability to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study that under@@ stands how violent media works on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be dis@@ solved from the context or completely ab@@ used .
an examination of false attri@@ butions should also be taken into account as internationally they can be .

a blog with the name of un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.@@ g . irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resi@@ sts stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you will find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - trouble your parents in recognition of how to have tried yourself in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun in cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;

they ent@@ angled other cultures , reve@@ aling other thought processes and aw@@ aken our curi@@ osity .
sometimes you may influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page and show more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .

I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has built themselves in their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they kidn@@ ap me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit there , are mis@@ used .

this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
what kind of images do you think about it when you think about it ?
love ? go to the top of the page
peace ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a huge part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ised Western books for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images rise further today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remain ste@@ ad@@ fast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narrative would domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this nar@@ ra@@ tives over@@ shadow the reality that led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US hasn &apos;t even able to choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ ra@@ tives fail to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ ra@@ tives weak@@ ens Muslim women who guide the movements for change .
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans that had been hi@@ det@@ ained with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous , that often Sik@@ h men and children will become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion people
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , which help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims do so in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to be Muslim is to speak the prayers that they had said to me if I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah is Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who have been colon@@ ised over centuries - by an &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; which has formed a company with the name Ehr@@ lich@@ é Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an American Muslim means knowing that the self @-@ mor@@ als have risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy of the United States is being pun@@ ished and the susp@@ ect holds a Muslim name , the story is more reported about four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a fre@@ ed black slaves named Bil@@ al .

to be a mother means to care for my child and establish all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged individuals establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ sters that began with President Bush and were wi@@ ped out under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders against people from just the countries that are bom@@ bar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and neb@@ ulous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; list that largely accepts Ara@@ bs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we reject in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .

but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global time point where we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason for con@@ spiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years earlier , they had not been given them ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as it was my daughter , but that made me today an un@@ circum@@ c@@ uted Muslim .
things that I left here as a bread cr@@ um@@ my in my speech .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , there may be a story where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , accounts of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are taking place .
more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us , or read us in our newspapers .
Pitt@@ ella : IMF should stop playing with fire and learn from past mistakes . Greece must remain in the Eurozone ( EN / GR )
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I count this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are managed and people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , before four decades have been science of Stan@@ ford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to put ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of that , consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bar@@ ded countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people bom@@ bar@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Text Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , an un@@ mistak@@ able blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to receive and honour the language variety of large cities .
in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Dar@@ win in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been performing events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - secure rooms in which residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to value , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stories tell stories first in their own language and then explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional hist@@ orian , their dedication and presentation will lead to the audience to be list@@ ened to it .
they call laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows a traditional history of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the narrative art for their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of Haz@@ en and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after having explained the meaning of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his feeling of Inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have list@@ ened to !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ elling performances .

on the last 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started with the puert@@ ori@@ ally Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proc@@ laimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Deu@@ ter@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Bürger@@ front for the ne@@ ural check of the debt ) and the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
a peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States has also submitted a peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are demanding that the politicians , banks and government authorities responsible for the deb@@ ts are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in public deb@@ ts , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will press and supp@@ ress .
the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with decl@@ ining pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island is not integrated in the territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; propos@@ es an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law of state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; measures will be carried out from the outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration took the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing since over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and families continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference for digital culture , hosted in Berlin , is dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .

the book published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of paragra@@ phs that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book is intended to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what is the true cost with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side on page to look over the m@@ ist that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acc@@ laimed internet volunteers since March 15 , 2012 in Syria .
his name was painted in the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current status or wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?

in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strict &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executed command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they were cont@@ acted by people on 12 November 2015 , who were themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .

a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia has played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and to knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ rew , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently transl@@ ating the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which established Bass@@ el writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of bas@@ sels of cultural prot@@ otypes was prec@@ ari@@ ous than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross @-@ cross of numerous civili@@ z@@ ations and here mel@@ ting Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Per@@ sian influences .
Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage , but the world embo@@ died .
this Strei@@ f@@ zug in the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
so far , Bass@@ el has not yet been able to shut down this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and I taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me in English , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other in@@ mates , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually kept a in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ state uch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with anger on a corruption case where a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption has been committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other accused of em@@ itting 54 million me@@ tic@@ al ( approximately 800 000 euros ) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice Cam@@ b@@ aza was standing between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately demanded his return to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the Attor@@ ney General Public Prosec@@ utor of the Republic who made the request , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to his old post , as the company did not perform a discipl@@ in@@ arity after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short CI@@ P ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the German Welle the decision of the company to re @-@ place the director again :
provides a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and even a retro@@ step in view of the efforts of our legal system , so the CI@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the contra@@ dict@@ ory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company apparently seems to have no appropriate legal action for the application of the respective functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , ref@@ uses this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ rever@@ sible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ able after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could be advised and poli@@ te his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .
to be honest !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil , the director had no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewar@@ ded by the state because he ins@@ ult@@ ed it , I cannot believe that someone is ins@@ ult@@ ed in such a way that the state has already ins@@ ult@@ ed the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is lacking the mor@@ als to return to the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served only by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ shake it became a in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , that man has become tired , charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence .

in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely valuable con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra @-@ Nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to combat hate language in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be linked with rac@@ ism , but the word is not automatically called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hate speech &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about the use of the word .
in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ical words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese too &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( cham@@ el ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar oat &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ arc@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ lish A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was extingu@@ ished today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
but he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they knew how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain by making a word @-@ game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will reduce hate language by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical than to dis@@ semin@@ ate all the posts made in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automatic dis@@ ruption will not be understood what you write on Fac@@ ebook@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dre@@ ad@@ ful nation@@ alists , who spread hate language , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action is a strong signal to anyone who likes hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not be held long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of dr@@ ummer is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is banned from the social network :

iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and told me the lyrics , items and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the post was not met by the Facebook community standards . &quot;

only even more hatred within the different communities will lead to ti@@ ze such words .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; are banned .
even when they found their mistake they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefit they would have a big turnover would be great .

instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some scre@@ en@@ shots of Facebook @-@ posts that didn &apos;t contain any hate language but nevertheless removed :

in the last five years there are extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to increase their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech is to heat the violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confront@@ ations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .

but instead of having c@@ ens@@ hr@@ ise the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to read more about context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end with the children &apos;s toe

the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament approved a law that is supposed to offer this practice , so that the fair is now at 18 .
at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , a group , the representatives of the different religious groups of the country gather that the State should not interv@@ ene , since that , age is not determining maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every man under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were stri@@ ving to aboli@@ sh laws for children , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s wo@@ e , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition ensured ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would ever agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s wo@@ e - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;

after having been determined before the Senate , the draft can now become a law .

but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
before months Mah@@ ar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise .
while the Attor@@ ney General Paris Al R@@ awi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite right when Mah@@ ar@@ aj wants to go against the law , most social media users wish to address the debate .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear satellite , if we , instead of discussing the discussion in general , in a way that we only invite the state into our bedroom , &quot; simply target@@ ing the state , our daughters , that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ bo@@ died men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , these legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they say .

since over a month Turkey has now been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based ency@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day for day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share information .

although many technology @-@ based internet users are used to use converting tools for blocked web@@ pages ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been reading article by Wikipedia , recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform provided all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ators ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content is available in spite of legal prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to read sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform .
this can help users to view all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was implemented independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about scre@@ en@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Vi@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the sperm .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia , Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mirror , an open source project that everyone can use to host up similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages when viewed by Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses its camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ urred with poor@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and well @-@ made colors .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ tune to the international stage .
and his hom@@ et@@ own right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nep@@ tune &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook as it assi@@ sts this first @-@ class situation in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I rested straight at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj called me ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River was a Leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the Tourist Office of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him , and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ el images ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to collabor@@ ate with the authorities to att@@ ain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ tune &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding of that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
and he should know it , for he arose from face to face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the mind of the sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the King of the Bush appeared . he immediately res@@ ett@@ ed , we see us and he star@@ ed through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for resource &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ tune nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even from older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s husband due to social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should abuse the norm to get this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convi@@ cted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a bog@@ us court , and rejected by her family and the community after she had addressed a married family with names .
the tradition of their wives also does not belong to the name , is also widespread among men . however , they have much less allow@@ ance to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health guards as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly become the main topic of the city .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the details of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ w has been working with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as child &apos;s marriage to ex@@ ile HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts this club .
she reports about how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them to ambass@@ ad@@ ors of the change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands on behalf of their hus@@ bands .
she has decided on this topic because she wanted to talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women could easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of her hus@@ bands will not speak lou@@ dly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bre@@ eder that they maintain all duties and never ques@@ tioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook inst@@ agram tum@@ blr twitter
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and desires a long life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who does not consider this is considered to be un@@ il@@ ateral , as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tradition is rooted so deeply that we have never made any thoughts until this discussion round .
in the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to try to try out their hus@@ bands at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
testimon@@ i@@ als writ@@ en for orders that include :
my mother in law and my husband was silent for a long time after the video was at the end .
practice , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ w from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women should never speak the name of her hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
testimon@@ i@@ als writ@@ en for orders that include :
a woman was so timi@@ d that she had only ch@@ ich@@ ened throughout the exercise , and another decided to leave the entire fru@@ stration toward him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the ad@@ ren@@ alin out of it , having broken down with an old bread , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation was carried out in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the foreh@@ ead that indicates the sp@@ ouse :
why do only women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he also wanted it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed just and I stopped to wear it .
the other women did not complete it completely , but think they were in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any point of discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last few months she celebrated her own bir@@ th@@ days with cake ; she d@@ anced and sang about things about which she never had ever thought .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working for many years in these problems and yet I also have spoken about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are knot@@ ted to our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ est@@ ly .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion group we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , it is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ oon @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt on a pants , wearing them ; they didn &apos;t tar@@ nish .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes , mor@@ als connected to the sar@@ is and much more , g@@ lit@@ tering Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ isph@@ eres ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and raw materials are sure they will be able to create it .
on the question whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed slightly , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly moving into rolls :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made little steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to tell the name of her husband .
some , including me , do not make it yet , but only if they are alone and not other family members .
only one or two still predi@@ ct the name of her hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ ead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the flan@@ k to find more freedom of movement or their own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ lier , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi .
one of the victims has been found and a part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and in consequence they were arrested by the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .
it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a black @-@ headed man could bring gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia declared the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on smooth @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN 2016 to investigate a mission in South Africa in order to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ lier , where the assass@@ inations were held .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that local police are already following the case :

the persecution and murder of gl@@ amor@@ ous individuals for obtaining and selling their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably ab@@ u@@ sive ritu@@ als , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power to gener@@ alize the riches .
in recent days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Samanth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the major social difficulty that Mos@@ ambi@@ k faces :

the case of the imprison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o , has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state end@@ anger@@ ing ) after the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to av@@ ail calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries have cri@@ tici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should pres@@ ume pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to make treatment abroad .
Norwegen &#124; QX GayMap
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ umed only in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the sal@@ mon crew to China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously disturbed , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release for expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to take his prize in Oslo .
due to his arrest , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us as she spoke in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and able to communicate freely with the outside world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in@@ so@@ far as it can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message to the Chinese authorities not only release Li@@ u but also liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the re@@ sign@@ ation of the US em@@ bass@@ y drew up an angry response from China , with the exterior of the Foreign Ministry , that &quot; no country has the right to interv@@ ene in un@@ reasonable and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple following the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel and access to medical care of his choice , based on the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally un@@ condition@@ ally .

the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was on the 7th and 8th of July on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the vert@@ eb@@ rate of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs required China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds : &quot; &quot; &quot;

although the news agency France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually absor@@ b it .
Taiwan , Province of China
the Council of the Administ@@ rative Affairs in Taiwan required China on June 27 , to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance towards those who want to use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature called Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party called China to allow the ill intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .

the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dal@@ ai Lama , showed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us being well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been sever@@ ely pun@@ ished , led to a more harmon@@ ious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens are inspired by Li@@ u Xia@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
welcome to Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem foo@@ lish as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog osphere .
during the meeting of a meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of the State New York , the minister noted that many people cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one has ques@@ tioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people go to an error .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we hear that we are ultimately no country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory inj@@ us@@ tice .
Singapore , if you are not my country , where country is it then ?
the reasons were not very no@@ bles : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , it seemed in@@ definitely un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco and New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old suffering arises from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ cr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to her power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is not a matter of fact , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am to clari@@ fy his opinion , as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point when he was paid up in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
when An@@ on publish@@ es his comment on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire presentation of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compar@@ es Singapore to cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am who is as leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ de , what awa@@ its me - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it , and is aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review cr@@ ushes the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der person ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ore@@ ans pay their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom must our prime minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ m , Singapore is and was always a town :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ ore@@ ans ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that pass around one .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main property of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ lined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ er doesn &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bours .
we lack the warm , open friend@@ liness which I now connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ deau explains the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ens Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band released a music video released by the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and in spite of its promises to restore the civil government , continues to reg@@ ain the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what prec@@ ep@@ ts him his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not expressly political , the music video is indi@@ rectly related to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the song was a huge success .

&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it acts with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of Girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which provides absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th Rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army to supervis@@ e online content and persons who are accused of having committed the mon@@ archy to have criminal prosecution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict statement against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( honor of honor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct XHTML 1.0 Transitional XHTML 1.0 Fra@@ mes@@ et
two days later , it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery van before getting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in prison because they are allegedly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by long prison sentences , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it is now over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has been termin@@ ated , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ mac@@ ava are in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ ck of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Gre@@ eks , Sou@@ theast Asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to the Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today live for the largest part of the Russians and ch@@ ases in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ er@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after having barely reached over a decade .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk with you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all the community .
now there is only pav@@ ed road with most blown spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plan economy of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ is@@ z@@ hov@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , recogni@@ zes the balconies where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother is not allowed to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply has forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as liv@@ estock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is too . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ MA and published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink diamond frame and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ären @-@ Form .
it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name M@@ om Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather she herself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm whatsoever .
for about 2.50 euros the night sleep guests in simple rooms , with bare , b@@ ump@@ y walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also sle@@ pt outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and bring them to hospital if they are sick , they buy them medication which they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ ache ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that there are African women very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston in order to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , to take a first stop in South America and move towards the north .
the family had heard from other compan@@ ions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often traveling together and that Afri@@ cans are talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his compan@@ ions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that her guests will often send text messages when they have gone to gre@@ et them or to report her over the course of her journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have brought her to make chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family mig@@ rant in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has noticed that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ aner .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside .

I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants who travels through tap@@ ah@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova , Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to press money without having a plan .
in Wall@@ ach@@ ula , he was asked for accommodation and a well @-@ known , a remote @-@ looking woman , has offered him her roof .

back to the home of Mama Africa is again full of guests .
in the corri@@ d@@ ors , the travelers con@@ sul@@ ate their teleph@@ ones .
a small bus arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she bl@@ ends her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that you made a Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .

on 10 July , the phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the City Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it indicates the District Government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because it was just after they had installed the app to ex@@ changed messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the Noti@@ fication of the Police , the app would determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ su Tel@@ ecom .
the main feature is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online and remote control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can naturally be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers capable of manipul@@ ating or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and the South , reality is very often glo@@ om@@ ers for those who live in distant , displac@@ ed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting from the fact that the software can lift the passwords for a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ sh@@ akes .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and the party related facilities , including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions given by Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , a U.S. human rights organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decre@@ e on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the local police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible purchases , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but when you get the reality back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the performer , the characters transform into being of flesh and blood , and everything sh@@ ud@@ der after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth moves on the axis of the dis@@ astro@@ us . it becomes clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but it wasn &apos;t enough to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the Security Council form@@ ulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us by destro@@ ying the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn up during a peaceful protest like a weed out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to make the town the darkness of night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the districts of the city , only my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , it was silent , rel@@ ent@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that was stopped in the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night , things had to calm down after the power supply was stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contra@@ dict@@ ory by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me , and we joined us to a magnificent picture that ful@@ fills my expectations full and ful@@ filling .
in such a moment , you are aware that you release the Spirit out of the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t be interested in doing anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready to meet us at military security buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have made it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts talking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ ageous enough if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hair @-@ filled eyes turned on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad to see me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was at my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never ceased to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regre@@ t no word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solit@@ ary and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father immediately with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corri@@ dor to the single cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am looking forward to hearing from you all the details before I enter the room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to share them with only one other prison@@ er and must immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I went back to a well @-@ established communication method : to beat the wall against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell osse was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells , a prominent man of middle @-@ aged cells , which is similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness there is no distinctive face to me , and doctors are not there ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sound ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all responses reflect its existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the large cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to have a bird &apos;s sh@@ y to drive all these cranes that lab@@ ori@@ ze themselves in the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from af@@ ar , I hear them cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of destruction , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the gre@@ eting in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung to 13 S@@ ure of Cor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was ventil@@ ated : to protect state security in front of us and to prevent the betra@@ yal and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ an dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fes@@ sion card and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view .
this is not a house where there is no land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
I enter the hearing room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and tall man ; at least he comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in spite of the face expres@@ sing him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest to demonstrations that will soon be an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have used it to me not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and b@@ lows have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how this was happening was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be pun@@ ished or badly needed to be pun@@ ished , although I had nothing to earn this sentence .
to be pun@@ ished in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gest@@ ure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your H@@ enk@@ er sle@@ eps himself to your cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cry did not kill him yet , why they ex@@ changed the pipe by a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a g@@ arb@@ age collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed together to present us from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated from them while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I ceased to cry .
the H@@ enk@@ er noticed the cooling and did not have any pleasure , which is why he was caught next to an electri@@ cally loaded rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two aw@@ ful hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to sleep again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some hours passed that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ sted yo@@ ungst@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk you , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sm@@ iles to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has been one of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faced the conservative majority and asks her old @-@ proven opinion about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deal with topics such as Oriental alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian p@@ oultry , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these themes will not only be found in his hom@@ et@@ own of Am@@ man , but also in cities committed by Damascus in Yemen to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he gets a special cancellation against American foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian p@@ oultry of the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and never existed in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a person , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sh@@ akes in water sol@@ ete N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ tim@@ ental hot Jun@@ it@@ day has little with protest against Islam .
basically speaking , the per@@ ch of lau@@ r@@ arian coffee and the s@@ ads of the Kent cigar@@ ette speak the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one raises a view into neighbor@@ ing countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to not land in prison .
recently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and the main reason for the concert statement .
the MP and former press spokes@@ man in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled &quot; just because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many asser@@ t that the band &apos;s involvement in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old proven legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be easy to sei@@ ze rhet@@ oric , but actually reflected a clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which is clearly apparent in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b recovered traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ dominant sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently un@@ familiar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust .
in the past few years , in Jordan , the number of &quot; honour kill@@ ings &quot; has been released - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor@@ ary mor@@ als reached its cli@@ max in 2016 . however , the institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to support women who were victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for inter@@ ruption of the year 1954 women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can be held in prison , &quot; and for their release it is often a long bureau@@ cratic effort , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman is nothing to happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for those who are not afraid of them@@ atic themes that have long considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asser@@ ts that his work is politically , however , that he is not confin@@ ed to his music , which is full of explicit experiences on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became a politi@@ cian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are in the core of the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song , a verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words , &quot; that can get what you want , &quot; whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ geneity or hom@@ osexu@@ ality .
he noted that barely anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbian , and that comments on the equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been heavily c@@ ens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context and had been c@@ ens@@ ored by his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but was only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against hom@@ osexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eigh@@ teenth century , who still remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later able to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph in the eigh@@ teenth century , could be open to hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do it ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took several former government delegates and members of the educational association , with the reason they would have cri@@ tici@@ zed on comment@@ aries in social media , who are deeply rooted in the country rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant progress and taking . Jordan has denied a performance for the second time , but the progress of progress - it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ war@@ dness and internal changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Ara@@ bs , even from an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be using music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , scatter @-@ uni@@ tions and artificial species . at least he hopes that .
as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b becomes further ra@@ ging and therefore resist@@ ing resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these large , extra@@ vag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the Fest@@ wagen , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over and from a time come to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ hi , to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a superb view .
you can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( Sum@@ tl ) .

rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate job like the hair@@ dres@@ sers .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ bers and illegal drugs are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual fresh@@ ness of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led that more and more common citizens can go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the dres@@ sage of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts in each other to show who can create the most ec@@ cent@@ ric looks like you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found a chance to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of getting bad advice to get a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work .
many young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud because from love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love Message of Guer@@ ill@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel alien@@ ated , aff@@ ection ?
this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ ici@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people are encouraged to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guer@@ ill@@ ab@@ ev@@ eg@@ ung FAR@@ C ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
International was the signing of the treaty as so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons in themselves must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear , and in some cases deep@@ ened deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now record their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would join together and help the integration process .
and exactly this did they also did : until now thousands of young people already wrote letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them again in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter , who should be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters , but those who forget that they need much more .
he continued to share his love with people who needed most urgent attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were transferred to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Munici@@ p@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to personally convey the letters .
the FAR@@ C members set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbeliev@@ able how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , &quot; the politi@@ cian student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila told her later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we passed the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of refuge in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL gran@@ at@@ werfer , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter written by someone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life , someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful compan@@ ions of this fighter , and he wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything other from life as a war . the FAR@@ C was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the fam@@ ine . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there , who wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I lear@@ nt only how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices : new Vo@@ ices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C came together to a discussion round .
the students were all raised up as already war and the FAR@@ C was already in secret .
this is why the FAR@@ C leader declar@@ es the history of the organisation , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social inj@@ us@@ tice of the State was working on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help to shape society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this order , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who had never found their hearing , and had no right to vote , and to recognize that the people , who were often seen as monsters and even had lear@@ nt even , were only people with beautiful feelings that were revers@@ ed by their lives and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the land lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that after dis@@ arm@@ ing peace would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from FAR@@ C now put on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be overcome many difficulties .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ ers living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide variety of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last months over the persecution of schw@@ ul@@ er men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hang@@ s like a di@@ amo@@ k worth over the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
OC media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q rights situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has been conqu@@ ered by the international head@@ lines for several months after reports have been published which themati@@ zed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of que@@ ers in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gas@@ ometer ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspected que@@ ers and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ gender , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they grew up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why they went to Moscow .
after a group had experienced Ch@@ echn@@ ya from the sexual har@@ ass@@ ment of her country woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a voluntary hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a friend of D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who stuck in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos taken from my documents by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App started the round .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I sens@@ ed something in my body , but I did not hurt myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you Sh@@ and@@ spot@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and aw@@ ak@@ ened last ends in the hospital .
apparently some women had taken everything along and started cr@@ ying .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two s@@ ore in my right lung wing .
OC media : in which ambul@@ ances were you laid - in which the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor understood and put me to women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ us name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some totally unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they set absur@@ d demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going up without through the streets ; others wanted me that I did not change my gender , that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad speech and Photoshop .

OC media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother was too much , and she laid a cord around his neck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately the neighb@@ ors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and already a few hours later under the window a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time it was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends reviewed the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I will not give her name but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unexpected .
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering without me , without proof without everything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived at and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plu@@ cked the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people know what hotel you are looking for . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove yourself : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the inter@@ course of sex , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo theme .
some traditionally k@@ au@@ kas@@ ical elements I still bear in me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really give my effort to see how the person looks out of her past - so on my mas@@ cul@@ ine form .
but that is very difficult .
OC media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who are d@@ ort@@ able ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for that I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months in a gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he didn &apos;t lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
that I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end ask a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine tells me there would be no very many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then , especially those who have no wealth@@ y relatives or who were abandoned by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Should they be converted , they will show their bodies on television , claim@@ ing they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply gone , they were deliberately immer@@ sed in order to radic@@ alise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or have you a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just want someone who was imprison@@ ed for one and a half months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was nothing new from them since .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was doing so when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports before . however , we assume that such actions are possible .
why otherwise wouldn &apos;t it be allowed to s@@ have these people to s@@ have ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already been held in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair always long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known already in Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the case of Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia just wanted us to approach the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were de@@ pressed ; I had dy@@ ed las@@ hes , wore tubes jeans and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Justice of the Sh@@ aria has never touched me only one hair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on week@@ ends , a whole group of people came like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never ins@@ ult@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it often says to children if they make fun about the sick .
OC media : so they simply have closed their eyes in front of you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never ins@@ ult@@ ed me , never h@@ unted and never beaten .
OC media : how long did this grace period stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality on television .
he did not talk about us , but rather about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could sense how people began to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who had been guar@@ ded and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic is steadily worse .
OC Media : what activity do you want to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I join them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a cent for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have discovered these people myself when I cli@@ cked the flood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hi@@ j@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
this is the nature that has absolutely nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who wish to proph@@ esy to you with foam before the mouth , that there are no bo@@ ils among them .
those who have the cab@@ ard@@ ines , who have the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet it gives them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from there , so it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to hear that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mos@@ que and fa@@ sten during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think in the tran@@ sposi@@ tion of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be accurate , different habit@@ ats .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ality within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months , there is a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ ality .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man named Jas@@ si@@ m Mor@@ avi@@ i on August 27 , the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ avia was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he felt his own help to rise to his family , Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video held on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ avi@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything anymore .
he died in a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has acquired in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot war@@ n that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month was some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their li@@ veli@@ hood .
before a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took power and 1925 great effort to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable sites for Iranian agriculture .
in spite of these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Ara@@ bs systematically places jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of trun@@ ks , the waters of the Arab areas in the Per@@ sian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only lead to devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness caused devast@@ ation , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ als among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Do@@ hi@@ mi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since functional and institutions do not pre@@ fers to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Ara@@ bs and force them to earn their li@@ veli@@ hood outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speech of Arabic language or carrying Arabic clothing .
in view of the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must end@@ ure , human rights activists defeat the alarm before the situation is explosive .

when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist femin@@ ist - with fru@@ stration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ through scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of life have come to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender still attracts through the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and known to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I suffer double and triple . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk on skin color , rac@@ ism , black c@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I talk about what kind of physical , psychological and verb@@ al abuse have been ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists choose to be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raise their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and the origin of origin deserve less deser@@ ving than white men and women .
that black girl and girl with a migration background more often of school are referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ heres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want that all men , all men and all men , all men and all men have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot connect myself as a black woman , whose centre is the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider inj@@ us@@ tice in their mind , which relate to both the gender and the skin color of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , who always rejected me and in@@ numer@@ able other black women and always rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an essential and mar@@ gin@@ alized entity in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups , who also absor@@ b our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to deri@@ ve white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . some of them will continue to remain silent for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honour them for a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ism was established to give women from different approaches to a home and to limit themselves from white femin@@ ism , femin@@ ism is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself full and completely of femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being used for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women after our own ideas and go into the sp@@ heres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ismus : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only the black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be hon@@ oured in which the black woman is so successful .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ al femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ ati@@ sm and exclusion , after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as a woman as a part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and due to my existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life did not ignore , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a returned to the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in Kan@@ u - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to its church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a Member of the Non @-@ governmental Organisation of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , rivers and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was fil@@ med and issued for En@@ sia by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist , fil@@ med and published .
the main focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , little major sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help op@@ pressed communities to tell their stories in their way .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The we@@ eping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # so@@ unding @-@ smoking ) reported about the violence of women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect the people affected .
a police Commissioner told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ ile , who had become violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of its relationship , a little time has passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to abuse , the ac@@ ten@@ tive advertisement of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything .
some days later the second woman moved her ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Devil &apos;s circle of violence against women is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if women at all need to be displayed at all , they will generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to find how many women are really mis@@ leading , My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , which are not even clari@@ fied the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available , however , are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 , the District Attor@@ ney General Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office opened 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . at 70 % of it it was about violence against women .
86 % of the adverti@@ sements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace courts . here , 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the adverti@@ sements , 40 % of women said they were subjected to physical abuse , 55 % of women said of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minist@@ erin Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of 2014 , there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse .
since the suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities may not be able to document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .

the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , Paraguay died every ten days due to violence caused by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ go
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the name of all her former friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she en@@ du@@ red the psychological violence on its part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most notic@@ eable :
I never thought I would once become a victim of abuse .
if I read earlier about it , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they dec@@ eive themselves by violent men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote on Facebook , in which she described its ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people answered their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked the rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain in@@ nocence .
Victoria Santos , who does not origin@@ ate from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner viol@@ ated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yo te cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way of abuse of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s case everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealth@@ y partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vict@@ orian &apos;s advertisement in the authorities remained without the result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she introduced a process against her former partner who developed into an in@@ accessible legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ aj@@ as ( # fear@@ ing ) .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law looks ahead to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent pen@@ al structure and pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbor@@ ing countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the law has changed in some point to also win the ME@@ Ps for the law that fear@@ ed that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill fores@@ ees the majority of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) proc@@ ed@@ ural costs that have to bear the victims of violence at the moment , if they simply have an advertisement and would like to obtain a safe lodging , to give up the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relations .
here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must rei@@ mb@@ urse for a long time until the treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage yesterday that the partners called in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions of the changes are apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Marktanalyse - The Future of the Make @-@ Up Market in Oman to 2018 - Market Size , Trends , and Forecasts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked by a resolution of the Minister of Information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he f@@ ates one year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ dis@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but came back later .
Oman is ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ibn S@@ aid since 1970 when he came to power after he had finished his father , S@@ aid ibn T@@ aim@@ i , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
since then he has been dressed in addition to his role as the sole Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Colonel of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of the security forces , in particular of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ ction and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blogger and other activists , inti@@ mid@@ ated and imprison@@ ed .
the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , their closure and imprisonment for three of their editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 has been reported about Cor@@ ruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , held an article with the title &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . in that , corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the introduction of the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Dis@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was charged from ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS participated in the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as chief editor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed on an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Information received the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the Trial Chamber held the first hearing in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Dem@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists in prison and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convi@@ cted of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ gra@@ ding of the State &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ha@@ j &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also found guilty to the violation of a public ban and the s@@ lander of embar@@ rass@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year imprisonment and bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy of 3,000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 78@@ 00 US dollars ) .
al @-@ demoli@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a penalty of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after the use of an information network to spread material which could pose a threat to public order , &quot; found guilty .
for Al @-@ Dem@@ i a deposit of 5,000 om@@ anic re@@ ef ( 13 000 US dollars ) was arrested and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgement of judgement .
the App@@ eals Court pronounced Al @-@ demoli@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but said Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the detention of his 6 @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Prison in Mask@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the App@@ eals Court also appe@@ aled the decision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to close the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to aband@@ on Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper seems to be suspended by the Boli@@ vian government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister presented another trial against the decision of the App@@ eals Court to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman was injured in the press freedom in Oman .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the local authorities are still not willing to provide an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of press freedom .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zam@@ bia , picture takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the needs of medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing , which cover the particular medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a major impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lacking investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , the research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zam@@ bia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zam@@ bia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first grave consequences on national health .
he left Zam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zam@@ bia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of media about this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier is talking as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
GM : what &apos;s your opinion about the important recent scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ v@@ ables instead of being bl@@ unt themselves .
the solutions we get are often not used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .

is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the projects are different well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or prefer , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .

what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are many interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
the system that magazines can only be made available to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .

Frank Mort@@ on has already been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ posts , the first plant that was grown and consumed by NAS@@ A a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only given by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ ads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ er he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red@@ dish or green or cra@@ w@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as cereal and cardboard boxes . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food safety concerns the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still gains a salad , but he now needs longer since his work is becoming more and more difficult because his work is becoming more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a river is lying in a river that I have to feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents are going far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can cultiv@@ ate more sal@@ mon sor@@ es because all the features are patented . &quot; he thus makes as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; trains ) .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like this as if the movement from the IT area origin@@ ates and not from the area of vegetable breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used to permanently be used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called shortly O@@ SSI , US bre@@ eders may commit themselves to freely use the seeds used by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders allow others to cross their seed to breed them , and it is not immediately disp@@ rop@@ or@@ ated - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
dark prospects for the future
for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ SSI , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg has control over the seed and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seed capital plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as bi@@ odiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg states that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing their seed to others . this means that their action is to be patented in contrast to the seed and plant characteristics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed because the available recovery pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , is shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SSI , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carr@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about one third of all the packaging characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which means that it is not usable for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult to use .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are still patented as a salad or carr@@ ots .
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ bility
plants are cultivated so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from such by which their taste or color improves to such , due to which they can thri@@ ve in certain environments and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or ill@@ nesses .
opponents of patents on plant properties prove that the available plant material is ab@@ duc@@ ted for bre@@ eders through ever more patents . genetic diversity is now more necessary than ever before , since the modified conditions caused by climate change are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Sprech@@ erin Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and the co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company speci@@ alis@@ es in the conservation of genetic diversity .
however , it does not contradi@@ ct that intellectual property is other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innovations . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not prevent innovations , but also promotes more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
and if you have to wait for a long time to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on bot@@ her@@ ed himself to patent plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how plants do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. State Oregon and O@@ SSI , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is breeding a variety , also b@@ lows his own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed for which her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , b@@ red in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the sponsor@@ ship or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worth@@ while or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding grounds .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by avoiding plant patents more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected from competition for 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the USA seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breed , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . the centre with farmers working together and helps them cultiv@@ ate new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for the bre@@ eds differ from country to country because the O@@ SSI obligation does not simply take one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conven@@ tionally b@@ red plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally planted plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch Organisation of Hi@@ v@@ os held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethi@@ opia , on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents of seed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently establishing a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled for the scheduled next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mer@@ ger from environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Concent@@ ration ) has put together a database on seed and bi@@ odiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Essen@@ s , has published a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - it represents the view that farmers have the opportunity to share and improve seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI hopes that it will soon recognize more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food@@ stu@@ ffs has hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to realize the people that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities still un@@ lock content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian Government closed the web site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about sel@@ ections .
August published the Network an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities cri@@ tici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic network for Human Rights Information remain bt@@ - despite this attack and the constitution of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should actually defend the law , to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web pages for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading colum@@ ns and articles which he does not write to in@@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog was built to deal with the Egyptian government &apos;s z@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , even the goal of an attack .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and took a video on how the police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students .
his article mainly revol@@ ves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed his blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to block is very old but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog is not significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege ; a arrest , a sear@@ ch@@ able murder , pre @-@ charge of the national security council , the lock blogs and any other website I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , alb@@ eit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first of all I used to handle items to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go along the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ daf@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers through which Internet C@@ ensu@@ s and private browsing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue blocking content and filters to access the Egyptian users .
the situation is also wor@@ shi@@ ped by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by means of which they can proceed in court against these actions .
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

day for day newspapers in all Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard moti@@ fs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ ked chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air@@ w@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation , the wave of violence in 2017 reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; &quot; &quot; extra will continue to tell about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything but what happens in Rio is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists not close our eyes in front of cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to prevent atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the designation &quot; War &quot; are protected more than it ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasil ar@@ gues that the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is the opinion of a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to draw responsibility for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ ple@@ asing negle@@ ct of public service .
as a remin@@ der : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Jan@@ eiro is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ats per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is part of the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which acc@@ entu@@ ates as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit , a police unit , whose aim is to con@@ quer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and permanently station@@ ed there .
in the beginning , this led to a decrease of violent deaths . for a few years , the U@@ PP developed several reports on ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Charle@@ aux , from one of his articles from 2010 , explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because this calls for the state to use resources and ways that are typical for a war . in addition , penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas are still suffering in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a week is now that the police will explain the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of kis@@ sing that had fired the police out of a helic@@ opter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to vict@@ ories Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the Research Institute of the Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly strongly affected the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons promp@@ ted the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out on the basis of exam@@ ining the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre was practi@@ sed by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these rebel groups have been controlled outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which led the inhabitants to be used locally or by tun@@ nels and control points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the years of block@@ ade traditional food such as meat has become indispensable for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food sources &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional , planted food in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian kitchen . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive nutritional source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to dis@@ continue this project and expressed its relief that it is now more and more &quot; becoming acquain@@ ted . &quot;
in agreement with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform c@@ ando in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ing mushrooms , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue until Monday , September 04 , 2017 , continue to collect donations to c@@ ando .
the initiative is dependent on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity of 80 % .
because of the fuel economy , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they began with the &quot; production of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pilgrims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mush@@ y breeding for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc . ) for obtaining new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with dis@@ abilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our struggle against hunger and si@@ ege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to help people in situations of crisis and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires , which gr@@ ass@@ ed in the week before in the north of Portugal .
two and forty persons died and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of 15th and 16th October . this led to the fact that the government launched a state of State last week in solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires have also been registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and many villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande suffered a similar tragedy , where 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded were wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite imag@@ ery , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burnt in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the serious situation : there are only in 4 districts no fire .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked themselves why civil protection was unable to com@@ prise the extent of tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Bund der farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ blic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere , there are dozens of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have been able to pass a similar tragedy as in June as the roads were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are asked with high risk of fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal to the forest form , which the government had brought to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues on the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ blic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees are made of light @-@ fl@@ amm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to the fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15th and 16th October , for residents information sought or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and became so crucial that the servers followed the storm of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires , not with@@ holding the site : the website numbered more than half a million hits .

two years earlier , a terrible civil war was broken between the different Mu@@ jah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a land of terror and desp@@ air .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat &apos;s leaders , was just murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself back in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his small salary and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mortar which were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his li@@ veli@@ hood .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t fro@@ ze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal to aid need@@ y .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high levels of arm@@ ing . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is improvis@@ ed facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an emergency centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum , which can be drawn up for months after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
until then people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so let it take A@@ shar@@ af . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but his un@@ cle of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free themselves from these conditions .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the foundation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he was still a second hostel after a while and opened a snapshot .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to documentation &quot; Behind the Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament veri@@ fies a bill that allows users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to be able to use the social networks , within six months after successful legislative decision on the website of the Authority , including its full name as well as their identification number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months imprisonment or a penalty of a penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was wor@@ shipped by six@@ ty parliam@@ ent@@ arians , lies in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in May , another MP had a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for ins@@ ult@@ ing the President or a high officials .
in Egyptian law , the debt of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the legislative proposal , however , such a fact would be pun@@ ished with prison and monetary pun@@ ish@@ ments , such as legal experts from the Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be approved , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the jud@@ g@@ ments .
in addition , this would under@@ mine a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen , who were demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who led to the dep@@ ortation of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited as more than 700 prot@@ esters who were arrested at the same incident , four years imprisonment on a trial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on May 20 , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ cris@@ y of others , illegal assembly , murder , and bad murder .
in another case , a criminal court addressed the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad@@ Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indi@@ cted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Moh@@ amed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .

in May , Tun@@ isi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .

does China want to force the users of social media to show their identity ?
according to the new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in the rules , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts susp@@ ect that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments can be reached within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed the social media to sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizens &quot; journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
