<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a such profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Cover, a fearless reporter, who created the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest.</seg>

<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to tune with people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>

<seg id="28">These people and who embody their embodied values deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump said his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The conflict with the idea that people voted for Trump because they were either part of racism and fanaticism or because they were ready to oversee these things, broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectfully and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very narrow connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 miles south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby precolonial ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La banda de música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who have found an opportunity for overcoming the poverty surrounding them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But it changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI comments:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to go to their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and play with gleaming eyes and play in the turtle you learn the day for day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguayan capital - on instruments derived from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reconstructed instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling process began to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez remembers a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the start time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a fact, which he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments from reconstructed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary named" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(harmonic garbage dump) distinguishes the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from Müll-zu-Musik around the world.</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Libyan waters before serving the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore upset and slightly inclined to welcome the criminals of this kind to their coasts.</seg>

<seg id="105">In the end it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the looting of the stocks of the country.</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to record. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm eco-ystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic obstacles, and also through the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions take place in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can share with each other for example lists existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open seas, by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are found in forbidden areas. such suspect routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the ships participating ships have a fanfare, where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse the assumption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships can not be sold to their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there is considerable financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company, who advocates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front door</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD to recover lost sales, which lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and to transfer active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this way a French native speaker should translate into French into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language, which can be translated into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for the overcoming, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, leave the company internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English language skills are considered the best, are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">The translation is only for help because we do not guarantee the accuracy of the contents.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrying and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translation demonstrate that this technique can't replace any human interpreter for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weird English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. but from large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more thorough translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully make a bigger source of its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in close proximity to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the "Plastic models of dishes") are issued by each food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>

<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burmesical words with basic meanings that have the same character as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese too 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (chamel), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarcaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboolish Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was extinguished today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>

<seg id="1323">Only even more hatred within the different communities will lead to tize such words.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "Erbsencurry" are banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found their mistake they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>

<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been reading article by Wikipedia, recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been adopted since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>

<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the Interplanetary File System), as the platform provided all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculators), which does not support the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and well-made colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to collaborate with the authorities to attain worldwide recognition of Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding of that wild animals are not so fearful as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he arose from face to face to face:</seg>

<seg id="1535">Only one or two still predict the name of her husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of the kidnapping of non-headed persons for organ trafficking, probably for declining purposes, dissettles the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Millier, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims has been found and a part of the organs were taken from.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and in consequence they were arrested by the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It gives the local superstition that the head of a black-headed man could bring gold or wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia declared the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on smooth-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN 2016 to investigate a mission in South Africa in order to investigate these practices.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Millier, where the assassinations were held.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the glamorous men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of glamorous individuals for obtaining and selling their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for probably abusive rituals, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generalize the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, who pointed out that the problem is part of the major social difficulty that Mosambik faces:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE A MOSAMBIK, THAT is ashamed of a country in which the people would have shame on the street, dressed as cheating them from the recordings of a portrait film, where the teachers would be ashamed to make sex against good marks, and others would not violate themselves or even their lives to get their bread, a country in which neither the albinos nor kahle or glamorous ones would be hunted down to get into fast riches.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state endangering) after the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will continue to avail calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him to permit a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are fully wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the fall of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should presume pressure to allow Liu abroad to make treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norwegen | QX GayMap</seg>

<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon crew to China, since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously disturbed, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release for expression and lud Liu to take his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his arrest, he was not able to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1647">On 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius as she spoke in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions on Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1654">The resignation of the US embassy drew up an angry response from China, with the exterior of the Foreign Ministry, that "no country has the right to intervene in unreasonable and irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple following the following:</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Welcome to Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blog osphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of a meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of the State New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people go to an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory injustice.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, where country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons were not very nobles: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, it seemed indefinitely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco and New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old suffering arises from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to her power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">"" "he said," "" "It is not a matter of fact," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point when he was paid up in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">When Anon publishes his comment on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should begin to read the entire presentation of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven important, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compares Singapore to cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said," "" "Be not a country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>

<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old garde, what awaits me - be I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it, and is aware of what he defended.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Southeast Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together to the Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today live for the largest part of the Russians and chases in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10.000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkueral.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district was 16,000 people after having barely reached over a decade.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink diamond frame and gold-colored earrings in Teddybären-Form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mom Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather she herself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 euros the night sleep guests in simple rooms, with bare, bumpy walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>

<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans are often traveling together and that Africans are talking about Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup World Championship.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he smiles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch again.</seg>
<seg id="2094">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has been one of them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaib's family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faced the conservative majority and asks her old-proven opinion about gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deal with topics such as Oriental alism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these themes will not only be found in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities committed by Damascus in Yemen to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"" "" "" "even if he doesn't open it openly, he gets a special cancellation against American foreign policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian poultry of the second generation" - so he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and never existed in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "Hdaib emphasizes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a person," "" "while he shakes in water solete Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sentimental hot Junitday has little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking, the perch of laurarian coffee and the sads of the Kent cigarette speak the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one raises a view into neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesman in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled "just because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many assert that the band's involvement in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be easy to seize rhetoric, but actually reflected a clear-crystallized reality in Jordan, which is clearly apparent in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib recovered traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have predominant sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently unfamiliar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, in Jordan, the number of "honour killings" has been released - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals reached its climax in 2016. however, the institutional infrastructure is still lacking in order to support women who were victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for interruption of the year 1954 women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can be held in prison, "and for their release it is often a long bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known for those who are not afraid of thematic themes that have long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib asserts that his work is politically, however, that he is not confined to his music, which is full of explicit experiences on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "I became a politician," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" ghareeb "" "" the focus is on poverty. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in the core of the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" "" "Santandano." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words, "that can get what you want," whether it is faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that barely anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbian, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn out of the context and had been censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but was only a machined version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighteenth century, who still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later able to work on behalf of the caliph in the eighteenth century, could be open to homosexuality, why can Jordanians do it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took several former government delegates and members of the educational association, with the reason they would have criticized on commentaries in social media, who are deeply rooted in the country rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant progress and taking. Jordan has denied a performance for the second time, but the progress of progress - it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, bedwardness and internal changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, even from an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be using music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, scatter-unitions and artificial species. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is, Hdaib becomes further raging and therefore resisting resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbers and illegal drugs are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual freshness of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led that more and more common citizens can go into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the dressage of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts in each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks like you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found a chance to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of getting bad advice to get a training in the hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Many young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel alienated, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la Reconiciación (letters to reconciliation), the young people are encouraged to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guerillabevegung FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signing of the treaty as so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were subjected to war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons in themselves must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear, and in some cases deepened deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now record their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly this did they also did: until now thousands of young people already wrote letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who should be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love to write thousands of love letters, but those who forget that they need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He continued to share his love with people who needed most urgent attention.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "" "" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse from a war history to a common history of peace," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">"" "" "" "I never thought that someone would forgive me" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were transferred to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to personally convey the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between," the politician student Manuela Jiménez Avila told her later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">"" "" "" "after we passed the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters." ""</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of refuge in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something." ""</seg>

<seg id="2211">"" "he said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter written by someone." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>

<seg id="2214">"" "" "" "I said," "" "Well, I'm not sure what you're talking about." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the needs of medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines are missing, which cover the particular medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a major impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lacking investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research that is carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2616">GM: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are many interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>

<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the motion for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used to permanently be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called shortly OSSI, US breeders may commit themselves to freely use the seeds used by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed. "open Source" breeders allow others to cross their seed to breed them, and it is not immediately disproporated - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects for the future</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI, Jack Kloppenburg has control over the seed and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed capital plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg states that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not deal with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," he says and takes on the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is offered in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"" "" "" "the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing their seed to others. this means that their action is to be patented in contrast to the seed and plant characteristics." ""</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available recovery pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, is shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one third of all the packaging characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which means that it is not usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat are still patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from such by which their taste or color improves to such, due to which they can thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties prove that the available plant material is abducted for breeders through ever more patents. genetic diversity is now more necessary than ever before, since the modified conditions caused by climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Sprecherin Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four gene banks and the co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company specialises in the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it does not contradict that intellectual property is other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties innovations." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not prevent innovations, but also promotes more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for a long time to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton bothered himself to patent plant features: "we do not create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. State Oregon and OSSI, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who is breeding a variety, also blows his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for which herbicides are needed, bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the sponsorship or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding grounds.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by avoiding plant patents more innovative: "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I always need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties for a few years," "" "he says." "" "with a patent it is protected from competition for 20 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seems to be a leader in the "Open Source" breed, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. the centre with farmers working together and helps them cultivate new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol is working on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for the breeds differ from country to country because the OSSI obligation does not simply take one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally planted plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch Organisation of Hivos held a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents of seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for" "" "Open Source" "" "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently establishing a global alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, which should be scheduled for the scheduled next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essens, has published a report published by McKnight Foundation and others - a report published by McKnight Foundation and others - it represents the view that farmers have the opportunity to share and improve seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Luby of OSSI hopes that it will soon recognize more people.</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still, the Egyptian authorities still unlock content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time, it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian Government closed the web site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about selections.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August published the Network an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for Human Rights Information remain bt- despite this attack and the constitution of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, which should actually defend the law, to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web pages for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnists and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for spreading columns and articles which he does not write to inaccessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog was built to deal with the Egyptian government's zensorship, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and took a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly revolves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed his blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to block is very old but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blog is not significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege; a arrest, a searchable murder, pre-charge of the national security council, the lock blogs and any other website I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First of all I used to handle items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go along the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the locking of providers through which Internet Census and private browsing was possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that offer VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue blocking content and filters to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worshiped by the fact that the decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by means of which they can proceed in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question is: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists not close our eyes in front of cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires, which grassed in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two and forty persons died and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of 15th and 16th October. this led to the fact that the government launched a state of State last week in solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires have also been registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and many villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, Pedrógão Grande suffered a similar tragedy, where 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded were wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burnt in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the serious situation: there are only in 4 districts no fire.</seg>

<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15th and 16th October, for residents information sought or tried to contact relatives, offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and became so crucial that the servers followed the storm of 400,000 users who followed the fires, not withholding the site: the website numbered more than half a million hits.</seg>
