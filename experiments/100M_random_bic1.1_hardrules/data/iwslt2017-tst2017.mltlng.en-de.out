they might know him because he won the Pu@@ lit@@ zer Prize as New York Times rep@@ orter .
for a long time before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA has heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this case , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us US intelligence operation in which the CIA has literally envel@@ op@@ ed Iran to a nuclear bomb .
if it sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not coinci@@ de with the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined cra@@ cks and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to judge W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Com@@ ple@@ tion , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot safegu@@ ard the identity of the mu@@ dd@@ les they can offer .
so when the government had arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ orters had already did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then just days before the process , something unusual happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they have been declar@@ ing that it is essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cra@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the rep@@ orters and sources can always hide themselves less .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
and so , the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are secret@@ ly concerned ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , finance and bank information , his credit loan , and even travel agents with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en supposed source to condem@@ n .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of her work as a secret .
since September 11th , almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitution , because the government has more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today there are communication software which has not yet been written as ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ medi@@ ation system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the past Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , as the Washington Post here .
here you can upload documents or send information , such as with any usual contact form .
this will then be encryp@@ ted and stored on a server that only has access to the respective news agency .
so the government cannot obtain more information secret@@ ly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the out@@ set .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology omin@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to get mis@@ set@@ . it &apos;s just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to report about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers and want to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the next environmental staff , the alarm to the contam@@ inated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to firms like Mos@@ ques Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland prime minister re@@ signed .
also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s mail@@ boxes are in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from childhood days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .

it seems to be we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens from some few are used to hide and wear their wealth -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pseu@@ dom@@ u@@ gil c@@ f. pas@@ kai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red neon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biot@@ op einrichten &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you have a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
pres@@ um@@ ably , because there were no prominent Americans who came in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we would have a data le@@ ck from Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states it needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed the employees of school districts to cover school children .

it is this kind of behaviour that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a conce@@ aled investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African Minister , who wanted to bring a susp@@ icious money to the USA in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked it all until a lawyer told our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all preliminary talks . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course none of them was handed over to them . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top polic@@ eman , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules .
we need to change the rules in order to make this kind of behaviour more difficult .
this may sound very anno@@ ying as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .

over the past few years we have seen more transparency , as regards the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US hin@@ ders here .
representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ visibility isn &apos;t good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ difference , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a day after I completed my design studies , I made an auction sale .
a type in the red head was stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was too late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake of asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what do I do now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know it first ! he says he would go for peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to escape in the trunk space of a dress !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ear , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sle@@ eps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , fri@@ ghtened to the door , and my sleeping room shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work which he bought from me depends on his class room . he now is teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view@@ point completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with .
let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ain@@ ly , my ro@@ omm@@ ate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think creativity can create it , transform fear into fun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Carl@@ son : &quot; Brian , I thought we could earn something to do . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can sleep with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ha ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we created a website and established such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress on a wooden floor .
they found it super , and we also .
I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham j@@ ams are completely different because we made them for our guests .
we went with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest , and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to create a site where people post the public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room that closes when you visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wa@@ ited that the mis@@ sile would light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but indeed they do not .
no one who is still at Tro@@ st would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ? why ?
because we all have lear@@ nt as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can see the things you can do well . we couldn &apos;t dis@@ close .
at the Academy Academy we learned that design is much more than just look and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who never met before .
can design make something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree we trust .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
keep thumb up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone to your left neighbour .
this quietly departure from panic , which you can now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the same mobile phone a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most of the guests feel at night when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
could you please tell us that he is candidate for the president of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some dis@@ cover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have imag@@ ined with his name ; if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine that you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that all say : &quot; he really can &apos;t hold very well ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to release your mobile phone ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are at age and residence .
a little surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social in@@ coher@@ ence .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also learned that trust is dependent on how much they are in@@ expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you say too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ ju@@ dice against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the shop is very good for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were unable to celebrate parties or des@@ olate apartments .
the hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at front of the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that one list@@ ens to the voice of the c@@ aller and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
luck@@ ily , only a fra@@ ction had only a fra@@ ction of 123 million overnight stays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for men have trusted one another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if confidence is functioning , it can arise won@@ dro@@ us .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him into hospital .
he even don@@ ated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to take heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .

you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can only recommend it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so naturally does not run any stay .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of part@@ ing together with money transactions ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is simply called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the matter is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;

nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if we would create flats from the ground ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would that look like ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of soli@@ tude and isolation .
in the South Korean capital of Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking places which the government belonged .
students who were searching for a pencil , were now offered .
were given to people whose children were de@@ duc@@ ted . inc@@ ub@@ ators programs were launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest with a stranger or even host .
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we didn &apos;t have invented the bike .
hospitality was already already in advance .
there were already similar sites in front of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so why did our work work ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from lucky and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that is amazing , &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about it when a red head is driving past me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence I ask myself what we can use in the future .

a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not just my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a susp@@ ect .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how I went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I fear@@ ed the first time to be recognized as Musli@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blei@@ bt in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were intelli@@ gible , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people speaking for Muslims in the free cr@@ um@@ ble and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
I have cri@@ tici@@ zed the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to hide Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
there is only question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you very much !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , acade@@ mics and Olymp@@ us .
will the closure of mos@@ ques become safer ?
there will probably be a few parking places , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to consider people to be toler@@ ant to others , and to show greater citizen participation .
and like me a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alized in their basement or in bed before a computer .
in the radi@@ alization process , one has noticed that it starts online . as a first person , the person is cut off from her community , even from her family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ates their behaviour and ideology is a betra@@ yal or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a non@@ violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establish@@ es its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Musli@@ ma , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you very much !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups asser@@ t their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one looks at her , she does not drive what she read in her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in writing .
an outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought silence and told her that her anger , her sense of inj@@ us@@ tice in the world , would only bring it in trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing is inspired and something that has been given to their anger , it was a major goal for instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that you promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Imam established the connection with God and their church .
instead of blame for their rage , he showed its con@@ structive ways for a real change in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept them to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an authorit@@ arian governmental system , con@@ formity and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study reveals : if one has been reported to test persons in which negative about Muslims was reported , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims up@@ set -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraqi war and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction of Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to ste@@ al the foundation of a free society , that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the way of dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear does not harm us all .
for the assignment of collective debt , it is not just about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chap@@ el Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was talented at the denti@@ st Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous man who knew her .
she attended him there and he showed her life . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a young man born out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne near her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after having posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .

fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
we went to the mos@@ que or stayed safe at home ?
we pra@@ yed it and for us it was not easy to decide which America we want to give to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , moved my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was holding me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Imam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and was welcomed by our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a ner@@ v .
but I ask myself , what do you say those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a vision@@ ary with drau@@ ght are working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , want people to normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
if people like an exception are usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists began to become a billion @-@ billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial Dro@@ h@@ nen . it is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air transport in our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six metre high tower of 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flights , flight controllers reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build resi@@ li@@ ence stress @-@ load@@ able structures .
they have lear@@ nt to wear loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react in general on natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the furniture in the autonomous flight .
in order that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collec@@ tively aware of where the mobile objects are located in space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board , what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; External commands exist at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called hed@@ geho@@ g starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters it is efficient , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and thus has rough advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 2,@@ 0@@ 84 173
a restri@@ ction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ ises .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2
during our research we are often confronted with fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for the answer to such a question .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts , which are accum@@ ulated in order to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , the pil@@ ots were able to fly remot@@ ely controlled aircraft that had only two mo@@ vable parts : a propeller and a stern ru@@ dder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discovered that flies with only one work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a mo@@ vable part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move around in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it correctly .
the probability of throwing it right is low , so I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ els is an exercise in genius , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess flow .
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that it is not only symmet@@ rical .
this is why he is ambi@@ valent in its direction .
in this way , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest is lear@@ nt directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
if flight machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two propeller @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this turns clo@@ ck@@ wise in clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
if you assemble them , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ copter .
if there is something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now demonstrate this by making one half of fli@@ ght@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we received commerci@@ ally micro @-@ Quad@@ copter -- each single weigh@@ s less than a disc of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
a flying lamp@@ shade would be a particularly reliable machine on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage is in the development and the creation act .
it serves as a remin@@ der of how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the i .
thank you very much .
in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y two black holes revol@@ ve in a very far distant gal@@ ax@@ y , they turned out so the mass of three prob@@ es in a tenth of second in pure energy .
for this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies throughout the universe .
it was a very big bang .
however , their energy did not put it in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time feeling itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s arrange the events at a time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell lives were created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stands at -- even the Internet .
approximately 25 years ago , a group of especially Mu@@ eller -- R@@ ai Weiss , from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but enough people recognize them as crazy gen@@ ies so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector li@@ go : laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of li@@ go could be considerably increased , which improved the recognition performance tremend@@ ously .
this is why it is called Advanced li@@ go .
at the beginning of September 2015 , li@@ go was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes through the earth .
you went through you and me
and also through the detector .

the Birth of my Dau@@ ghter
and the good@@ bye to my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically , this was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theore@@ tic physi@@ c@@ ist on MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories such as li@@ go mess@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a stimul@@ us in the feeling of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
for illu@@ stra@@ tive , lectur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a proper al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ amped by us during the meeting of the waves . the expansion of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the li@@ go employees for mad .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is absur@@ d , this length would have to be measured less than a thous@@ and@@ th of an atomic nucle@@ us exactly . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite convenient , because you can create a picture or map of things by taking the light around you from several points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly useful to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is breaking it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ ummer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in the universe .
but by looking at changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , for li@@ go the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us much about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , which is my colleague Scott already busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just like : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same p@@ ups with an additional ton@@ ic change . that sounds like : W@@ u wu Yi@@ wu Yi@@ wu Yi@@ wu Yi@@ wu .
it is a kind of movement sensor , embos@@ sed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard the following : &#91; sur@@ rendering noise &#93; J@@ someone who knows what he needs to hear , this det@@ ects as noise from -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass that turns around as quickly as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , moves one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fantastic . fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of li@@ go .
li@@ go p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it never was possible before .
on this way , we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
much in all we can do -- practically or fundament@@ ally -- not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through this op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the urine is covered by its own tail@@ lights .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we never saw never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , it took place in the first start of the start of things we did not expect .
my colleague am MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the li@@ go project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes how li@@ go them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ rian no@@ bles for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
li@@ go allows us to create a completely different view@@ point on the events in the universe , on the emergence of stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to li@@ go we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and p@@ ups of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in the universe .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the pri@@ esth@@ ood ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year , I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fear@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it made me nervous about me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to speak to the public ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do that which I fear@@ ed , my fear was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear of keeping spe@@ eches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected . it started with a question of my young@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cookies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I wa@@ ited to always play with them as soon as you notice me . no matter what I do , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I try it very .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children to save my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things are aw@@ aken to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created TV . I have produced TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;

each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finding Carter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : Trailer zu Staffel 2B ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes , which at the same time in production , four , 16 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get Away With Murder , 10 epis@@ odes : the Catch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run on Thursday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ent . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hour TV , three , sometimes four shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world .
do you know who this is doing ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard whether you are running a company , a country or a class room , take a business or a household to take me seriously when I speak of work so that you can understand that I &apos;m not just lying on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it is true when I say : I understand that it is not about dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so as if you dream a high tone , deliver a marathon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , st@@ ress@@ ful and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and politically , cru@@ el and rational . and the best thing about it is the sum .
there is so a change in me when working well .
a sum@@ mer@@ time starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it .
many people take when I explain them the sum@@ s that I talk about writing that writing me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the Sum@@ men is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ mer@@ time is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t be different than after size .
feeling not different than stri@@ ving for size , no matter what price .
this is what you call the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ a@@ holic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@
maybe it is ego .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for shit , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more epis@@ odes , the more over@@ crowded borders , the more work there is , the more things get closer to me , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more I write history .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned out .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single working class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ bs , I want to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine mu@@ te .
I loved my work no more . the engine was .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked week@@ ends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not sleeping , there is not , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sw@@ ap .
in me still@@ ness was still@@ ness .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a pre @-@ show @-@ titanium ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men I was .
so what do you do when what you do is the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heu@@ l dich aus , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , one loves what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves another one , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; DRAGON Ball Z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super Gok@@ u Den 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eng &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way home , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no , than two things are aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not called me &quot; cookies . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
I missed it when I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ p , I can do nothing .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the land which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pins and the song in which it goes loose , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin &quot; is released .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens up and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s slowly come back .
no full volume , hardly da , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s but a sum@@ ming .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let us stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we forgot to forget .
the sum@@ s , the working sum@@ s , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m telling me by means of Shows and TV hours , and how working my brain is , then I have forgotten what is the real sum .
the sum@@ s are no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the current that comes from the loss of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum@@ s ign@@ ores the pressure of the history , the most enlighten@@ ing tasks , the expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot;
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so I can release myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any blame .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am rather at work at work as home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
now yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ras@@ im in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always get to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the Universe comp@@ lies with me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever heard of playing games ?
you can also ! tell them Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not bad or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they think they want something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks replaces me .
and speak my teen@@ ie daughter for about 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs it .
everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no de@@ fle@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to spend .

my children are my fav@@ ours , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about games with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have a look at the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in my training when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a couple of months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men is not I ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is my sum . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s me that I am a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan before playing the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire burn still .
the more I play , the more fortunate I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country which I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , stunning , bare and new feeling of life in me wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I aw@@ ake you to life .
that belongs to the job that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neurolog@@ ist .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after an accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe dis@@ ability .
this is probably the reason why I was a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
they are sure they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; implant@@ ing a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s , which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
often , I provided patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that the brain is sw@@ elling in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a and increases the skull pressure .
in order to save life , the pressure must be reduced .
sometimes a part s@@ wollen brain mass has to be removed .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean with that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a piece of tissue , it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he looked at his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ? why ?
it looks exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you know still from the biology study that stem cells are un@@ rip@@ e cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they took part slowly and after a few weeks they died even .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ Sum@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eals .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the f@@ etus , they provide the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they will take part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concent@@ rations near brain injuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that allows cer@@ eb@@ ral healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then mark color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the disposal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with mon@@ keys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we were inf@@ erior to and irrit@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells were obtained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course , we couldn &apos;t stop here .
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained ap@@ es with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we spent the motor mot@@ orized field in the motor@@ ised Cort@@ ex .
then the mon@@ keys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
exactly as it would happen with people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms .
as we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation .
I can tell you , these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Par@@ kinson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely recommend .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill up two kilogra@@ ms of paper and forms to pass this type of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it lasts until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us to launch it soon ?
then one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply that to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy . democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant they are in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable ge@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe capitalism leads inevitably to democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neigh@@ bor in Beijing have proved that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and an impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , democracy is f@@ ading in us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek Government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous to me as a finance minister in the euro@@ group -- our elections -- not to influence austerity programs which were realized in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sinc@@ ere friends who told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh what would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group in a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are gem@@ s , our future glo@@ ster and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed .
on the topic of waste , I would like to point to an interesting disc@@ rep@@ ancy that is currently threatened by our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the tut@@ or that th@@ rows his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all know the tor@@ so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the assets and corporations , which , however , are too scar@@ ed to invest it , where it would be productive and in@@ expensive , with which one could carry out the school denberg and also produce all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen us invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so forth .
3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen US dollars sounds a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollar , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the common market mechanisms .
the result is st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that advoc@@ ates the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . exactly as E@@ di@@ pus father , who is out of fear , the proph@@ ecy of the Iraqi could be true that his son would kill him when he will grow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I mean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is my hate with capitalism -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
its extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy , of course , too many of -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the ath@@ etic democracy due to this exclusion .
the decision @-@ making on the ath@@ etic democracy was and is that they entered the working arms and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they give them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal vote of voting in questions of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not kept for a long time -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that sh@@ ines very light , it is also quickly burned .
however , our current liberal democra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ etic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was confin@@ ed to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a more democratic zone .
in our present democra@@ cies , since the time , this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , gradually mer@@ ging the economy and escap@@ es it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because it can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because power from politics to the economy is diver@@ ted and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hate with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s about such a flock of pre@@ dat@@ ors that are so sustain@@ ably the animals they are fed , dec@@ im@@ ated , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy that has been so far from politics that it has been har@@ med by the self @-@ induced economic crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of corporations increases , political goods are exploited , political goods are being exploited , economic demand falls , and the company &apos;s directors are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more successful capitalism drive the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politicians and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; ret@@ ains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage labour by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of the waste , and the social conflicts lower , as it seems -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and ensure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we are in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which let the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; which is similar to the &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in which machines are used , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations with the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what could it look like to have these &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to call you , in all brief , some examples .
in the area of the company , please provide a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital is working for you next , from a company to the next one , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income derived from capital and of income and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein , and employees who work there , but not a de@@ duction between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no longer t@@ wins between capital and labour .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that you did not have the technical resources at that time .
today we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united policy and economy .
the world which I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally in which they preferred privileged individuals , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opie ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you .

you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... T@@ un we don &apos;t think that technological development will create a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers are referred to as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is thoroughly relevant .
as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you hold from the West &apos;s vision to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the impression of democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of the economy is playing -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some resp@@ ects , if I may say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remind -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically viewed .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly sc@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what to be observed in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now to do that which the West has done in the nin@@ ete@@ enth century , is huge to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that comes .
Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Friday , 23 May
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot; &quot; &quot;
to adopt us from compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive transformation line was proce@@ eding through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massive under the development of the whole European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion , which revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the euro area , are still elected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system which is not able to get out of life by political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , it will be possible for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed it was an honest interest on behalf of the investors to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they only wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the ver@@ d@@ ations that were going through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a dis@@ astro@@ us program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , who imposed us this policy , stood up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the Eurozone doesn &apos;t survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they don &apos;t survive , the exposed tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not alone for Europe &apos;s dis@@ astro@@ us consequences , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to step up the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .

Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must find shows that are very very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the web site . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
will your show be weigh@@ ted with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive where after one has swal@@ lowed a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where is there any more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this type of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what goes off at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not want to get into the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to teach &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .

you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process these and from it , the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
do someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super @-@ show and he uses data for it but it makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they show will show the shows they like , etc .
then use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which actor ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know this show ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so , exactly where they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what &apos;s happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data diversi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can optim@@ ise it with a very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is a good TV , or ?
if data analysis does not work , this is something fri@@ ghtening , because we live in a time in which we live more and more about statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
do someone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this space will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , are you in jail .
if someone is in prison here in prison and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismis@@ sal is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always creates the best results . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .

it worked wonderful and was a great news compensation . the success poison@@ ed in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year round year around year , until it did not work anymore ,
and nobody could tell why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in spite of all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you are doing two things :
as a first , dis@@ solve this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the parts together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and assemble .
and now the important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to res@@ ume the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we own it all : our brain .
if there is something where the brain is good , parts and pieces can be res@@ umed , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong to the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
they used data to control all their decisions first when they show TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and in order to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question , you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should hear the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more fra@@ c@@ tured , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it is important to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data you still pay off , make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
