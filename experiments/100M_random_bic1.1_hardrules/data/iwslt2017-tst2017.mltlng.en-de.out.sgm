<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">For a long time before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA has heard illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this case, he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA has literally enveloped Iran to a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not coincide with the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined cracks and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government to judge Whistleblower and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Completion, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot safeguard the identity of the muddles they can offer.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government had arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they have been declaring that it is essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Originaltitel: law & Order: special Victims Unit (TV)</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigators, without his consent, are secretly concerned,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, finance and bank information, his credit loan, and even travel agents with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risen supposed source to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of her work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11th, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitution, because the government has more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software which has not yet been written as risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmediation system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the past Aaron Swartz, and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">Here you can upload documents or send information, such as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will then be encrypted and stored on a server that only has access to the respective news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology ominators such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to get misset. it's just as important that we protect the next whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "who wants to report about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers and want to report from overcrowded hospitals." "" "or the next environmental staff, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider warned us before the next financial crisis." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leck of the history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [we asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness to an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to firms like Mosques Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's mailboxes are in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from childhood days, a famous cellists." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be weeping away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "why should we go?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens from some few are used to hide and wear their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "Pseudomugil cf. paskai" "" "red neon" "" "Biotop einrichten" ""</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there were no prominent Americans who came in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we would have a data leck from Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states it needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed the employees of school districts to cover school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Firm of the Year for Trademarks and Unfair Competition Harmsen Utescher Firm of the Year for M & A Noerr Firm of the Year for Media</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a concealed investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African Minister, who wanted to bring a suspicious money to the USA in order to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked it all until a lawyer told our investigator how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preliminary talks. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course none of them was handed over to them. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer, who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top policeman, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to make this kind of behaviour more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very annoying as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen more transparency, as regards the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US hinders here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy that stand up and say," "" "Invisibility isn't good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the indifference, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>

<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plainly, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>

<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Carlson: "Brian, I thought we could earn something to do. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can sleep with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">"" "Ha!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established such "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure, our cheese ham jams are completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We went with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest, and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>

<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They are sure they have heard of one of the most known, the "deep-brain stimulation." implanting a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's, which suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>

<seg id="813">Often, I provided patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain is swelling in skull-brain traumata and increases the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, the pressure must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes a part swollen brain mass has to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean with that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a piece of tissue, it is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looks exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know still from the biology study that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They took part slowly and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called DoubleSumtin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cereals.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus, they provide the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they will take part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that allows cerebral healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the disposal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we were inferior to and irritated exactly the same cells and now the cells were obtained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course, we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we spent the motor motorized field in the motorised Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="872">As we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill up two kilograms of paper and forms to pass this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it lasts until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply that to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>

<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>

<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>

<seg id="908">"" "" "" "indeed, democracy is fading in us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek Government -- was unambiguous to me as a finance minister in the eurogroup -- our elections -- not to influence austerity programs which were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would abolish what would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup in a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are gems, our future gloster and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point to an interesting discrepancy that is currently threatened by our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin" "" "paradox." ""</seg>

<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 Billionen us invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billionen US dollars sounds a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollar, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the common market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that advocates the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest. exactly as Edipus father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the Iraqi could be true that his son would kill him when he will grow.</seg>

<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"" "" "" "the athenic democracy, of course, too many of --" ""</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the athetic democracy due to this exclusion.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision-making on the athetic democracy was and is that they entered the working arms and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they give them the right to political co-determination with equal vote of voting in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the athenic democracy has not kept for a long time --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very light, it is also quickly burned.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athetic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was confined to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time, this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, gradually merging the economy and escapes it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because power from politics to the economy is diverted and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hate with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's about such a flock of predators that are so sustainably the animals they are fed, decimated, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy that has been so far from politics that it has been harmed by the self-induced economic crisis." "" "the power of corporations increases, political goods are exploited, political goods are being exploited, economic demand falls, and the company's directors are too scared to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drive the "Demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politicians and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage labour by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of the waste, and the social conflicts lower, as it seems -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we have to reunite the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we are in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which let the film" matrix "appear like a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">"" "" "" "the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth." ""</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystopia, similar to the "Matrix," which is similar to the "Star Trek," in which machines are used, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations with the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what could it look like to have these" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia rather than the" Matrix "" "" similar dystopia? "" "</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to call you, in all brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company, please provide a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital is working for you next, from a company to the next one, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and of income and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein, and employees who work there, but not a deduction between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no longer twins between capital and labour.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded -- we call it" "" "Cosmos" "", "in units of" Cosmos "" "" and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund. "" "</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you did not have the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunited policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world which I describe you is at the same time liberally in which they preferred privileged individuals, and marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the Mülleimer of history, and keynesianically, globally keynesianically.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "Matrix" "" "- similar dystopie?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has plazed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super-show and he uses data for it but it makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team have watched the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they show will show the shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which actor?</seg>
<seg id="1076">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "Marcia Cross in" "" "Quantico" "" "(Spoiler) 06.11.2015 | Vampire Diaries" ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so, exactly where they wanted." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what's happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimise it with a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is a good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, this is something frightening, because we live in a time in which we live more and more about statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Do someone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this space will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch, are you in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in prison and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. this is not because a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict eradication of influenza, the worse kind, predictions, by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news compensation. the success poisoned in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round year around year, until it did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could tell why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you are doing two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, dissolve this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the parts together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and assemble.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to resume the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we own it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something where the brain is good, parts and pieces can be resumed, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions first when they show TV ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "That's the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and in order to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should hear the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more fractured, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it is important to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data you still pay off, make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
