sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small farmers cultiv@@ ate the former cause of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories for days .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone who had to get exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green me@@ adow instead of a circum@@ navigation road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are all other than current - but are therefore very short @-@ sigh@@ ted .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a carpet @-@ carpet , which is not immediately recogni@@ z@@ able as such .
for cities and communities , detailed maps were incorporated into the large picture postcard , so @-@ called urine @-@ sheets .
these were created according to the data of the Bavarian Palace Department between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and arises from Bavaria &apos;s first survey@@ ing .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ Guide occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War , with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied land and ordered a top@@ ographic record of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops were ab@@ duc@@ ted with the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighb@@ ors who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bayern @-@ map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Palace Department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flyer for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library website .
the comparison of the former / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , there is nothing to see than fields - at first sight : a small @-@ piece card with dirty lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ries from the so @-@ called &quot; urine sample &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small pit@@ ches do not show farmers more - but small nur@@ ser@@ y of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a me@@ adow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads only the street name &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; or at the height of &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one was able to stop people with mad@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ Munich @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; was created .
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard from Gu@@ dden led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought to death by King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the chains of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he has said to the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 280 patients , it was first place , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Clinic Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s biggest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .

the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the T@@ SV Munich Ost , east residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built in architectural reference to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in Bom@@ ben@@ attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke many holes in the downtown of 1944 in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages were once again at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn trail .
with the sliders you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .

the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force until August 28 , 2017 calls af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based attacks occur in the entire state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to attract victims of discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , who aim to release travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have injuries of civil rights that happen to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chap@@ el , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group c@@ ited cases like rac@@ ist abuse against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state , and was taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i in cust@@ ody without being accused of being accused .
the Council also points to a recently published report of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black car drivers will be able to hold 75 percent more frequently than the White .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chap@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring the money or the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report of the FBI , who entered the state in relation to the number of such violations at the 16th rank of the country .
the identification of the regional determin@@ ants of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) location is an important regional policy issue as FDI is supposed to improve the labour market conditions of the host region .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states agreed immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration restrictions , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ LU for further road profil@@ ing .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times interest groups have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .

Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann initially grant insights into his farm in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of its cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste , only region@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the crossover project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot profit@@ ably manage such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; care for a lot of work , much need to be mach@@ ined with the sense of the engine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ demann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ event@@ h operation and took this without chemical pestici@@ des and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead a bi@@ ob@@ et@@ ype .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the significance of the crossover project and is glad about leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the settlement of the surfaces could be dra@@ fted for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
the retention area is 40 hectares , which must not be kept up until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus , the farmers were 12 610 Euros , which had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ demann commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you make a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss stand firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ sp@@ fle@@ dged Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ el f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the enclosed area may not be tra@@ pper@@ able ( slope over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the invitation .
for the Fischer@@ bacher crossover project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence around 16 kilometres .
the retention area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?

the saf@@ est notes of a regime change is when they begin to attack the stat@@ ues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the sor@@ row@@ ed over@@ throw Sadd@@ am Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to dras@@ tically restri@@ ct the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller &apos;s handle doesn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have been g@@ yn@@ ned if he had done it .
but he took their meaning , and especially the meaning that you were written when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) 06.11.2015 &#124; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem on which you relate to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is right , but as he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance of Laz@@ arus , the only one in which a state does not only load any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your fatigue , your arms , and your op@@ pressed masses , who have lon@@ ging to breathe freely , and the el@@ event@@ ful waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving litter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confront@@ ation : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by presenting the female embo@@ diment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly how Laz@@ arus changed the significance of the statue , the people wanted to change this for a long time from the right wing .
the great Schrei@@ h@@ als Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not one of them , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring American flame to the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proce@@ eding .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is completely and at all a question of standing point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative action of Laz@@ arus was to see them as it was seen from the exhau@@ sted , el@@ event@@ h , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble jour@@ neys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ ung@@ es Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two fle@@ ets belonged to the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish ath@@ l@@ ete think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are Med@@ ail@@ len candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew BOO@@ T@@ CH@@ ART - fought against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was unbeliev@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h spent quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al Winner , which will compete with its fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland has so far been the best total number of athletes in the world championship seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
in the past year , the middle @-@ hau@@ l Mu@@ ir cros@@ ses five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another gr@@ otto that one should watch for a great season , which one should watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .

the team @-@ captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men do not only belong to the team , but also in some cases also with med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about Team Captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor , but to know that my team@@ mates have voted for me and voted for something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the fle@@ ets that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is my speech as captain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , I think it was good .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hog@@ an &apos;s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an Lov@@ ells Firm of the Year for Restru@@ c@@ turing and Corporate Rescue
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and to de@@ duct his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy at his side .
it is therefore the blocking of persons who come to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum , which is considered official and paid by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Hog@@ an &apos;s spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the acts of govern@@ or and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of t@@ rolls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ opping @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate the whi@@ p line online .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no comfort .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest zi@@ pped the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Hog@@ an Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same subject , then they are respected by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employee of govern@@ or referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

that should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers were multip@@ lied by between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck up their leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous consol@@ ation .

Ron@@ an Raff@@ ert@@ y hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ ert@@ y will hope in the next three days on domestic convenience , since the ren@@ aissance club in East Lot@@ hian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led next year in Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambass@@ ad@@ ors in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ ert@@ y said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is an ei@@ fri@@ ent author of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship , although he won the European Challenge Tour at the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have won &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken out of the program during the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we &apos;ll always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Open this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it good , but you sense this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad about how it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty .

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic of 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex

in the area of domestic connections , the location is more complicated than anticipated because the underground has a lot of vineyards , which is not notic@@ eable in the plans .
the traffic , which is continually ob@@ struct@@ ed the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .

poverty and death in Indon@@ esian gold land
when B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she uses no stove .
they even rarely use a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ele in the in@@ sec@@ lu@@ ded Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as a &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the fo@@ iled tu@@ ber is removed with freezing , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floors - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a dach@@ less space serves as a lat@@ rine .
the most recent of the four wives of her husband were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there is the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock in the village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch col@@ ony that was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , than only 1,0@@ 26 elders who were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red for the independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly to the government of Jak@@ arta to keep control over the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal representatives .
in 2003 , the province was officially split in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour driving with car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ f@@ ishes , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roof@@ s , which were converted by rust into different yellow brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans became a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her vibrant , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mort@@ ality and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an of Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provin@@ cial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort built gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of 78 billion US dollars in the value of the estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has a sti@@ cking presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ .000 US dollars in a single officer .
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden streets and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprison@@ ed .
according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as were to commit genocide .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peac@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers in the past year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - ra@@ pe and dis@@ cover@@ ies are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian president J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to address in@@ equ@@ alities and inf@@ rin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann granted 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have agreed to J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took off@@ ence at their sound and later came back with four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk and swal@@ lowed the group with their guns , said to victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch before the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial h@@ unters and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird @-@ singing - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ fourth of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , on the por@@ ch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin were witness to the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes told how many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TIME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief insp@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told rep@@ orters that his officers were only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they would be attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings came first on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to go to the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Law@@ anto said in October 2016 to implement an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the laying of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the nin@@ ete@@ enth and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all legally regulated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claimed that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such asser@@ tions with fier@@ ce dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ o@@ bus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the army sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a non@@ ru@@ h@@ eh@@ ement for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claim@@ ing to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by encounter@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
in recent years , thousands of people were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some dive never again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tra@@ gic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work in four or five fields of sweet potato .
they reserve the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic in@@ equ@@ alities have grown between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived at Nab@@ ire airport since the opening of new flight routes .
the few jobs that there are in the region usually go to the better educated and wealth@@ y migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , restrictions on media coverage remain ten@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Escu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were dep@@ orted for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission of the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to lift up transparency and development were not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indon@@ esi@@ ens &apos;s un@@ even eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press controls means that international pressure to the Indon@@ esian government remains largely confin@@ ed to the immediate neigh@@ bours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March ur@@ ged six pa@@ zi@@ ish States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai fo@@ undry .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian foreign ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambass@@ ador , K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , visited her silence and ur@@ ged him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the permanent threat of a rob@@ ber@@ y military , is located in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for J@@ ok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they want just justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot sacrific@@ ed a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in an area against the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes .

a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest dor@@ mit@@ ories of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire , who swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ rise building , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sle@@ pt and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ ams of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told an inhabit@@ ant who attacked his name as George Bush , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 pm local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident may ask questions about the safety of materials that are used in external areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of panels for isolation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire in which 80 people died .

it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those who are most often flying .
however , the company suggests that T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain which liquids can take them with or how much it is .

in doing so , he has under@@ gone that a part of the customer has res@@ cu@@ ed their non @-@ binding reservation already .
in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures to increase in sales and even more gig@@ antic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ Head El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less da@@ zz@@ ling number : the canc@@ ell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery starts right now .

critics always pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservation .
in case of canc@@ ell@@ ations Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment . &quot;
at present , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k vac@@ ant at a telephone conference with analysts .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ .000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 should be - all models come together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , at the moment of 1800 bookings are made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never ever tested in practice @-@ tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger del@@ ays , the liability of the reservations may be the problem for Tes@@ la .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers to run away in scar@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a day after he was indi@@ cted from 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the environmental protection authority , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities to be more respon@@ sive than previous administration .
he does not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Employment Law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about a deadline scheduled on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for the ground @-@ approaching o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State Prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent against environmental protection legislation .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been repeated to block or delay regul@@ ating the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
last month , a Federal occupation court in Washington decided that the EP@@ A administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in an opinion published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of the EP@@ A to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administration , the EP@@ A often did not comply with dead@@ lines for the implementation and then indi@@ cted by activists and others , and in an agreement to establish the date for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained to the EP@@ A more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority which we are giving us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EP@@ A statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ sign@@ ment of the o@@ zone rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a draft bill approved in the last month is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini acc@@ entu@@ ates : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wür@@ ttem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen , with the Vog@@ t@@ ei &quot; an Mag@@ ister Eberhard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
the wording of the document was based on the Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the former parish church , also a magnificent court , which belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron saint and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , in addition to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 present these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron saint was origin@@ ated from the early medieval Eig@@ enkir@@ che .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church .
this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new past@@ or to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two pieces at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell gave the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops moved near the church .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal requirements for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( CDU ) to take its approval for the construction of planned wind turbin@@ es in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association argued that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbin@@ es could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal exist a wind @-@ force concentration zone exists .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbin@@ es are possible at the same time , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .

the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , but the district government of Düsseldorf was not approved , due to a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the approval of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a hom@@ olog@@ ation of the District Government still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the division of approval for the construction of wind turbin@@ es is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Schrei@@ e torn the silence as a young black man was dist@@ orted from the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this terrible scene was played on July 22 , only one post@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everybody was very real sigh@@ s in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil law@@ makers have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were g@@ yn@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indi@@ cted for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable that in all these years no single person was arrested , although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in the organization of post@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want to reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court medi@@ ator puts a blan@@ ket on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ chen on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , which were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none has ever been indi@@ cted .
although the susp@@ ects remain free on foot since decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the decision of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to put their vote on the pres@@ election campaign in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had sle@@ pt with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she wore , did not stem from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her C@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the Mor@@ de , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a con@@ spiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , rep@@ lic@@ ated evidence and dec@@ eived the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a right @-@ wing mass@@ acre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register yourself and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re@@ location of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .

it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the al@@ ness in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide killed two people killed near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of N@@ ato , the explosion on Thursday evening was to be done , as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displac@@ ed explosive device &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and will be treated in the U.S. military hospital at the B@@ agram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of Taliban and the group , is known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city has killed more than 150 people with the most fatal military attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban away from power .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is weak@@ ening the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EP@@ A Boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to reg@@ ain a wide range of environmental impacts , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .

the establishment of a common space would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .

Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking to the common room - but absolutely against a communist participation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like a conce@@ aled sub@@ vention of already wealth@@ y or even foreign investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no surplus , but will receive a real one , in the case of doubt , is the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will emerge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
a plan@@ etary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the needs of many har@@ lot visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , exercise and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place boards along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans to plan well accessible installations at five to six locations in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in question , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network is playing a role in the selection of location choice .
acces@@ sibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad , viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not sure where you &apos;re getting your information , but great topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2014 , the association has been running in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest @-@ altitude observ@@ atory of Northern Germany since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Con@@ servation , the site in the midst of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ m@@ eda Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni town since 2003 , there have been something similar to the planned Stern@@ en@@ wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s plan@@ etary path since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the plan@@ etary path cros@@ ses up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extraordinary &quot; site in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ el@@ es with the individual plan@@ ets - including the degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , which measures 70 cen@@ timet@@ ers .
the entire length of the planet path is approximately four kilometres .
while the light from sun up to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fix , however , would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia who should stand in a colli@@ sion course in order to stage the most exciting pit in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in E@@ SP@@ N offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ disturbed World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight weight champion , down the corri@@ dor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super spring weight champion .
according to Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by un@@ anim@@ ous decision on the former four divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ ner on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on E@@ SP@@ N .
as the pair for photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I would like to come down to lightweight weight .
and he has to move on lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@
&quot; &quot; &quot; let us give them this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed to vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes need this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate change asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year in order to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date for the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ by @-@ View mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whenever they are ready ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he sets Lom@@ ach@@ enko as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko kept his generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show stro@@ kes , then boxing .
both said they could sense the moment that built themselves for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an accident on the A7 , four people were injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost its control over his vehicle shortly before the junction of the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car pulled down right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ took it and then on the roof in the green strip remained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were sever@@ ely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 motorway was closed towards the north for approximately one hour , then traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident station .

firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
with the first start of the season , Andre Hoffmann had been pleased with the result , as not the two oppos@@ ites had been in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erzgebirge , the three chain should also be optimized further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is able to achieve better after the experience in preparation with the three chain , than with the four chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still I don &apos;t know how we operate in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we are just in the three chain on half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ elmann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , but that we do not harmon@@ ize and we do not do so many game mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you can speak of a mis@@ er@@ able start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could definitely be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are standing on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly be able to speak of a great season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start in the season was only after six to eight games , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an un@@ w@@ et@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fresh as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against Ascen@@ sion fav@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 percent where they are standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is n@@ n@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundesliga you need to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas &apos;s chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet such a statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t and arro@@ gan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 per cent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Agency for For@@ ens@@ atory Medicine ( Council medic@@ in@@ als ) has begun with the execution of tests last year .

until today , Migration cl@@ amps have been sent to testing cases and the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steady over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person searched for 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det studied the 5@@ 81 results , she realized that in 243 these cases the person had openly told that she would be 18 years old .
the method of the medical assessment , in which X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and M@@ RT recordings are made of knee joints , which then be analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tic is the Endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether it was earlier or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do so as if we could &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is unlikely to judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .

the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete that is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .

in order to ensure stability and safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly san@@ iti@@ zed .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now got a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as a operation .
at the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .

Af@@ D in Ger@@ olstein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to bring under a hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ steiner Stadthalle Rond@@ ell invites the campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great electoral campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which forms the top @-@ end duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the dep@@ uty president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event will not want to listen to the amateur enthusiasts , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , the city pic@@ nic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table , &quot; on the fountain of the fountain , but it is now on the parking place below the Rond@@ elle - and therefore right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful picture that offers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A World and one of the major organizers , really rejo@@ ice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police closed many civil servants after Ger@@ ol@@ steiner , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ steiner ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel reported , he stri@@ ves to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the Rond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes rejo@@ ices that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D president Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their spe@@ eches .
the police presence , however , remained unchanged until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the playground have a longer breath , but also there is to be cancelled shortly after 21 : 00 .

West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ cr@@ ats removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you many prayers and many re@@ membran@@ ce ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic gover@@ ment . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notify me of follow @-@ up comments by email . notify me of new posts by email .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , has been elected 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states , and inher@@ ited a carbon business by his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can Party committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather hin@@ der us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , united message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday what he described as an off@@ ending exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed to the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ine said during the I@@ A@@ AF congress on the eve of athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships , that the ex@@ ile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been caught by cont@@ ests of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ AF congress approved for the maintenance of the ban , which was suspended in November 2015 , after a report of the World @-@ Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ADA ) had found evidence of state funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced themselves that they have experienced some rather hot times and do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think that progress was achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are competing at the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that start on Friday in London after the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the I@@ A@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and banned train@@ ers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told rep@@ orters in London after a talk at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens ME@@ Ps from their land of land in Lower Saxony , the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) had fallen into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green state government must decide whether it could reg@@ ain this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , however , is indispensable , however , that the land tag decides as quickly as possible as soon as possible .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is talking about contam@@ inated eggs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could the sc@@ andal have happened ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can consumers protect themselves .
in the interview , Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ addinol.de war@@ e.de , the federal states have the latest information about the eggs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eggs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all that we know at the moment , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis action - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlighten@@ ment of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and is in close exchange with the authorities of the countries in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just the same way to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are able to transport and are harm@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the resi@@ dual content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , they are not able to reach traffic .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturers and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the production plants are no immediate gu@@ ilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must reck@@ on because of their illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there are little contro@@ l@@ ors in the case of di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea .
is it missing only at the personnel or at the slo@@ ppy jurisdiction ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were just the official controls that have been exposed to the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where off@@ ences can be present , of crucial importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already seen several times that I expect a complete clari@@ fication by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and friendly food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved in@@ sec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to vote .
the pan@@ de@@ ous funds are manufacturers , distributors and consumers to get into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear : the illegal use of in@@ sec@@ tici@@ des fi@@ pron@@ il in the post@@ ure of life @-@ medi@@ ated animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be systematically worked on all levels and working with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all the competent authorities that the property will be quickly and comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the rules that aim to prevent un@@ imp@@ aired issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will yet come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UE@@ FA , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules , which were launched in 2011 by UE@@ FA , mean that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of his contract and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to more than ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
it can make money loose with security so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring it into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team through through the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs may turn a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must deal with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their focus on the football @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UE@@ FA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success were effectively frau@@ ght and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in when banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year trial period that runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will determine the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UE@@ FA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of invoice over the duration of his contract .

the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met with Abu D@@ habi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the hard@@ est sanctions .
the PSG received a penalty of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later fell to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League in season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players .
the UE@@ FA is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial views by raising their income by companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ gic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UE@@ FA would not be regarded as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UE@@ FA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PS@@ A was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar through payments of the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambass@@ ador will be made and a great man@@ eu@@ ver for the UE@@ FA regulation authorities could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PSG imply that the UE@@ FA will be more atten@@ tive to take note of the rules .
the UE@@ FA had no preliminary talks with PSG on N@@ ey@@ mar transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
it is expected that N@@ ey@@ mar arrives a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Trikot@@ express .
the association assumes that sales after signing by at least 30 percent will increase .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s throw , claim@@ ing that PSG would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga for a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they retained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to b@@ ypass the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected to finance the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a portion of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial means for banks in the coming February , although it is expected that they will have 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in the interest rate , they reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain imp@@ etus of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; scale than the markets .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that enh@@ ancements would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecast of the Bank for this and next year will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the previous year in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to not change after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for a net interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .

the recent inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and low rise increases , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing will first become worse before they get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be prevented in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be considerably &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pound , which is part of lower consumption spending .
the decision comes from a year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the fun@@ eral .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
before the last judgment of the bank to interest rates , the call for interest rate was increased because inflation increased the pressure to hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation is dropped by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will again attract them in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that surplus value in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be attributed to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ gom@@ ery , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in the face of the short@@ fall of sw@@ ap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the loan don@@ ors want to look for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .

N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ national &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) reported before sexual inter@@ course , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk levels by around 86 percent , is now delivered from health care over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the process after the App@@ eals Court confirmed the verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of App@@ eal after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess training announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( N@@ AT ) signed this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liver@@ pool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first ones that will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 throughout England .
pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
those who come to question for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a veter@@ in@@ arian can also opt for a possible participation in their local partner sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract for delivery of the drugs in this week following an international competitive acquisition .
the study is intended to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is used in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention was to supplement and over@@ take the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at N@@ AT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is targeted at need@@ y and end@@ anger@@ ed people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ laimed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is to be welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and delay .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative these drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of these li@@ fel@@ ong infection .
this attempt brings us closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the end of spreading of HIV in society .
the big living : mezzanine and clever designers tricks made this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something that was comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have been in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go to the bedroom - wanted to add a space to Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and a mezzanine to optimally utili@@ se the spacious deck height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose they asked the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to accommodate two rooms , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is rather complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on one another without having to b@@ other ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that it had the right amount for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light@@ window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down on the gl@@ amor@@ ous residential area .
handmade gold cabinet , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
in both ends , a short corri@@ dor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow him to work longer .
the kitchen feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance there are mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kit@@ chens are nothing new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual , so it is when you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the basic surface - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real estate agent will enter into a ru@@ di@@ mentary form and carry out a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface and simultaneously use high @-@ quality materials that give the room a luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and that will help to create an emotional relationship in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t owe you to the electrical sockets in walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of something completely aston@@ ishing .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave it .

two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confront@@ ation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business assets are to be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Jeans family established a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now comprises offices in the city zen@@ sh@@ rum , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
following an agreement with their late father Colin - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thir@@ ds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court records that this means that Colin has the value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be an issue for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parti@@ tions proposed by Colin have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin argued that this was not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some owners in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he is hoping to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance claims that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by both parties .
Ms. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ acies from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970s .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin tells that he began West@@ co when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped her property will be grateful to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I often told me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De LU@@ TI@@ S group , with Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars in leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Lukas and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said about the conditions of their financial division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to mo@@ urn me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not wanted that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he still hopes to find a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colin wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media coverage of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a regular course .
here is a piece by rep@@ orter Josh Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with executive staff , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he said : bad information entered into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about it should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagnose makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media integrity .
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral campa@@ igner Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold Tr@@ umps Twitter habits under control , according to six former electoral campaigns , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OK , now I just want BF1918 / 2
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habits have ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps these combat officials don &apos;t know what we do not know - that Tr@@ umps Twe@@ ets contain even more fuel .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly try to present their own agenda by promoting their own agenda by promoting their views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - told in May about the preference of the consultants , the President of strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react like a vol@@ cano to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful che@@ ques , and that he can find out where they origin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone was mal@@ ici@@ ously issued a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile of che@@ ques in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed wrong accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that Chief of Chief of Chief Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;

perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers always strive to influence .
these un@@ alter@@ able factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

some of the wealth@@ i@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with a few determined riders on war @-@ foot , who have negoti@@ ated a tren@@ ch from the municipality to call a field in front of their rulers .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans located outside a wealth@@ y street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports , after they have been thrown out in May , without being dep@@ orted from the council to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They are moved there on Monday evening after they have been forwar@@ ded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May there were continued and are back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham council knows how to deal with it by keeping long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community fee if the Council cannot stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a residents who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorized bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road , and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to pass them as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection , it is very important to report as many residents as anti @-@ social or criminal behavior at the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we proceed to our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the rooms are equipped with large usable showers , the entrance area is transformed , new windows will be built .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the implementation of the ab@@ ode of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme will give the demo@@ cr@@ ats a chance to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special Advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he did not know anything from the inser@@ tion of a Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ration@@ ality , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been no@@ isy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him about a setting of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president is under great pressure because of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the US media , the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees .

unlike an independent Special Agent of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft on Thursday , according to which the Special Agent could no longer be released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gig@@ antic ice @-@ mountain moves in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West Ant@@ arc@@ tic a gig@@ antic ice @-@ mountain is solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s just seven times the size of Berlin .
this was reported by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the tri@@ lli@@ on tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres are now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 km , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people is not going from him .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
at the north of this county , the balance of wax@@ es and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed before a few years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a matter of fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can tear down , if at a key point a piece ab@@ rup@@ tly .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ holm and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and pushed ice as much water as it produces after mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only in a very limited extent , the British research project for observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is according to A@@ WI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s of Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
the transition from the main@@ land is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow again or go back in the long term , and possibly merge together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not lead to the decline of this giant ic@@ eberg , however , many king@@ d@@ oms of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula are falling apart in recent decades .
this long Zi@@ pfel of Ant@@ arc@@ tica stretches towards South America .
according to the data of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Pen@@ insula has gone back to 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula got around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ ame around the areas where the temperature is fastest .

nevertheless , the circle of staff lack the staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann circuit .
among other things , physi@@ cians and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU would like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the U@@ WG together with the initiative and dismis@@ sed the skilled workers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is expected to develop a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development after the wish of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the forward @-@ looking approach of applicants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards internal and external , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete measures for cross @-@ hits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and include a training offensive , call for CDU , FDP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot;

because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy wor@@ sens the sound of NGO mig@@ rant rescue boats &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs don &apos;t sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i , an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Rett@@ et &apos; because their crew worked effectively with men in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to express himself to detailed proposals of Italian prosec@@ ut@@ ors Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Rett@@ et &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that monitors I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that its crew will take infl@@ atable migrants on board , which will be delivered directly to human dealers , and that the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers can travel so that the ships can be used again .
at least one meeting occurred only 1.3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew will be susp@@ icious about the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other subjects .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board to supervis@@ e their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have now been prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Arms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or dis@@ abilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign themselves is the Nobel Prize @-@ Winner Organization Doc@@ tors without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , which was strongly affected by the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coast guard and the cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter for the lyrics that Conrad Roy tried to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction , and five years have been subjected to mal@@ nutrition .
Carter was sentenced in June because Conrad Roy was sentenced to life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was convi@@ cted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she utter@@ ly regre@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation by Ro@@ cky &apos;s mother Lynn Roy , who said that there was no day when I was not able to pray the loss of my beloved Son .
I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to be there for etern@@ ity with us for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; says it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this one person to have , with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I always keep in my life for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call one another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a coal mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the event attracted national attention when Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging on , spring from a building , stop yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was in vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the FC Bayern dre@@ amed a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t harm it .
what was different on his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ ber saw me immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm , and even no Manuel Neuer , he made himself split to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have been better running than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .

Audi will change 8@@ 50,000 Diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer the software to upgrade the software in more than 350@@ ,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chair said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he moved on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler has announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules of carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of the car manufacturers , equipment for neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles , also take up what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ign@@ oring the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could control the use of so @-@ called de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ation devices that regul@@ ate emissions in order to keep the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities were accused of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could impact Volkswagen seriously : the luxury car manufacturer is proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for the latest chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ stopp@@ able drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was reported to them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings .
there are drug s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto in December 2012 , there is no rest of violence , and as President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto won his office in December 2012 , there have been at least seven dead in seven countries in this year .
among the latter is its publisher and its In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez that shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wearing T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared issues , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although 2010 a probe &apos;s office was established in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only been initiated by the committee to protect journalists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with most thousands of kill@@ ings , which are linked to drug trade and organized crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court .
in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they are still insist@@ ing on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally and although the terrain is still more tra@@ m@@ pled .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting discusses the security little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we susp@@ ect all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provin@@ cial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he was only able to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ fter river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t battle@@ fields of the country , as rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum .
there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ een for drug roy@@ als that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tranqui@@ lity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when only one chair has control over the coastal state with its precious ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ eting cards in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have off@@ ended the sons , pres@@ umed gangs bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper boxes .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without kno@@ cking on the premis@@ e problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper has earned a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising revenues .
rep@@ orters were able to publish hard working exam@@ inations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else would handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ ing Mexican drug history , wherever they did .
he volunt@@ arily gave that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team bl@@ ends Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ bird , who could flu@@ ke like a harbour worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for the routine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they do the best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing pages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ este@@ em and self @-@ preservation .
trust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the publisher of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer regarded as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , no phones were allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provin@@ cial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers are among the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen , who described the Gover@@ nor himself as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the rep@@ orter had gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs de fac@@ to stand under control .

there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a Expos@@ é to the State Issues that concentrated on the govern@@ or of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened so was caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who dominated the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ality , among them one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his sl@@ ender body state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers which were prot@@ esting against the assass@@ ination of journalists because the employees were too little what they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez got a few signs and went on the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a verb@@ al body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lu@@ cra@@ tive by direc@@ ting them down in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ ez went away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy journalists and to release them because they told the truth .
she has since then asked that she is once again divided by the government because she is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded by organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials and an equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security coun@@ cils involved in organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you &apos;re dying because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ red effect .
no one forgot the death of the writer Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ etas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to their separate head , a computer keyboard and head@@ phones are available .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Sur in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ slava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana did after the assass@@ ination of their directors in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z was publicly addressed to the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the introduction of the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in ex@@ ile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are h@@ unted by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no need for drug traffi@@ cking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce were sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ mon .
a number of found@@ ries with belt riv@@ als and safety jackets near Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as it was promised by a series of Kartell &apos;s em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the edge of the border , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the introduction was to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ed nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the spot@@ ted founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used Tar@@ nung to avoid his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue if also a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even notice that his sli@@ pper@@ y skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; turbul@@ ent past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researcher , which is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the pan@@ zer@@ te her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks out of the circuit , and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it sle@@ pt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a pil@@ ing shell , probably threatened by flesh @-@ e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly ge@@ pan@@ zer@@ te din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white clo@@ ak to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used an par@@ ach@@ uting technique used as counter @-@ type , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , tell experts what suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time and now is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the exempl@@ ars enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ aded sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature dar@@ ker was dar@@ ker than its bottom .
although the sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs provided enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ ours the accumulation of confront@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the sh@@ aded sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than lo@@ ot , which sign@@ alizes that this cam@@ el @-@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong Raub@@ tier @-@ behaviour on a massive massive pan@@ de@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the Krei@@ de@@ zeit must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on his life , including his con@@ served loan to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and went out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans are probably spreading much further up@@ wards than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served skin but also in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of the animal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that animal today looks almost as much as in the early circle season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is in sleeping . &quot;
the time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ zer@@ te din@@ osau@@ rs were h@@ unted by some of its fear@@ ful ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose newest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the durable arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely removed from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ cre@@ ted plant @-@ e@@ aters were floo@@ ded by Western Canada until a flood river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater best@@ selling of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ ament in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good that the cab@@ b@@ age still cover still hol@@ lowed arm@@ rests along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is so &apos; sel@@ dom as a profit in Lotto .
the more I can see , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ rests that bear the skull of the animal .
his right for@@ ef@@ oot lies on his side , his five fingers are split up@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
on Thursday evening , heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass rally .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ long stops - and G@@ affer .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock , between the junction places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably lor@@ ries , were cra@@ w@@ led .
there is no information available about the exact number of last units .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be easy to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large number of rescue vehicles was at the accident station .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was a total of about ten kilometers long back@@ yard .
like a AZ rep@@ orter , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive dis@@ abilities - through numerous G@@ affer .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade not@@ ated the characteristics of the vehicle steering , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which is to take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you are travelling by train , you know that in addition to delay and missed trains , the train ticket controls are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .

only one day after they arrived in New York City , St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was doing the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live on .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em &apos;s body , which was stretched on the street and stayed there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
there were photos of police band and people who cried , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who had a sign with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed with which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , assured another polic@@ eman &apos;s ri@@ fle , and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals kill all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to us and we can call them typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt sho@@ oter fro@@ st .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they booked a return flight and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a history of survival and the protest , the love and loss , the strength and the power that exists from the point of view of people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who had a flower dress and a fitting crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that she had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that wasn &apos;t true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and it will be drawn up .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the happiness to give her an experience in which she experiences no ec@@ cent@@ ric rac@@ ism , she is not different than the next black women baby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel that I would show you a bad service to keep them off from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was at a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation by the Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health in@@ equ@@ alities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of women - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on were not c@@ entered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are depicted , as I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s experience - to show that there is not a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved herself as the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documents reveal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ llas &apos;s life as she mar@@ ries in love and her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black @-@ gay women in the broader black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , based on the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ Liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in social media in 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is kept in black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person carrying out this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the front of the front , because with a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone missing , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no Man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etting ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mag@@ nific@@ ence ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the other stores benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gallery is planned exactly on the plot , on which the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the start of construction work will be finished .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been spending almost weekly in the farming market for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always happy to be happy .
also the Metz@@ ger@@ ei discovered we discovered for us .
we would like that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other towns , there are also .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether direct @-@ mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;

* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are left here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least get the market hall .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is reason@@ ably priced .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because they are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and that which is still left , will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bit Gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gallery before , all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s simply not going to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a right peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the crazy many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the premis@@ e of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible to the ceiling hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fern and Haar@@ etz , which you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st was a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after she was publicly accused of diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspon@@ dent between D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline had their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gender and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg is created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extra@@ cted by Mann@@ ing and made from 30 portra@@ its , such as someone could be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been openly condemned as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that it was only a single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ fie , in which man sits visi@@ bly un@@ comfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
the artist portra@@ ys portra@@ its of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extra@@ cted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg , at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit this time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their imprison@@ ed m@@ use were too un@@ equal , who changed several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; who predicted a future in which the President Chel@@ ten@@ oud would be able to see the exhibition personally .
Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy commitment .
in the opening of the exhibition there is a bit low and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve to escape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one of the artistic statement , Mann@@ ing demanded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called on the wall of the gallery ( the &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her family name is with a heart ) an end of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ful@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show with the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific ency@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so that the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate space is one side from the comic book mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing how it emerg@@ es with a free sp@@ ear in the hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ ose when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if they should do it , it will be gre@@ eted in the middle of the room of mas@@ ks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ations , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic link groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; D@@ ew@@ ey Hag@@ borg said of the portra@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nation @-@ wide crowd is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are considered susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly wounds .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of her alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the County Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ lets .
a public warning system was published by the Chicago Police Office that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still on the spot for dead , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police searches for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ b@@ age , Vice @-@ President of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em is now evalu@@ ating and excluded from entering the Campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ b@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University of Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help US investig@@ ators in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he requests susp@@ ects to susp@@ ect the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of her residence , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a phone call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , that had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza released an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ ADA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ADA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the timet@@ able Rus@@ ada has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the W@@ ADA timet@@ able was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ ADA timet@@ able to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re@@ deployment of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ADA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported results of the approved study by the Canadian Attor@@ ney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accepted dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the start of the day S@@ mir@@ nov caused problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rus@@ ada was excluded in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the W@@ ADA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July W@@ ADA General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that Rus@@ ada moves into the right direction in order to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not dare to process the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to make surveys , perform special groups and demo@@ graphics groups , employees anon@@ ym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allows to handle the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursu@@ ing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
he said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , there is a heat map of the company that shows which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which executives have low sensitivity - so that you can bow down why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog post that has been pun@@ ished , in which those who have spoken , were pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .

as G@@ LIN@@ T , Conver@@ ge companies will send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat map of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report wrong behavior .
and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the super@@ visory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has caught regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ gence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his employees are badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and pl@@ agues , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has conver@@ ge for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she would find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , since the company conver@@ ts , problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states may have been hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair work plac@@ e- quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to sei@@ ze ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ic violations due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies recognised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are exp@@ ecting more than ever before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salary and interesting projects are only applied .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work that you do is worth@@ while , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employ@@ ee Experience on LinkedIn who used both conver@@ gence and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if the Analytics tool promises to increase engagement and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it can have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come quickly enough , or not at all , it can b@@ other dec@@ eption and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 questions , you &apos;ll have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen themselves too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of yourself ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly contribut@@ ors , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem was reported via G@@ LIN@@ T .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights about the employees , and hopes that in a long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when you lose weight , you lose your customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two days practices and makes a long day for the bro@@ od
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of UC@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their shirt heads and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this is a lunch break .
players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center in the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real treadmill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
this is why the first three courses of UC@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise way from two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time in Mor@@ as six play times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 , they should ab@@ stain 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal playing prepar@@ atory for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the N@@ CA@@ A rule , even if they add another point to the many busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it down , they are picking up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
UC@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished , which has been abandoned in view of the clear lines of his fields from an ad@@ joining car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been laid with foot@@ balls , which is not an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there , and then set up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;

the problem is also in Europe a big political issue , with the French vot@@ ers have been floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan to be pun@@ ished after the social media networks , if they do not succeed in elimin@@ ating the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ t@@ orial insp@@ ectors are challenged , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Comic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was able to see in a squ@@ e@@ eze @-@ music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ 2000 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cosy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to watch the manus@@ cript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; surro@@ unds the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just re@@ acted on the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters smell like smoke ; for at that time there is a fire for the light of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as if he himself would be there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is doing so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a bit over@@ rated &quot; ) , all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ m@@ ns on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in dig@@ its .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with Land@@ scap@@ es , G@@ ärt@@ nern , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust has received full access when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he referred to as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ l it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English emp@@ ires , maps that show what had said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you might think that land conflict would be boring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go out ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , followed by a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant rise of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a record that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ff@@ ins Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant u@@ prising began in this area and I thought that an insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , telling the history of the Jes@@ u@@ it pat@@ ron , who hid the Dar@@ rell family during the English Re@@ formation seven years .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , portra@@ yed his own fun@@ eral by filling a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dar@@ ts are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite che@@ ek@@ y , getting deb@@ ts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by married women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent to wer@@ ve Er@@ in . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for another unique scre@@ aming experience
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ dem@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a San@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which since then returned from nature again .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday release site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one which gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost her new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fears in front of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara joined the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) about reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officers &quot; Corps .
so this week also .
on the first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer in the building of the General Staff , as earlier , but in the office of the prime minister .
on the consult@@ ations , the five Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consult@@ ations .

the government moves the rein@@ s in the military .
general Staff Hul@@ usi Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the navy were set off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the failed coup leader Erd@@ og@@ an established 169 of 326 General Ch@@ urches and Ad@@ mir@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army &apos;s ranks - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire pulling of the coup .
against 486 people who have been involved directly in the coup attempt , this week will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an really got a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ fortunately in the Military &apos;s headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head ban for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed as if Erd@@ og@@ an was ge@@ aring to the military . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .

after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .

Washington is changing the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited from the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stri@@ c@@ ter regulations for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will be good to our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the contract on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country will be defini@@ tive , explained Sü@@ hl .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as an operator can agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sü@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sit @-@ ups have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and selecting it all , from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to type or the color of his finger .
but it is still wor@@ r@@ ying because many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would let a Step@@ ford wife seem progres@@ sively .
modern sit @-@ ups have developed into a robot with a silicone skin .
the real B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they find appealing , such as sh@@ ear tern@@ ess .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robots developed with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of Schü@@ p@@ tern@@ ess and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the Web site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has its mood - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed at conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many troub@@ les@@ ome aspects associated with this adv@@ ancement of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous female characteristics , the play@@ fulness to ra@@ pe when one goes to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : contra@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one most .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a Vi@@ br@@ ator , why can men do not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophis@@ tic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sex@@ es towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men naturally do not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain preliminary on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ ep out of the border zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very in@@ structive .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or off@@ ended until they give the free market for this permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House , who has pra@@ yed to have women sex@@ ually attacked .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report &apos; of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the closed body and the stri@@ pped eyes , but how realistic this vision is acting .
the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ blan@@ ce to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( alb@@ eit with porno@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their gro@@ wers want to feel hum@@ ane that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , at the point when it comes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background story , nothing , what could inter@@ fere with independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
expressed differently : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the words of 2017 : maid maid
Tr@@ ump &apos;s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the concept of healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a bin@@ sen@@ ess of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. elect@@ orate , have also divided families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving Day , there was a number of advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump &apos;s vot@@ ers .

less notic@@ eable is the power of tr@@ umps , families .
I mention this because my c@@ ous@@ ins , a left @-@ aligned poet , lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context , that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dep@@ ended effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we are referring to the gr@@ us@@ ern@@ y possibility that the cookies of one day will no longer be thrown out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is still a difficult long @-@ term scenario , &quot; norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the Right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison with his standards suddenly as a concept of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself nowadays about an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the crazy - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact as very mild pen@@ alties .
if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be mentally healthy to quali@@ fy as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my C@@ ous@@ ine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York par@@ quet department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need c@@ aff@@ eine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ c@@ eful and the animals are turning to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ friendly music convey@@ s this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
five and thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , as here two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years and all have a great time .

red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflam@@ matory intestinal disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your di@@ ges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflam@@ matory bow@@ el diseases .
the inc@@ urable condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US , affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cra@@ mp@@ s and par@@ aly@@ sis , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness .
while the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines will pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food cannot penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tis@@ sues .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflam@@ matory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it has been found that a type of tolerance supp@@ ressing immune cells in mice , which contribute to a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illu@@ s Reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet toler@@ ate less inflam@@ matory bow@@ el mili@@ eus if the same system also acts with people .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan searched for a kind of immun@@ os@@ cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tri@@ bal , which had not had been hous@@ ed .
it pres@@ umed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ ct .
bacteria of the@@ Y@@ er@@ sin@@ i@@ agen@@ us el@@ ic@@ it intestinal wall@@ inflamm@@ ation@@ and serious di@@ arr@@ ho@@ eal disease as well as other afflic@@ tions in humans . this gen@@ us includes the@@ pl@@ ague path@@ ogen .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were created by the L. Reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria react to the immune system , the researchers L. Reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ rip@@ e immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the cell &apos;s tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
as the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ated cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. Reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tra@@ ps .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. Reu@@ ter@@ i can develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in gene related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with inflam@@ matory intestinal diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can result in the presence of L. Reu@@ ter@@ i to expand this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind turns out : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel is still a SPD leader , S &amp; D ministers looked to Berlin with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only no interference from the party headquarters , merely no counter @-@ wind from the Bund - was the most important wish of the electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundament@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als .

the federal CDU looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber on the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Gre@@ ens ME@@ Ps has over@@ thrown the government by Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the land elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party of the Green Party , Michael Kell@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has promp@@ ted the slo@@ ped Dutch Green Party Elke T@@ westen called to return their mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ sign@@ ation to the CDU means a clear corruption of the vot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister and election leader of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD election fighter , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ schaft reached the party headquarters in Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ coming of the green ME@@ Ps Elke T@@ westen to the CDU without its own government majority .
it is the provis@@ ional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly significant defeat in the Saarland @-@ election in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of STE@@ G Urban Development were informed on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened until now .
since 1991 it has been in sensi@@ bly refur@@ bishment areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thir@@ ds of the funding amount .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development and not only develop new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the total amount of funding was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros came from the country , the rest of the municipality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does a rehabilitation area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will continue to investigate , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of interest , to san@@ ction .
if necessary , the territ@@ orial boundaries could also be post@@ pon@@ ed again .

the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that means a plot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rehabilitation area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the permit period for funding is running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the survey will be carried out once again , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a question@@ naire for filling .
in November or December , as possible , the stat@@ utes should be made in order to begin with the renov@@ ations next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each Commun@@ e had to carry out the said advance exam@@ inations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this is why there will be question@@ n@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and to be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow question@@ naire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is among other things around the structural condition and the renovation intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray question@@ naire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; run sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled when used in the building of business premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled question@@ naire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the funding instrument in accordance with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wind @-@ dog principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is first functional - who first comes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House to fly a naval helic@@ opter to the South Law@@ n for an event that highlights American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military service provided by TIME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries .
the helic@@ opter used in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fighter car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military bure@@ au of the White House demanded the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mental order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter was on the South Law@@ n , following the records of the Navy Hel@@ ic@@ opter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the dep@@ uty marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helic@@ opter arrived at the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 : 00 and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would need for return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helic@@ opter , while the security personnel of the unit remained at the ground during the time on the ground .

the Hat@@ ch Act prohib@@ its federal and state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the destiny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we created was whether it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy Command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and was not covered by Hat@@ ch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to rein@@ force the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
President is obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February when the presidential plane took place before the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ain about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thri@@ lled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Press Officer of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South Law@@ n by setting up the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ers .
as Tr@@ ump in early July on the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helic@@ opter units also fle@@ w 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential &quot; support missions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers received the burden for no other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helic@@ opter on the South Law@@ n .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop budgets for the presidential run , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D revenue set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end of the war , it is not the only one in the world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House argued that the actual cost for the operation of the helic@@ opter was far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for income rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund for Do@@ D does not include staff costs , but also account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .
the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er def@@ ended the use of the helic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helic@@ opter when he entered his tour across the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ ammed with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed response partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Faculty of Youth Aid , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
bo@@ iling is still out of house : a Cater@@ er takes care of this task and supplies freshly cooled cooled .
the city operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 , the children get a warm meal at noon .
in the past day of Kit@@ aj@@ ahr , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are car@@ ed for 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have a kitchen service from 1st September : they heating the delivered food , complement it around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are assigned to a K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group sessions , as well as seven units - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to implement education concepts for the management of kit@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is important : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children will help to prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
also for children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the puri@@ fication of the k@@ ita rooms - so far as the task of the refriger@@ ation forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of clean@@ liness and kitchen service - has also the charm that it has found in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and alien@@ ation for the city as the most economical , is called it from the press office .
and that , even though 46 part @-@ time forces will be re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall not so strong at about 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a certain contribution to managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie in order to make the long @-@ term commitment to production in their works in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had to wei@@ gh over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces plan@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company leader of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; express concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ roll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentrated on the local community and the greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent work in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .
it is therefore necessary in the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and in front of the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising civil costs and the chron@@ ical output of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently urg@@ ently a thri@@ ving production trade with Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman by Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this since we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a regular meeting with colleagues and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we discussed with the employees that we are active in a highly competitive and in@@ secure economic climate in a highly competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changing at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the PSG Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regre@@ t your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main is not ref@@ using to prosec@@ ute N@@ ey@@ mar after spending an offer of £ 189 million to release his release cl@@ ause , but did they war@@ n Barcelona before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , and Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and for the highest professional sport@@ sman in the world .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has en@@ forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ an Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned against this prospect three years ago ?
as Manchester City 2014 interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club express interest in the PSG mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
it was clear that they would not permit it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eved the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eved by Pope John Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Wei@@ her@@ man , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would be very much to regard the view of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regre@@ t about their own om@@ issions or at that time false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting about violence in the dome @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two kinds of measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the intervention in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; act that would be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also princ@@ ess Gloria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bayer@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re happy to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lows a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with fre@@ chen children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger frequently appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report which was submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg to the En@@ lighten@@ ment Attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 domain cats are sex@@ ually ab@@ used .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in contrast to many other accused , many victims are in@@ estim@@ able of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him , in spite of violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report to the abuse of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , has been reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contra@@ dict@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students empha@@ size his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a cholesterol and perf@@ ection@@ ist that has been hand @-@ tan@@ gible when a dom@@ eter has no top performance .
how do you evaluate the final report as his bi@@ ogra@@ pher ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he is currently devoted to eight sites , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ dle@@ - or fel@@ lowship with the horri@@ ble cases sexual abuse .
even the victims of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside its sphere of sphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent witness , describes him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warm @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelli@@ gible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as an extremely good teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by children &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and his high emotional appeal , which led to w@@ ut@@ ches .

to his salvation , however , it must be said that such education methods in the fra@@ grant period , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents as well as teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a world @-@ wide school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violence of violence at the primary school are of course dig@@ ni@@ fied .

in the Bavarian pop@@ e there are many who have never understood it yet still e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported in the media .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put any involvement or co @-@ knowing in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual inter@@ rog@@ ation claims to have committed themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never forgot to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finding Carter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : Trailer zu Staffel 2B ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they do not trust their parents and brothers and sisters , then it is certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in relation to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student form@@ ulated it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he had been able to find evidence ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really absur@@ d to accept that ... Bub@@ ble penet@@ rated or clear@@ er or even more open than compared to their parents , dor@@ mit@@ ories , trust teachers etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that one speaks with him about sex ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up students and / or their environment , the study could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any sympath@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ dict@@ ory crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent expressions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to Look &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; DRAGON Ball Z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Leg@@ end@@ ary Su@@ pers@@ ai@@ y@@ aj@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eng &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and bl@@ ended to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Cathedral @-@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once more .
in addition , the report has been treated from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the ch@@ oral leader of the Cathedral @-@ atzen .
the entire horri@@ ble exam@@ inations , the cases where boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were ch@@ ic@@ iled and mal@@ ign@@ ited and suffered from them , were all at the primary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prev@@ ail .
but with whom the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did not do anything , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the cathedral @-@ gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this way , as most of the witnesses empha@@ size , the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; para@@ dies@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what was different from the cathedral @-@ gymn@@ asi@@ um ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of R. estimates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims have even positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in spite of all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported from the states at the primary school .
the first time of 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again at 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger conce@@ aled the ears before the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ gymn@@ asi@@ um , which is even re@@ produced by the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , he points to this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press conferences , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time , as legal clarity , as exam@@ inations in Bavaria had long been banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the ad@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we histori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall @-@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i.e. the danger of evalu@@ ating past moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but this does not apply to sexual abuse that was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children of children , that goes far beyond that time .

but at the same time I have to take a protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ in@@ ating and pun@@ ish@@ ments , so ear fei@@ gen and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a physical punishment , it has been strictly prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his time in the time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
re : please honor best postings / Lob für Member postings
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , since the Cathedral @-@ atzen played only one side role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t mean that he led a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this must be said once again : without this perf@@ ection@@ ist , without requiring un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambass@@ ad@@ ors of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone one does not make a big singer and before any success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for a man , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in conversations with her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , profound , deep believing and heart@@ felt people from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something like a fly .
I regularly get up with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are still today , 23 years after his em@@ placement , regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the Cathedral @-@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , v@@ ascular teacher - a strict father , certain that may be - but also a delightful resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to whom she is still able to look at today and whom she has practically hon@@ oured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , even once completely clear : all that is accused of him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be glad that we have been overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al scap@@ eg@@ oat .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , the starting point , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside Bay@@ erns , and perhaps in Germany , no one knows the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
