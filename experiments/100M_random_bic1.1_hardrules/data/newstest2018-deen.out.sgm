<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are all other than current - but are therefore very short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a carpet-carpet, which is not immediately recognizable as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and communities, detailed maps were incorporated into the large picture postcard, so-called urine-sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the data of the Bavarian Palace Department between 1810 and 1864, and arises from Bavaria's first surveying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French HeeresGuide occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War, with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied land and ordered a topographic record of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were abducted with the Peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, there were today's neighbors who created the idea of an area-wide Bayern-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Palace Department." ""</seg>

<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings concentrated around 1856 along the today Plinganserstraße, which was named 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, there is nothing to see than fields - at first sight: a small-piece card with dirty lines and numbers: hand-written numbered flurries from the so-called "urine sample" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>

<seg id="31">In the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads only the street name "am Gasteig" or at the height of "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>

<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the sorrowed overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to drastically restrict the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller's handle doesn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have been gynned if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their meaning, and especially the meaning that you were written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added.</seg>

<seg id="106">The poem on which you relate to which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is right, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only load any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your fatigue, your arms, and your oppressed masses, who have longing to breathe freely, and the eleventful waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "saving litter" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">He did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trump USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly how Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people wanted to change this for a long time from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great Schreihals Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not one of them, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring American flame to the converted world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not lighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">But Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and at all a question of standing point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as it was seen from the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play Rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to more than ten million dollars a year.</seg>

<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations that had taken enormous debt in their quest for success were effectively fraught and risked to ruin when banks or owners returned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year trial period that runs until 2018, clubs can take losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>

<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to oversee their financial views by raising their income by companies that are associated with the owners of a club.</seg>

<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar WM ambassador will be made and a great maneuver for the UEFA regulation authorities could be easy to figure out.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transnational" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that a preexpositional prophylaxis (prep) reported before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk levels by around 86 percent, is now delivered from health care over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He was willing to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court of Appeal after which the NHS had the authority to pay for prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him.</seg>

<seg id="1296">Preexpositional phylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission at risk of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medication may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who come to question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated successfully.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants are identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a veterinarian can also opt for a possible participation in their local partner sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract for delivery of the drugs in this week following an international competitive acquisition.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study is intended to assess the entire potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is used in a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention was to supplement and overtake the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said: "this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, if it is targeted at needy and endangered people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards, people with high HIV risk have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument, which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with armor and resembles a piling shell, probably threatened by flesh-eaters dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly gepanzerte dinosaurs used a red and white cloak to hide from predators, and used an parachuting technique used as counter-type, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, tell experts what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time and now is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the exemplars enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shaded shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature darker was darker than its bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs provided enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that the evolution favours the accumulation of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the shaded shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this camel-rier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong Raubtier-behaviour on a massive massive pandeous dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Kreidezeit must have been," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on his life, including his conserved loan to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and went out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably spreading much further upwards than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved skin but also in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal" "", "Brown said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much fantasy to reconstruct it. if you're just a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is in sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tynosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the panzerte dinosaurs were hunted by some of its fearful ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose newest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the durable armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely removed from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the pancreted plant-eaters were flooded by Western Canada until a flood river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater bestselling of the dinosaur preserved its armament in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good that the cabbage still cover still hollowed armrests along the dinosaur</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the premise of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible to the ceiling hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, which you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst was a 35-year prison sentence, after she was publicly accused of diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>

<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg is created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and made from 30 portraits, such as someone could be interpreted with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly condemned as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 accusations, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that it was only a single photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which man sits visibly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist portrays portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts like cigarette and chewing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>

<seg id="2138">The artist and their imprisoned muse were too unequal, who changed several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images," who predicted a future in which the President Cheltenoud would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was able to see in a squeeze-music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-er and 1980-2000.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moped Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2295">'a Castle in England 'surrounds the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, to look through the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hymns on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in digits.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with Landscapes, Gärtnern, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey and started writing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust has received full access when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in the English history, including 'The Labourer', followed by a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant rise of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a record that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled" Kniffins Families of Kent and Sussex "" "," Rhodes said. "" "</seg>

<seg id="2313">"" "maybe the two are interconnected?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', telling the history of the Jesuit patron, who hid the Darrell family during the English Reformation seven years.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century, portrayed his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later than his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "the darts are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney:" "" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite cheeky, getting debts and spend money for things they couldn't afford." ""</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be crazy 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sit-ups have developed from their inflatable partners to robot with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs, "and selecting it all, from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the nipples up to type or the color of his finger.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying because many robots have the "personalities" that would let a Stepford wife seem progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sit-ups have developed into a robot with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they find appealing, such as shear terness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of Schüpterness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "warms the Web site of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has its mood - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed at conversation or she can be" "" "in mood." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troublesome aspects associated with this advancement of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subspicuous female characteristics, the playfulness to rape when one goes to Frigid (called here: contrasting) Farrah, restless one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) have a Vibrator, why can men do not have a Roxxxy?" "" "said it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">But these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men naturally do not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain preliminary on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seep out of the border zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or offended until they give the free market for this permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House, who has prayed to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report 'of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the closed body and the stripped eyes, but how realistic this vision is acting.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want to feel humane that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, at the point when it comes to" "" "personalities" "", "the robots represent no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing, what could interfere with independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Expressed differently: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the words of 2017: maid maid</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US, affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and paralysis, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected person is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines will patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food cannot penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerance suppressing immune cells in mice, which contribute to a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus Reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Reuteri and one of Tryptophan-rich diet tolerate less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also acts with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched for a kind of immunoscell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribal, which had not had been housed.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Bacteria of theYersiniagenus elicit intestinal wallinflammationand serious diarrhoeal disease as well as other afflictions in humans. this genus includes theplague pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not develop an intestinal microbiome, and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were created by the L. Reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria react to the immune system, the researchers L. Reuteri left in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the cell's tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component was cleansed out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism which is known as an indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerated cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. Reuteri in our gastrointestinal traps.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-side products from L. Reuteri can develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in gene related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2914">He is currently devoted to eight sites, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the middle- or fellowship with the horrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope there are many who have never understood it yet still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen has been reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put any involvement or co-knowing in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual interrogation claims to have committed themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>

<seg id="2936">If they do not trust their parents and brothers and sisters, then it is certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in relation to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student formulated it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he had been able to find evidence (Georg Ratzinger) and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to accept that... Bubble penetrated or clearer or even more open than compared to their parents, dormitories, trust teachers etc.</seg>

<seg id="2947">"" "DRAGON Ball Z:" "" "the Legendary Supersaiyajin" "" "eng" ""</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and blended to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Cathedral-atzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once more.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report has been treated from the time since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral leader of the Cathedral-atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The entire horrible examinations, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were chiciled and malignited and suffered from them, were all at the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger did not do anything, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the cathedral-gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this way, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the theme" "" "Pre-school" "" "tabu." ""</seg>

<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "what was different from the cathedral-gymnasium?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "" "many victims" "" "of R. estimates that" "" "many victims have even positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2960">In spite of all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported from the states at the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time of 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again at 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger concealed the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-gymnasium, which is even reproduced by the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this way, he points to this point," "" "that in the pre-school will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press conferences, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time, as legal clarity, as examinations in Bavaria had long been banned.</seg>

<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the Examination of the Examination of Schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we historians are talking about the" "" "fall-strick of Anachronism," "" "i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse that was abominable at all times and not for what was broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children of children, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take a protection from Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplinating and punishments, so ear feigen and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">"" "" "" "as a physical punishment, it has been strictly prohibited." ""</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his time in the time has Georg Ratzinger in talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Re: please honor best postings / Lob für Member postings</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the Cathedral-atzen played only one side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">"" "" "" "I don't mean that he led a strict regiment there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said once again: without this perfectionist, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone one does not make a big singer and before any success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">"" "" "" "as for a man, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in conversations with her book?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again as a wonderful, humorous, profound, deep believing and heartfelt people from which one can't imagine that he could do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get up with how many former Domspatzen are still today, 23 years after his emplacement, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>

<seg id="2991">Most of the Cathedral-atzen are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, vascular teacher - a strict father, certain that may be - but also a delightful respectful person, to whom she is still able to look at today and whom she has practically honoured.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"" "" "" "and please, even once completely clear: all that is accused of him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda." ""</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have been overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and a more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
