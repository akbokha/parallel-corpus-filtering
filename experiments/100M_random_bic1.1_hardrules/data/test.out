representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new jobs in their disputes concerning a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more working amp@@ utation from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers were ab@@ used to deal with concerns about the treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed upon the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have remained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troub@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the Treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and demands official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working amp@@ utation that begins beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disputes led to the assist@@ ants of this year thre@@ ef@@ old , the first overall fail@@ ures in the history of N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the B@@ MA Assist@@ ance Office Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back to the rejection of the agreed contractual conditions that were recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings that were still held before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight month war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin sees his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg palace in reception , I can &apos;t deny that Ankara would like this reconciliation in most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was li@@ vel@@ ous and radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for its restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that the relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper said that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been so troub@@ led , as would never happen to happen .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiation eman@@ ating from Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was des@@ erted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin told Putin and accused Ankara to be caught in the back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to re@@ build the Vet@@ rop@@ en becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erd@@ og@@ ans have benef@@ ited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use he wanted to hear from President Erd@@ og@@ an .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clearly obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs a first line of all friends who can get it after last month with a failed coup of state almost of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are res@@ umed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week predi@@ cts state television cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists are long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West because it is reaction to the tried of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuing gro@@ ll on the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian State chief won a bonus in Ankara , that he called for the attempted coup of coup for the elected state organs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep fear of reg@@ im@@ ew@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it was once described by an analy@@ st , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that fall from the West and are badly treated and now burned . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both presi@@ dents said on the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey missed to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to empha@@ size them .
there is no clear con@@ sensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found to Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ asters , as NATO member Turkey fired the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again .

they supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and stock exchange are to be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , as how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cally for three years if we had said that we would have a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .

Russia &apos;s Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin is un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed with Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest competit@@ or of confidence .
( F ) stands for Facts , ( S ) for Students &apos; opinion , ( P ) for Professor &apos;s opinion and ( A ) for the opinion of the al@@ umni .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dismis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Deputy Chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 , he was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is ( Russian ) that he later became a protocol chief and head leader of the government prob@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for leaving his posts and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
see the faces of sm@@ iling faces ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step has been mysteri@@ ously imag@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest friends and working as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ umed their own request .
but despite the sm@@ iling for the cameras , there are only a few of them - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .

but the official claim - that a man who was once pra@@ ised as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed to great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin to be c@@ ited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say this very complicated post - you could almost say - throwing items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the position in December 2011 .
he had previously been Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , as Putin president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) was appointed by the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , he trusted most .
it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia &apos;s second term as a third term of the coup against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close allies coup , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he later became the President three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weigh@@ s 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 metric tons .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business Minister Keith Brown also took a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of engineering crafts@@ manship from a truly epic dimension in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate work which requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total there are almost 79 % of the total bridge deck on their place and the last section of the deck is now getting in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struct@@ ors said : &quot; the first cap in each bridge project represents a considerable milestone .
in this fantastic project , the closure represents future @-@ oriented high @-@ performance and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern part of the shelter 700 millimeters in the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate work .
massive because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , about 6,@@ 000 tons and had to be pulled up by approx . 3 % up@@ wards .
as the toler@@ ances on which the team works , they were tiny - on each side , they were just a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .

the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re RN@@ LI fire station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved out of its own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have been blowing the boat out of their reach until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a Bo@@ je hanging without rescue life@@ jacket .
they all came on board of the rescue boat and were brought back to rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , the boat ste@@ ered away from the person who lost the boat .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD propos@@ es a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept for living &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
firm of the Year for Distribution and Franch@@ ising Os@@ borne Clarke
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cheap apartments can also be created in stock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent , but 20 percent of the apartments as social housing as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing construction programme that will cost millions of dollars and will have to be financed , should provide incen@@ tives for incen@@ tives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU would like to make investors as few rules as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left wants harder conditions for investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
if the concept concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the experts .
but still the program is not totally : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of another around 1300 low @-@ cost apartments whose promotion will run over the next few years ?
there are 500 apartments alone until 2020 .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now buy regular connections from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get back into the price bond again .
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the west of the west , the end of the year runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot;

only : this does not want the owners who do not use housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social homes in the western city is again dras@@ tically increased , one can be removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a concentration of social @-@ poor in only a few districts should not give it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be a movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CDU has to be with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market .
but what does not mean that yet another compromise can be found .

the time on the screen was initially on TV , then on video games and recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a car@@ toon series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture dropped the interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
how does it work ?
in short , players go to their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon , who are tra@@ cked with a GPS , and once they have been discovered , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; tra@@ pped . &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average person returns every day .
Cardi@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post announced recently that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company knows not who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data on performance .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take a 30 minutes time to &quot; get away from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day to be active , &quot; because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look like .

according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s fatal attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped and list@@ ened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand@@ gun , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fle@@ w with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police said that the three times murder was not the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y accident , as the Att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 involved in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the fo@@ undry has driven the investig@@ ators to become a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic houses within four months and two injured two injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard said K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown Nis@@ sans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac and Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks have been linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injury and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting on an empty Pickup truck a half hour before the triple murder and it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat and ball frag@@ ment from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his age enjoyed Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , over which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know anything during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t make it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t manage this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to let go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does not vote at all -- of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Ed@@ mund could never recognize her under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help of a remedy .
Ed@@ mund was neither sitting nor cra@@ mp@@ ed until his third year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot;
he can run and cycle bicycles .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto reminds of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?

this is what I point to me under the Women &apos;s Olympic Committee and that out of more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been at every summer Olympics in 1984 and the US had never been so dominant .
and secondly : this crew has three Tur@@ ner@@ innen , Simone bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly rais@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ oli@@ cs , makes everybody proud .
this crew finally mirrors the United States .
it has bol@@ stered the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was a Af@@ ro @-@ American girl .

this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad @-@ win@@ ner@@ in and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they did unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ event event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly rais@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so do sports classes in the whole country .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ists in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts , primarily in private gymn@@ asts , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competitive and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and Famili@@ es ) .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts receive their entire workout and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment for families .

we need to be inspired by the municipalities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible turn@@ table .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
in my events , we have a free and affordable tur@@ bo in Harlem for about 15@@ ,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and national and international winners are trained .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ et@@ own ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this crew who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team golf and thanks , you are motivated so many young girls with different back@@ grounds to begin their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who voted for election rejected him .
in July , Hunt had unveil@@ ed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at times of movement .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assist@@ ants , injured last night in a message with : &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ ärzte have agreed to the proposed treaty as before serious concerns , in particular , that it will heal the current occup@@ ancy crisis and to treat all physi@@ cians . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeremy Hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has to act now to lift up the vibration and address the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to carry out further workers .
the last strike at the end of April saw an advance of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 fut@@ ures , as nur@@ ses and denti@@ sts were included to grant doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants to pay a better weekly pay for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS staff , demanded the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working amp@@ f@@ eit measures reach nothing but little , but heavy duty teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worry , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past two months , we talked to the assist@@ ants of the assist@@ ants and answered a positive response with the Ministry of Health , as well as other mini@@ stri@@ es , respon@@ ding to concerns about the predomin@@ ance and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training courses , additional training for those who return from a professional return , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , further education and the Ministry of Health related to the observ@@ ance of agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart inf@@ ants will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day @-@ medication after being recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister these more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflam@@ matory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
this medication is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE des N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE des N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140@@ .000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation f@@ etal material in the ar@@ tery walls caused by b@@ lows .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through blood flow and c@@ logged blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the study of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recomm@@ ends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole LON@@ GS@@ ON , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Policy Research Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effective in reducing additional heart attacks and impact attacks in people who had already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand the available treatment options for thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the effic@@ acy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft design recomm@@ ends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets L@@ ut@@ to Rah@@ man was appointed last year to release a government report for corruption from office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is ignor@@ ant , as a devast@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ nic b@@ lows the police , election observation and town houses to have been ignored because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister for integration and municipal government , who is now a ant@@ agon@@ ist king , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut@@ dow@@ ns outside of electoral cabins to protect the vot@@ ers .
he recomm@@ ends that vot@@ ers should lead an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must only name its name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the fingers of a person , if they submit their vote to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , Sir Eric said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to local documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the communist government in front of broader corruption and financial bet@@ ting culture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Ele@@ ction Center in London .
last year , a special court ruled that the am@@ ending Mayor L@@ ut@@ fur Rah@@ man was to become corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man must &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation in which one person cho@@ oses another person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud in the whole country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he expressed himself in particular al@@ arm@@ ing to dec@@ ei@@ ving the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - with the older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including joining methods to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic min@@ orities have been practic@@ ed , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or bang@@ lad@@ en@@ ical background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such behaviour have ignored such behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists can process letter templates to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is dra@@ fted by Ther@@ esa May , requires harder registration tests to prevent the election of immigration and social bet@@ ting purposes .
consider choosing vot@@ ers before choosing your ID card .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they released their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic checks on the nationality of a person must be carried out to ensure that they are right .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter code .
ban on political activists to process complete letters and envel@@ opes of letters of letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police force the authority to set off barriers for election stations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change in law that facilitates an accus@@ ation of inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

requirement that only English in the election stations may be used ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees will rule the rule that vot@@ ers are going to go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the TRU@@ TH has stated L@@ ut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty to corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ tical , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was ple@@ aded guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absur@@ d controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the town houses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitu@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Court of Jud@@ gement in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud hei@@ r as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she laid them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants out of the delivery , pulled out her own st@@ ump pants and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even tried to find a somewhat discre@@ te place to do it - she simply stood there , fre@@ ch as Oskar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled off the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like to put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers in close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer to your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one approached you from behind , then you should turn to the first so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the gun between your arm and shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ b@@ ows .
beat him with the knees in the body and twi@@ sting , while the att@@ acker is bent against pain , the gun out of his hands . beat him with the course and move back@@ wards while keeping the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the casting line , grab the weapon and rotate it so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time keep the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then rotate the gun out of his handle before moving back@@ wards and align the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est to submit your money - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
traveler Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide to his tongue in the most dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ms of a serious testing - by using some of the most dirty and ec@@ st@@ worthy places in Europe able@@ .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k put his course on a Euro ticket , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a sink of a ten@@ sile toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system .
in front of any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to .
but the experiment that was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to swal@@ low the sink of a ten@@ sile toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others may be totally absur@@ d , but actually in a kitchen rin@@ se more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria and its own health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and ate unique and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to railway stations to flus@@ hing kn@@ itting of toilets , the task set out its immune system definitely under a trial
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test finish showed a lumin@@ ometer speed of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers are freshly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after her L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers were more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I have in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to le@@ ak here because it is here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we led back Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of discussing the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had spar@@ ed some of the things I had instruct@@ ed him , like the ec@@ ologically Russian toil@@ ette shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things when it was easier to put Ian to le@@ ak them and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ mol@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls referred to cau@@ li@@ flower holes , wooden floors were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was spread on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was decorated on the walls .
the family were spot@@ ted and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Donna Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the household administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they fear@@ ed that the apartment was no longer rep@@ aired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property probably is considered as not as beautiful part of the walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is too .
the couple had three sons , who survived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fighting with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ erg@@ ers , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive cry , stri@@ fe and floo@@ ds .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the ten@@ ancy agreement was an arrangement of anti@@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in the estate where they were tra@@ ded in the past , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wooden sticks are torn up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neigh@@ bours said that they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall housing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner for this week forc@@ efully by the estate after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to go volunt@@ arily .
the del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neigh@@ bours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were worried about anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today tomorrow we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .

the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the village , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see administ@@ ered the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be fear@@ ful for their neigh@@ bours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , who have been cour@@ ageous to us and have provided us the information .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it w@@ eh@@ tut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stran@@ gely Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals receive nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westph@@ alia may not choose the land tag . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood it .
in 2021 , the country @-@ day election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because stupid than so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land b@@ lasting struggle - that b@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Usedom , Rügen or Hi@@ dden@@ see are not local ones , so don &apos;t choose the land tag .
in addition , there are practical problems : in the vac@@ ations are hel@@ pers to hang up posters , distribute the bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and count them at the end of the voices .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday season , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave the election campaign almost over the people over themselves .
the hot phase when you can say that at all has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be fear@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in p@@ olls clearly behind the CDU . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and has been head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his large posters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he travels through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ okes a little with the people , as it has already done his legendary word @-@ kar@@ ate predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .

on the rapi@@ dity with which the B 27 is soft , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ish .
for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and end at 20 o &apos;clock , there are plenty of praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet Tank@@ stelle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no distortion .
the construction site could be scheduled for half @-@ time at the beginning of the week , until the end of October it will be finished .
this will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of container entran@@ ces .
since the construction site on Monday to the south and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen , and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg , the traffic situation inside the location is relaxed .
the citizens can now run from the B 27 from Of@@ ter@@ dingen back on both sides .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy CEO of the Managing Board Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ satz@@ strasse , Stein@@ laugh@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ mann had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Sch@@ leich@@ wege were seeking and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what led to the fact that some trucks found in residential areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as well as speed limits were not met , the municipality ur@@ ged to rein@@ force the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exagger@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King , who himself made himself on site about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ers at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has gone further , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now is open the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .

however , some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the de@@ aler@@ ship of Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , however , that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the career &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismis@@ sed .
if I had a company with 4000 staff and the half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation , with the reference , the restaurant benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages that arise through the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
it is constantly being screw@@ ed into laws in the name of terrorist control .
according to the latest proposals , Interior Minister of Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the labor@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior at the presentation of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Interior Minister , however , it is on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; realis@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the recent attacks in Wu@@ er@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère has a little time to submit a little time before he presents his conclusions on safety in the Republic .

a lot is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the che@@ ek @-@ coded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , Mai@@ zi@@ ère ki@@ cks a second attempt for proposals to do so far with the SPD : he wants to pick up sympath@@ e@@ ads for terrorist groups under punishment and push ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citiz@@ enship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU &apos;s husband cleared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have partly in themselves : he plans fast methods for dep@@ ortation and more possibilities for keeping people in front of the dep@@ ortation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of di@@ ul@@ sions for asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some more inf@@ erior places than previously , such as those who commit crimes or deliberately reject their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot of them is political and legal .

and at some point - in the im@@ bal@@ ances of pl@@ aque , for example , the question arises : what does this actually mean to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in the face of the high number of refugees , many people also wor@@ r@@ ying about security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that the people were deeply involved , did not let go out in election times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , there are election campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is only a contro@@ vers@@ y about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some of the IL@@ O interior ministers in which R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citiz@@ enship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also blo@@ oms around con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a down@@ turn from the double pass he kept nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have the discussion in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers can return to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion , and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to avoid any damages which have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal in any case , as it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me , while I &apos;m in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and a little more determined , before I ste@@ al my hands and clari@@ fy something like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look on it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at this .
even if the heart of So@@ ho@@ s is slowly gaining in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the building where once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to disable the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , which I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( data : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , ask me ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really appreciate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his room .
the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy than they appeared and again to buy items which he sold when he was young and pl@@ ain@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60 , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably too young to buy them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy boards are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend time , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is my aster .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and promp@@ ted to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I conducted , people usually have been emp@@ tied to their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom on tags of the plate post of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica to recognize that turn@@ around stores offer a so@@ othing community of par@@ ges@@ s .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took off@@ ence on the contact@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar sound platforms , from objects that aw@@ aken happiness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the property of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is with me as a collector so and I think it is so in many people .
it is a simple way to deal with mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pi@@ ped a staff of a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player .
at that point of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I blu@@ eber@@ ry through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of players : three men middle aged ) , has noted a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somebody came just recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more product las@@ tig , less musi@@ cally class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only slowly come from .
F@@ opp , which has devoted to sound plates almost an entire floor , has a lively audience as I am going on .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ agers and women middle age .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester Syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ - und sex@@ ier Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ming from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
no one of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are difficult to imagine when one stands for about 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the panels used for sale .
it is rather a window mannequ@@ in than a purchase .
it does not deserve much , so the collecting of plates is not real option , says she .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a loving sigh@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression , I watch a group of young teen girls who group themselves for a moment to buy Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of plates from Adele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the sector and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards .

French court re@@ jects Offer about demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French dish rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in case of a court hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to provide 72 provis@@ ional shops in which people are selling goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ sers , or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid out of the taxes and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups joined the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported connection and other groups will not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the allocation of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were absolutely understand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , caf@@ és and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas of calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the low @-@ tear was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is used to profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the peti@@ tion to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children was a disaster , of which the young@@ est eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxiliary organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates that the number of people in the jungle has risen to over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals over the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to continue the World Cup in view , remain confident and continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before departure from Rio de Jan@@ eiro at Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s very difficult to comment on the journey of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must analyze in peace , what reasons to de@@ ac@@ ulate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin actually wanted to fight the title at the time of the World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything exactly what we have changed during the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time World Champion , which had lost more than three minutes at Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Fabian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to be set up on the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , among other things in Hesse and Brandenburg , new lighten@@ ing devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic retro@@ fit trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway building sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ poli@@ - there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary sle@@ dge for compliance with speed limitation .
a permanent mobile construction can however be dangerous or complex .

great Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold fet@@ ches gold
the impressive achievement of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji finished a master class in handling , Side @-@ quil@@ ting , back back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal in any colour .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in the shape of this form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .

here they lost only one .
this sl@@ ump will we@@ aken , but progress is amazing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji began mar@@ vell@@ ously , and let the attacks have made up of fun off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell an and Co . , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 up@@ wards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au entered the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right hand he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hard to grasp the ball .

it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still se@@ perate .
so it is also .
GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant cli@@ ent@@ play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ orton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game ran for a long time in favour of the south @-@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and dancing on the tri@@ b@@ une .

Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the coach for a rowing victory
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the appl@@ ause that sat on the rest , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo des Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was omni@@ present at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the Second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who placed on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39.@@ ters un@@ disturbed action , which is likewise exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of weak@@ lings , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on willing hel@@ pers who make the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no more convenient than the coach , who didn &apos;t know whether he would survive this day when cancer was diagnos@@ ed .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnos@@ ed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , causing inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right word under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back again soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 foot , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ stretching morning , spent something more than anything else , trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was as captain of the Royal Artill@@ ery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional w@@ reck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;

Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with their opponents .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to finish , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; blei@@ b in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let go along .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something T@@ oll@@ es .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .

I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new w@@ ells ( 1994 ) , land acqu@@ isitions in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , re@@ construct@@ ing a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the reconstruction of water pipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no stand@@ still standing there , and I have always added new innovations , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their lau@@ d@@ atio , they pra@@ ised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived on the water @-@ purpose association as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practition@@ er , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ gruppe to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Wasser@@ forum of the Lower Fran@@ conia area .

Rupert G@@ öller , on his side , pra@@ ised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a faithful but@@ ler .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described Brun@@ n@@ enbau and the re@@ organisation of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the pipe burst at the high container at Kirch@@ ehr@@ enbach on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained at once , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who enters the succession of Rupert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the police in Lübeck first wanted no information about the aqu@@ ather@@ course or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but they confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deli@@ ri@@ ous deli@@ ri@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the k@@ ris@@ ky exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs .
financial bur@@ dens which are threatened by the branch from the Ö@@ kost@@ rom funding are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energi@@ ew@@ ende in the existing systems for so @-@ called self @-@ flow production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundes@@ minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to use the steel manufacturers , the gases from the high furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to register .
the industry report offers a comprehensive guide to the size and shape of the market at a national level . it provides the latest retail sales data 2009 @-@ 2013 , allowing you to identify the sectors driving growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is now giving a basic certification with the European Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only when generators are replaced in steel mills , all an E@@ EG consumption of 20 percent is applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this will not be lifted in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall gre@@ eted the unification of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel for the steel industry was particularly important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stahl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis of 2008 under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , when the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw China into the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturer design Chinese steel conc@@ er@@ tos price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one show , import oil on import steel has effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secondly , the economic prospects in China are rising . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the German steel industry , around 86@@ ,000 people were busy at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.7 million tonnes of less raw steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Unit split up on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced amount went back to the second month .

the singing was accompanied by her entire life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in teacher education , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in an sen@@ iors choir .

most sen@@ iors singing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
due to regular meetings , sen@@ iors can make social contacts and cultiv@@ ate .
because often social and family structures are often dis@@ solving in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise themselves , to be able to leave and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of compos@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
because the sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled resp@@ i@@ ration .
Originaltitel : CSI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
even though it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seni@@ ors organizations .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or listening of songs in older people aw@@ ak@@ ened many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even de@@ men@@ tia @-@ dise@@ ased people sin@@ ks for long back events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when singing , the head also demands a special achievement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains L@@ enz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will be better and aw@@ ake beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing there are enough .

many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bours can ask for help at the Internet research .
those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has a little liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ ts@@ eral Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee free days before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible moti@@ ves - probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks are not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ rection , or with international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one should rather assume that the bombs of enemies of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have kept secret not@@ ices on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police instruct@@ ed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , there are still small bombs , but they don &apos;t judge tourists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution issued by the jun@@ ta .
the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to ste@@ al chaos , while the country moves towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps himself good to have the Kingdom back to stability and order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting rid of the rebel@@ lion against Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the conflict more than 6,@@ 500 people were killed .
just one year ago , Bangkok was killed by an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most brutal attack of the recent history of the country .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ democratic principle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitution chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ a@@ ßen of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempt to pick her target audience where she stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their target direction and so extreme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is decisive is whether such persons have a lasting influence on the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view to the clear increase of ri@@ pen@@ dic@@ ated crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ a@@ ßen would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be quite obvious that further legal groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugees or attacks from other righ@@ tist @-@ wing moti@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a nation@@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of spelling @-@ ster@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were on the regional level or in social networks .
at the same time , Ma@@ a@@ ßen expressed that many over@@ nights went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes committed before with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected for example CDU , SPD or Linke , who have been radi@@ cally opposed by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethi@@ opia is so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was followed by the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his lap of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place from 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ethi@@ op@@ ians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; got a special start@@ ling by the international swimming association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ @-@ represented countries .
since in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ien most sport@@ s@@ men are running , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ name made the turn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel der W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid newspaper &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he proposed a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of Freest@@ yle , played no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the same with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is offensive for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu , an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to delete her Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they reflect that racial @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y reflect a lack of diversity among the modeling practices of Snap@@ chat .

milit@@ aries of the United States Central Command changed retro@@ spective inform@@ ational information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot , an inquiry committee of the Congress held in a report on Thursday .
the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the military council , intelligence service committees and the military bud@@ get@@ ary report , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how they changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analysis will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the representative house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of US efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government peaks see Obama statements to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as I@@ SIS or I@@ SIL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command reports , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that military con@@ quest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the news reports to play the risk of I@@ SIS in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they have been played that analysts have wor@@ ries about manipulation of reports of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations continue .
in addition , there are further investigations of Cent@@ Com Reports by the Secretary of Defense in the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the republi@@ can task force conclusions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an excessive limited process for the creation of system@@ ic ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ SIL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the top @-@ level democra@@ t in the Kom@@ un@@ ee , a member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of news service reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ cr@@ ats gave no evidence to the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the meetings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by the Pentagon General Director of the Pentagon , which were accepted after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment any reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general insp@@ ector is still in progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that news services and the Ministry of Defense are welcoming a controversial debate on these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the alleg@@ ations of the past year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest evalu@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the critic@@ isms of the anti @-@ Islamic state are remin@@ is@@ cent of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a scrip@@ ture about how the time government under George W. Bush argued against the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew in Iraq , and a little time des@@ erted on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government agencies , states that no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ aging Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation in front of the Senate .
general Austin went retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US is winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before .
a day after three gates were shot during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with Brit@@ ches on the first place that will be unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group .
the first place will take a little longer from the road leading to the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whir@@ l@@ wind by their success story , four years after they land@@ ed at last London Games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the young@@ est in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they did not quali@@ fy for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went on everything .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn the things to better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ am said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t have the work of work in London we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have completely ri@@ pped the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop from the close range .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed himself aston@@ ished and held the console from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and invited the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the heart of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic games are .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel constantly and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and aspi@@ ration .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod that will be served from the b@@ racel@@ ets to the gymn@@ as@@ tics for gymn@@ asts to tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neigh@@ bor in the waiting queu@@ e , without using Simone bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ du@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a Frauen@@ schwar@@ m with dim@@ ples , could have been quite under this known name to be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and charity @-@ TV advertising when he would be a flo@@ ats , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ ist .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ oline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may rule it for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline weather had already been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney , the last 16 years was so anno@@ ying that many of those I had asked , didn &apos;t know that it &apos;s an Olympic game at all .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ oline , and until 2012 has made an ath@@ l@@ ete who managed to reach the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans to share them for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline ladder has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ ns@@ way than the Olympic games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ onist trem@@ ors of his never @-@ ending rebel@@ lion - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and dive , which combines two kinds of sports that basically un@@ ites .
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means much like &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
ambitious winners jump on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 foot into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ash and sal@@ tos ) before they landing on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they will be rated according to the official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; olymp@@ ic program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the design , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common olymp@@ ic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to move to gold in their quest to gold , faster , up@@ wards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and back , up@@ wards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also in television transmission also another poli@@ te goal : the world or the Olympic Games .
the targeted pur@@ suit is no@@ bel , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it &apos;s also that which I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when looking at these games .
please evaluate the features of the product ( i.e. , workmanship ) .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no w@@ ah in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and end@@ ings of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final wounds as part of a after@@ no@@ ir block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a peaceful , nice moment , one that will probably over@@ look the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by creating a male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts recently swal@@ lowed the The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awa@@ its its air channel , new fan community .

demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethi@@ opia are non @-@ violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that sevent@@ y prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in shot changes .
is Ethi@@ opia just inter@@ fer@@ ing with it ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ aken the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people sle@@ pt on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .

witnesses reported that police killed dozens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the UN Human Rights Authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands a preliminary investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even be more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethi@@ opia is the most popul@@ ated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethi@@ opia to combat terrorism over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethi@@ opia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ulum train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethi@@ opia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued repression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , and dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to ex@@ ile or in prison , or driven into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ at , a lectur@@ er in central Ethi@@ opia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole youth prot@@ ested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from floor use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely cri@@ tici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the ten@@ sions rise along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts advoc@@ ate that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ ro@@ mo liberation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced to explo@@ it the turbul@@ ence over the last few years , could explo@@ it the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of injuries are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smart phones .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing in regular intervals , especially among protests , many people can still communicate over Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are stopped .
several young Ethi@@ op@@ ians told them that they were assembled for protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethi@@ opia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since e@@ ons prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high @-@ countries from Ethi@@ opia , in politics and economy while they explo@@ it the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in shallow areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are involved in co @-@ ordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethi@@ opia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which are around 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 , 17 years in Ethi@@ opia &apos;s Prime Minister .
he was seen as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly appreciated in taking up early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and use special officers to deal with enemies and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethi@@ opia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of North Korea , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time Ethi@@ opia experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested against elections which were apparently confused by the government , and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts pra@@ ised Ethi@@ opia leader for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new pend@@ ulum train , as well as for its meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethi@@ opian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in G@@ ond@@ ar , an am@@ bush city , managed by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming ever more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position .
the American government used Ethi@@ opia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbouring Somalia , even if they have recently concluded that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to collapse its ally in a already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin cross @-@ walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama called I@@ SIS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday , indicating that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fellow allies who strive to protect him during an event@@ ful period in protection , in the peculi@@ ar position to explain statements which he could not have meant .
after having made the suggestion for an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was in relation to the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created I@@ SIS .

the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he attempted to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling demand .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic .

at the end of July he pulled heavily critic@@ ised as he thought the Russians should h@@ ew Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s emails , but he explained later , &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then rest upon request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he is cle@@ ver@@ ly enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an et@@ ched tone , as his survey figures continued .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday showed a lead with great advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that Obama I@@ SIS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it back ben@@ ches , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled out the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream republi@@ can attempt to argue that the government served as a Foreign Minister , allowing I@@ SIS to spread the situation in the Middle East , aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and asked them to rest on each of his words and to be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he h@@ ated the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ cr@@ ats mo@@ cked about Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s exc@@ use than just another proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point is back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a certified café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years , good coffee was served for 15 years .

a re@@ vival Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing collabor@@ ator of the old caf@@ es , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ es .

after having closed the b , she had a coffee bowl for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that there was a coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b that fell on me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal client since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and was inevitably always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came a quarter to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything B@@ agel with butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rodri@@ guez said that he did not think that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of Soap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bo@@ iled coffee of caf@@ es as ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there is a chance that the café is expanding on a neighbouring building .

this centre of the eye lens is already formed before the birth of the hair , which is no longer renewed in it .

in case of a complaint on Thursday , U.S. District Apostle Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gil@@ ead is entitled to release the costs inc@@ urred during the defence of the F@@ ALL .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alize the market for a new generation of hep@@ atitis C medicines which can heal over 90 percent of patients suffering from liver disease .

con@@ d@@ oms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ de , fire@@ able bodies promote dance ani@@ as eleph@@ ant protection
natural sho@@ ots in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to popul@@ ated sett@@ lements - they throw con@@ d@@ oms to them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ffs .
the method has proved to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already been the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its funding by developing volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and harv@@ ests without inj@@ ecting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Human Rights dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change of their attitude within these communities , whereby they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without harm the eleph@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps com@@ prise the lights of the eleph@@ ant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not dep@@ orted , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end to the ignition is rot@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is lighted , the con@@ dom bur@@ ns up with a bang and gives fine dust to chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des into the air .
a touch is usually already out to hunt the eleph@@ ant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director cerem@@ onies Berlin hotel because Israeli re@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots has unle@@ ashed a media rebel@@ lion after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel Bri@@ sto@@ l Hotel in Berlin has not listed any Israeli election since there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allowed his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ sto@@ l Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and cleared ?
I wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bri@@ sto@@ l also offers an opportunity to select Israel via their own call centre .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer which he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was the director even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Ara@@ bs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was c@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambass@@ ador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident solved a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet , where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged invitation to Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a syn@@ agog@@ ue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Israel did not enter into the high@@ land list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade between Russia and Iran suddenly asc@@ ends up to 71 % - RT business &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambass@@ ador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teh@@ eran in comparison to 70,@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest of Russian companies in shops in the country grew strongly , the ambass@@ ador communic@@ ated .
Russian companies accept existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 70,@@ 9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was reached by ship@@ ments of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambass@@ ador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation gave around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something , from which the ambass@@ ador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Per@@ sian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home than Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the male team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself an E@@ igen .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they reiter@@ ated the trick when it took place in March at the subway world champion@@ ships in London despite the retreat of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ du .

Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a Olympics ord , but in the stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ ins the New Zealand won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy shift made a large part of the transformation , when passing in a higher ais@@ le , to slow it down and to allow it to be Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name .
we have set up an olymp@@ ic ord in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbeliev@@ able .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page , he noticed that he fell on the track after a weak start .
he passed this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection by the Engli@@ sh@@ man ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time did not have such a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels all the GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we are so badly affected with so many world titles that it was unbeliev@@ able to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if that &apos;s a barometer of our progress in the last five months we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of the furniture that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23rd March ( a apparently holy date for British Sports ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .

it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .

the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a matter of fact , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - stand on the game , as the plant operator can termin@@ ate the supply contract and thereby increase all supply contracts as the supplying energy companies ha@@ vo@@ iced .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .

up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be end@@ anger@@ ed at a closure .
in addition , there could be domain effects since the mel@@ ting dairy consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ked a closing .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last@@ ly due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ mel@@ ess with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller por@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to continue operating in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by mel@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company communic@@ ated with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L is assuming that contracts in the fiscal year 17 are to contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong termin@@ ology for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L informed that the value of contracts already declined in the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect@@ ation of a termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capacity Alco@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate the mel@@ ting mill or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

analy@@ st war@@ ns due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the port of mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume about 600 Meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ ausgabe of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Liby@@ an era began .
Kend@@ rick &apos;s big sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for himself .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most popular issue of the year .

the Director of the Munici@@ p@@ alities of Que@@ bec@@ q James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without a cancellation of the decision of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s common law centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive deb@@ ts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this collection reveals that they cannot receive the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of hel@@ pers need to be forced out of Que@@ ens@@ land , with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for the general federal prosec@@ utor and Federal Employment Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these central short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provin@@ cial government fulfilled its comm@@ it@@ ments to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to view the needs of the community centers and their client communities , as well as that the government of Pal@@ asz@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .

new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ activity after being informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February had directed a gun to a staff while traveling in a Je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indi@@ ct@@ ment which was submitted on Wednesday in the provin@@ cial court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program for the campaign in this state .
Bord@@ ini gave some months waiting for months that the matter would be regulated intern@@ ally before he realised that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , laid his right hands on the pull , and ra@@ mmed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kne@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Bord@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini found that at least four other persons had already made the same experience with Philli@@ p , he admitted in the indi@@ ct@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to tigh@@ ten damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Bord@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indi@@ ct@@ ment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he said of a crowd in North Carolina , said that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ waff@@ en@@ land@@ lords and weapons fans should take measures if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton would be elected and judges .
Tr@@ umps campaign made clear that the media would have torn his words out of the context and that he would not increase violence .
B@@ ord@@ is complaint demands compensation for damages from the campaign for breach of due di@@ ligence and by Philip due to body injury and lasting psychological damage .

the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a couple of euros , lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they origin@@ ate from the stone age of the internet ages .
but before 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ v@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot of SMS and emails sent and received , even by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .

permanent enrich@@ ment is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; England needs to direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row &quot; &quot; &quot;
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country , renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will have 10,000 new appren@@ tices , 40@@ ,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
it was said that England will never be ready for the games and that we are bl@@ aming on the stage of the world stage .
the two were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answered any question asked him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single a infrastructure project .
enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , creating £ 211 billion on wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the whole GB .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is also one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to which England can be proud of .

the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are calling for witnesses after a woman passed in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman put himself in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , which was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some still have not been identified , the police said that as well as any witnesses of the incident , the police said .
it was opened up a preliminary investigation , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Cour@@ st@@ etter informed the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a colli@@ sion avo@@ idable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the Prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver does not need to be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - with which one person in the Dun@@ klen was running on the highway - it was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian was running in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder after having passed a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has been un@@ conscious on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the police responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predi@@ ctable situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NAS@@ A climate models : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhabited by the proj@@ ections of a new NAS@@ A climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NAS@@ A developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of clim@@ atic researchers .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have been referred to similar conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that the Venus had a thin , er@@ ect @-@ like atmosphere , but slowly moving slowly .
the model illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but had once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus was exp@@ on@@ ated for nearly two months &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io declared in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a story of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously assumed by plan@@ etary scientists .
although they were pres@@ um@@ ably inhab@@ itable , the Venus was subjected to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oc@@ eans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .

alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year Roy in an opinion .
in the course of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination with decisions that affect the performance of the team .

we appreciate all what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the clusters of ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates below the stars of the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help to understand astronom@@ ers why stars in clusters are rotating at different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational periods with planet creation arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that we through comparing our results with other clusters , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clusters of the Ple@@ j@@ ades are 445 light years removed from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you are turning right now on the quick@@ est way .
at peak rates , these stra@@ pping stars run large amounts of star dis@@ appearing .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by reco@@ gnis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more mas@@ si@@ ly stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby bigger stars turn slower than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare different qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still a lot more than we would like to learn more about how , how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates , so to speak their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which soon will appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .

Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a good ath@@ l@@ ete would have won a medal .
in front of the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing incidents have become known in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle courses in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ wich@@ th@@ eber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tici@@ zed lightweight athle@@ tics cont@@ ests come to this news .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ othi@@ azi@@ de has been proven over the last Sunday , which is used as a cas@@ cade drug for dop@@ ing substances .
the international sports court of CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 year old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0,@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the lead over 50 m of Freest@@ yle .
during the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B trial and a hearing is requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national federation took the matter seriously and requires Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court in CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa reported that the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the correct conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , about all weight lifting from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation may not participate in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested three days earlier on an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ andro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both best riding the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .

it st@@ owed on the reverse road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that is to change : the rule of law should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the traffic on the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam when they drive via the Zu@@ br@@ inger motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road construction continues on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße at 700 metres .
drivers can then take the right from the hammer onto the right .
the major advantage : the traffic is divided into early , thereby improving the overall course of the variable part of the Federal Road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
on week@@ days the back@@ yard is enough to bridge over the Alber@@ kro@@ on track and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle pipe on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is guided only one track via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ built in front of a well @-@ thir@@ teen years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer owns the necessary load capacity , in order to accommodate the heavy duty traffic two @-@ lane rop@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected industry will continue , the competent regional operation cannot say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , with years to be expected , the bridge has an official resi@@ dual time period up to 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state of the country has deliberately sought the traffic weaker times in the school holidays because with dis@@ abilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic is passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years were the st@@ aging in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association offers the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German .
with the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video anim@@ ations , it was possible to follow the course of course , thus the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ erberg of Spra@@ kel , and the boy Theater will work in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December yo@@ ungst@@ ers will be offered the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , play and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language training are planning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;

what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there is also analysis of non @-@ store ret@@ ailing : v@@ ending ; hom@@ esh@@ opping ; internet ret@@ ailing ; direct selling , as available .
not rare is the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake up is often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly in depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , who has a disc choice , can &apos;t lie , wake up every two to three hours , and it cat@@ ches to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and wor@@ ries , for example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one go with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?

imp@@ air@@ ment can be quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ loaded , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical dis@@ comfort as gast@@ ric or head@@ ache .
to re@@ lie@@ ve sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , including behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quiries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there are hardly any serious sleep medi@@ ators , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why you should first turn to the house doctor if you want to sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied by exam@@ ining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for the study in the sleep laboratory medicine , for example , in case of s@@ nor@@ ing with respir@@ atory tra@@ ct , in case of mal@@ ign@@ ant daily ti@@ red@@ ness , for sleeping transform@@ ers or if one doesn &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only do not make lun@@ atic sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are quite a lot of screws where you can apply for a better sleep .
we@@ ther counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , not watching television for sleeping , alcohol , and at night not watch the watch - then you begin to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s quite un@@ fortunate .

&quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den@@ b@@ ushes , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which should soon be demoli@@ shed , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , pre@@ fers with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents have occupied ten@@ ants , but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator H@@ enkel was pronounced several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rou@@ elled the police for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the street and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and building workers went under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
in this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents go walking with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jana * , who gener@@ alizes here three children , are gener@@ v@@ ated mainly by police presence .
with the residents of the building projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wants to bring about a majority of police protection from the v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tren@@ ches , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police set up between houses and their neigh@@ bours , does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which also today compared to the rest of the city , has a lower average and high poverty risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost all the Main@@ zer Straße very close to Riga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer has been cleared up under a large police officer in a regular street battle , many of the projects in Riga have been leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied for 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and suff@@ er@@ ers from all over the world : now people from G@@ DR times and former houses are now sharing their Kie@@ z .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
many of the newly built buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they are recogni@@ z@@ able in designed windows or freshly painted faç@@ ades that were subjected to colour bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned as often as often with words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for this is that not all neigh@@ bours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the criminal off@@ ences make serious damage , which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ ful : people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bours , who were not this .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can find one another , lives together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and has remained .
this is why it was also so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the city in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by scre@@ ened new@@ buildings in former construction sites that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it takes time and makes it useful to bridge over time , for example with language courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who feel the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach cannot work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is always also to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : have the two of the most recent incidents of fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer is quite clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could not be excluded and does not want to exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sensitive , but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would be happy to stay in Ur@@ bach .
thus , the main and honor@@ ary official on site and in the region are to look for activities .
it is always in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question is clear to answer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the policy is afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived at Ur@@ bach , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
