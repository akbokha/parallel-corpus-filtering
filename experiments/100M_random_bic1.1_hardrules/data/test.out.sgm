<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of engineering craftsmanship from a truly epic dimension in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate work which requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total there are almost 79% of the total bridge deck on their place and the last section of the deck is now getting in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first cap in each bridge project represents a considerable milestone.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high-performance and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern part of the shelter 700 millimeters in the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate work.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up by approx. 3% upwards.</seg>

<seg id="4">And secondly: this crew has three Turnerinnen, Simone biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>

<seg id="11">People who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The study of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole LONGSON, Director of the NICE Health Policy Research Center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor is in combination with aspirin effective in reducing additional heart attacks and impact attacks in people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a preliminary recommendation by Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand the available treatment options for thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and worms of a serious testing - by using some of the most dirty and ecstworthy places in Europe able.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his course on a Euro ticket, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a tensile toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to swallow the sink of a tensile toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others may be totally absurd, but actually in a kitchen rinse more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate unique and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to railway stations to flushing knitting of toilets, the task set out its immune system definitely under a trial</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film, he told:" "" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test finish showed a luminometer speed of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometers are freshly washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after her Luminometers were more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film, he says," "" "That's the worst thing I have in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty than that!</seg>

<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led back Brainstormings that ended with that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of discussing the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added:" "" "let's say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had spared some of the things I had instructed him, like the ecologically Russian toilette shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things when it was easier to put Ian to leak them and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>

<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me, while I'm in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and a little more determined, before I steal my hands and clarify something like: "so, let's take a closer look on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly gaining in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the building where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (data: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I really appreciate it," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy than they appeared and again to buy items which he sold when he was young and plainly.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late 60, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably too young to buy them" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy boards are rather introverted and likes to spend time, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and prompted to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I conducted, people usually have been emptied to their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on tags of the plate post of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that turnaround stores offer a soothing community of pargess.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took offence on the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar sound platforms, from objects that awaken happiness.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector so and I think it is so in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "piped a staff of a plate stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that point of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I blueberry through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of players: three men middle aged), has noted a "trophy aspect" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "somebody came just recently here and said," "" "I don't have a record player but I'd like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf." "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product lastig, less musically class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only slowly come from.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted to sound plates almost an entire floor, has a lively audience as I am going on.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts neuester Synthesizer- und sexier Pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to imagine when one stands for about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of the panels used for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a window mannequin than a purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so the collecting of plates is not real option, says she.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a loving sighing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression, I watch a group of young teen girls who group themselves for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the sector and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumps through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they steer the stubborn look of an unheimliche, 30-year-old countertenor who climbs nothing on the shoulders of the middle age over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French dish rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a court hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to provide 72 provisional shops in which people are selling goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressers, or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid out of the taxes and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups joined the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported connection and other groups will not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive achievement of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji finished a master class in handling, Side-quilting, back back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal in any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in the shape of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>

<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell an and Co., as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau entered the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right hand he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hard to grasp the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tip: type in a part of the name, a few characters is enough.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a Touchdown and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the reanpfiff and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak tactics of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still seperate.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant clientplay by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game ran for a long time in favour of the south-seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags and dancing on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame deposed the i-Tüpfelchen with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>

<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the buks in the first half to the front but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footprint and achieved a gate under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling rider by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-inch team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="7">Most seniors singing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to regular meetings, seniors can make social contacts and cultivate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures are often dissolving in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>

<seg id="14">Even though it's about getting the sound of the voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that the singing or listening of songs in older people awakened many memories, often associated with positive emotions of their youth.</seg>

<seg id="20">At the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I have long for something, I will be better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>

<seg id="2">Militaries of the United States Central Command changed retrospective informational information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot, an inquiry committee of the Congress held in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The provisional report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the military council, intelligence service committees and the military budgetary report, reported of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how they changed their assessments to US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government peaks see Obama statements to change the reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their predecessors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>

<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, there are further investigations of CentCom Reports by the Secretary of Defense in the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the republican task force conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an excessive limited process for the creation of systemic assessments to ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "gave the top-level democrat in the Komunee, a member of the representative house Adam B.

<seg id="27">The allegations of the past year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest evaluations of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticisms of the anti-Islamic state are reminiscent of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a scripture about how the time government under George W. Bush argued against the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew in Iraq, and a little time deserted on the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in insurrection against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, states that no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>

<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may rule it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline weather had already been a olympic event since 2000, when it was in Sydney, the last 16 years was so annoying that many of those I had asked, didn't know that it's an Olympic game at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline, and until 2012 has made an athlete who managed to reach the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share them for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline ladder has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clownsway than the Olympic games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonist tremors of his never-ending rebellion - but also the grazie of gymnastics and dive, which combines two kinds of sports that basically unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means much like "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ambitious winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 foot into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hash and saltos) before they landing on their feet.</seg>

<seg id="26">Medallists have to move to gold in their quest to gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes and back, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also in television transmission also another polite goal: the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also that which I feel fatigued when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">Please evaluate the features of the product (i.e., workmanship).</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent... and unmarked!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wah in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant uplifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and endings of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>

<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-Manie, they promise a peaceful, nice moment, one that will probably overlook the general tumult.</seg>

<seg id="24">The two youngest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that resemble those of climatic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have been referred to similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus had a thin, erect-like atmosphere, but slowly moving slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminates the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but had once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of the Venus was exponated for nearly two months" "", "GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio declared in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a story of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were presumably inhabitable, the Venus was subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="26">For the study in the sleep laboratory medicine, for example, in case of snoring with respiratory tract, in case of malignant daily tiredness, for sleeping transformers or if one doesn't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>

<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the residents have occupied tenants, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel was pronounced several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area as "No-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadmiths, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrouelled the police for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, locked parts of the street and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and building workers went under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go walking with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects, there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who generalizes here three children, are genervated mainly by police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the building projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>

<seg id="19">"" "" "" "while the Mainzer has been cleared up under a large police officer in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga have been legalized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied for 26 years ago." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and sufferers from all over the world: now people from GDR times and former houses are now sharing their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newly built buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognizable in designed windows or freshly painted façades that were subjected to colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned as often as often with words" "" "left-autonomous violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for this is that not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the criminal offences make serious damage, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rented house next to the controversial 94, can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weightful: people in the 94 are their neighbours, who were not this.</seg>

<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was also so important that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by screened newbuildings in former construction sites that push the old inhabitants.</seg>
