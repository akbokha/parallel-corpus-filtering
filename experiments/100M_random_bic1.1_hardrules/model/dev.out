Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu with Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two states discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and casts Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the deal struck by Obama about Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress which was partly as an aff@@ ront of Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting was rejected with regard to the election of the upcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was linked to a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I loved Amy and she is the only woman I loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who spent two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lynn Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took life when the police interven@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to gain a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details provided by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state have been published , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he shared the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , some inc@@ lin@@ ations were too proble@@ matic behavi@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something with him wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes told him that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .

this year , he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michael J. Fox def@@ ends his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre on the roy@@ als , and I noticed that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simulated sus@@ pen@@ se and a Ar@@ mes@@ et length of it , with the princ@@ ess of Wales at a date .

&quot; &quot; &quot; UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ Moon says its response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN chief challenges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integ@@ rative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Meeting to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the events in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey read@@ ings show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls presented Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts empha@@ size that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led to the rising of Herman Engel , of which none of them won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but foreign groups such as Je@@ b Bush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps stam@@ ina and start to let their dollar flow to over@@ throw it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :

on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ ying &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans don &apos;t see the tem@@ per temper@@ ament as a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ult@@ ing statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers believe that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the first state of the nation state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ law , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers acc@@ ustom themselves to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put up their mou@@ ths , republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time when four from ten end of July put their money to Je@@ b Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est cryst@@ als in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .

but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has harv@@ ested the majority support .

of course , a lot has happened to change that , and no one can really say to never change the opinion .

in his 28 hit match in the Champions League for Bavaria leaders , Müller received good help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had to pass a head of the World Champion as a Flan@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm had promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich @-@ held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up @-@ up @-@ ups with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they went mu@@ tig , in their offensive effort , but often too inv@@ inci@@ ble to work .
the attacks were often initiated by playing sites on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k came out of the right hem@@ isph@@ ere in the left upper gate .

the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth early in order to lose the 2,5@@ - to 3,6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had watched more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of dental loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ F@@ E .
for these peri@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the cor@@ relation between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore caused by frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , researchers in the Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the end@@ anger@@ ing is back to the level of non @-@ smoking , first author Thomas Dietrich from the British University of Birmingham .

archae@@ ologists come across the Rhine river bank on rem@@ n@@ ants from late anti@@ quity

in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historical buildings were excav@@ ated , said Museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .

in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a gra@@ vey@@ ard with about 350 gra@@ ves , which probably belonged to the church .

Poroshenko to speak at UN General Assembly meeting dedicated to large movements of refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission has suggested a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for def@@ ending the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private sh@@ atter@@ ing equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which is clearly more traditional in its way of operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de promised to introduce the European negoti@@ ation position to the US free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XHTML 1.1 plus Math@@ ML 2.0 XHTML 1.1 plus Math@@ ML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1 Math@@ ML 2.0 SVG 1.0 SVG 1.1 SVG 1.1 Tiny SVG 1.1 Basic S@@ MIL 1.0 S@@ MIL 2.0
by T@@ TIP , the largest free trade zone in the world is to develop with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures have shown that the EU states and the US are jointly selecting independent judges for a new Investment Tribunal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to impose obj@@ ection against jud@@ g@@ ments .
until now , the proceedings of the proceedings were united with each other on arbit@@ rators , a claim for obj@@ ection against their jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment firm according to their own specifications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there could also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial justi@@ fication which allows companies to pursue damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws and en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act marked the proposals by the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Economic State Secretary of State Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as big progress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considers essential points to be taken into consideration by the Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is of the table .
the French government also gre@@ eted the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against restri@@ cting the opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when discussing the free trade agreement T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations run since mid @-@ 2013 .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ gest@@ unde
firm of the Year for Private Construction Luther Firm of the Year for Energy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will be his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ n@@ aires and set up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour ME@@ Ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the cabinet minister and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision on Tuesday was prov@@ oked by a commem@@ orative ceremony on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony commem@@ or@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tically prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several Tit@@ els@@ ets @-@ Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ns has attracted attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party initially supported him as a leader .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour sector , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , suggest@@ ing Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow workers and pensions secretary , that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , who has since been T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy set , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Isl@@ ington North MP stated that the Fra@@ gest@@ ed Prime Minister is too confront@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; impact &quot; and the stri@@ fe with contradictions , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to talk that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he asked John Ber@@ man , the spokes@@ man of the House of House , to discuss the problem .
when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ The@@ aters , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
as they were first sent on television in 1990 , the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of House and his position under his parliam@@ ents , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ marsch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ alers of Met@@ cash has launched a so@@ aring campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump abo@@ ard , with brands such as ice manufacturer Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops and sell shop owners to sell tickets for the South Australian football le@@ ague to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy .
it is much at stake because South Australia and Western Australia reach almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di 12 months after the opening of its first markets will take away some five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retail@@ er sales .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath estimates that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million revenues per year and cash of € 250 million by the end of 2016 .

the loss in the food and food business and the amount of fixed cost base could cost the cash ratio of around 13 million dollars from interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .

last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass told the founder of the Magellan Financial Group , with a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of the company of Met@@ cash has received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ sian Food and Food Trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction in simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler w@@ akes up and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to improve sales prices with col@@ es and wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and I@@ GA retail@@ er stores faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private label foods .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves praise for his own behavior after the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; ri@@ dden by the not@@ orious confront@@ ation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with Stan W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ote a tennis bat after a cra@@ mp@@ f reduced a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was def@@ ended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am rather jeal@@ ous about me is the fact that after my view of Th@@ an@@ asi a little bit entered into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp@@ ing in the US Open , but he is not the first player , who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he is extremely good in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves much recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe he was a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on he has never been a problem with the other players , he will be respected in changing areas , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged according to his own services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os to take into account the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to a long @-@ term permanent part in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; firstly , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has made the as@@ cen@@ sion to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some simple mistakes and deser@@ ves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions .

chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who fled to violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helic@@ opter was ho@@ ver@@ ing over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sh@@ rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian defense police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some referred to protest food@@ stu@@ ffs and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary will be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be conversations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels could not agree on common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people , seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation on Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could un@@ lock roads and speed asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plane the construction of a barb@@ ed wire along his border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ails were used to create barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a huge bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a considerable bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entrance to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that led the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the application of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people know when trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come up by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of crimes against the new laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a draw@@ bridge with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders .
chaos reign@@ ed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and pressing a crowd to push back there .
about 20 succeeded in coming , but thousands of people remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a mysti@@ cal ritu@@ als of a student joint in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation into the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police said .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go on a frozen field to a goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the National President of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of hiding tools began to hide and set the benefit of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not revi@@ ve , and he died in the next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County &apos;s Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indi@@ ct@@ ment due to Mor@@ des third gra@@ des for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of panic attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has officially or officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , we will also draw it to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the br@@ otherhood , and the national Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local community .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a interest rate comes , and the house is dis@@ cour@@ aged , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will gli@@ de into a rec@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only low guidance for the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rec@@ ession came after only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ siv@@ ity of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal levels , but still at low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that seem to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view of historic trends based on how some areas of economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the increase of interest rates can make things for a while volati@@ le .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are apparently a tendency that assets amounts to 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a new study to what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 per cent - on the way to Interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days after average profit after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , boss plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the er@@ tion cycle and the return on investment will begin to decrease .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is being confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist before and which could speed up a rec@@ ession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and disc@@ ard the question whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants responded to a interest rate of the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a lik@@ eli@@ hood of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the poli@@ shing cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the BI@@ P and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ ew very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
in bonds the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering is done in the cycle .
at the end of the end of the cycle , the bond thick@@ ens fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in closer ties between longer and shorter loans and lead to a breakdown of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest rates often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stri@@ ving monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the earnings trend is flat , credit ten@@ sions have expanded and the volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in the large and full company , companies that wrap up the larger part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and become more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts will be worse , as an increasing dollar represents their products on the global market and also the financing of their deb@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have a weak balance sheet after each of the net interest rates 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , above 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity with their shares also exceeded the average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts will be a big problem .

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament board Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does anything that does not do the private person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham and the BBC bos@@ ses , said that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foo@@ lish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be just under another name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously @-@ called examples in which you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works on behalf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to engage the audience when it did this in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire , entered the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .

dear readers , as these audi@@ ob@@ ooks are in German , it simply does not make sense to translate them into any other language .
the proc@@ ession took place at the Sacred Place , where only days before a construction crane came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the ends .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of the bin Laden , because of the cat@@ astrophe that left 394 injured , a san@@ ction .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dec@@ ors who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Zone of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , was the father of four children who fell on his first pilgri@@ mage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ le in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ Official have already said that the H@@ add@@ ington will continue to be in Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden Group did not have to stand the arm of the sick when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decre@@ e published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man laugh@@ ed to reveal what caused the over@@ throw of the sick , which fell into an inner courtyard of the large mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims fled before the H@@ add@@ sch , who later this month , gathered themselves together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has no statements on the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ oured the group due to not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with mete@@ or@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the slave family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger building projects .
the late leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a ab@@ rup@@ tible son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgri@@ mage voy@@ age that is required at least once in the life of each sound Proof .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government representatives ordered 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to the members of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured .
other injured will receive half of this amount .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this accus@@ ation has been legally av@@ eng@@ ed in May in May . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the Attor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffle had emerged in the preliminary investigation , the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were the funds of associations that were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
firm of the Year for Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Cli@@ ff@@ ord Chance

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this F@@ akt@@ um , the Chair@@ woman of the Sl@@ ava Department , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the un@@ fai@@ th@@ fully laid down the defence , that the association was not an asset in any time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport function@@ aries had only paid expenses and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the deb@@ ts - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we continue or lock the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put money to put our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the purchase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no deb@@ ts can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of corresponding financial results , the withdrawal of the expense compensation was determined retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a part of the expense claims was only years later , starting from 2003 when a plus was paid to the account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Pau@@ lus@@ - and non @-@ detail bookings said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounts and scar@@ fs administ@@ ered the two def@@ endants together , said the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the out@@ flow of the association has not been revealed in detail , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the financial sponsor@@ ship , but it is important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the club account in 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the def@@ endants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to his statement to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of that money , the Prosec@@ utor made in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ aries were right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation claims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rich@@ terin and Attor@@ ney General . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first def@@ endant explained that he did not agree with this wording because the association was never created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never had a cent in salary , he was only a mil@@ eage allow@@ ance and di@@ eting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Di@@ et , he charged 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
precise documentation for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are after an audit , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer has been kept , they explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
kilomet@@ re money was also related to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the Beh@@ eb@@ ungen are in cash , for that he has to go to the bank of his residence of international market to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time ever since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists ques@@ tioned by Reuters was found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will still remain a bit longer and interest rates at the current status of 0 - 0,25 % .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Leit@@ ender Employ@@ ee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ lli@@ on dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ cking outlook on global conditions .

&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he was shot his colleagues on the day and killed - wrote Sh@@ annon Lamb a note to say that it &apos;s &quot; pity &quot; at the first murder and wanted to do it , &quot; he couldn &apos;t do it , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , said the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said , he shot on someone and killed anyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said to the staff of emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not exist .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as police the scene looked , she found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 which said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb had 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was given by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married approximately seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who was 19 , and they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .

the police said , Lamb had called for a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to the forest , and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doct@@ orate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his life &apos;s life on the university &apos;s website .

Luke Shaw suffered in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven with double fra@@ cture of his right leg .
in Termin@@ ator : S.@@ C.@@ C. ( TV ) ( Originaltitel : Termin@@ ator : Sarah Con@@ nor Chronicles ( TV ) )
the injury was caused by a retro@@ spective attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Shaw entered into the PSV area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has a double leg fra@@ cture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then is fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing cabin , he had an oxygen mask .

I am not a doctor , but if you have a double t@@ inc@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ oven .

if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it is a very simple violation , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in another direction so that it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided to call for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 environmental label founded in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the Super@@ Camp@@ s company , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead contains an ingredient of the film version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the city of the city of Th@@ ink @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets the girl of his dreams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reads her desire to see a real tree , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was named Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if this is not a susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the enc@@ ir@@ cled city of Th@@ ink @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although he is giving a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy , such as the local environment , sounds like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , trees trun@@ c@@ ated , Th@@ ink stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck , schn@@ ur@@ r@@ ty being , &quot; that is in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax did not read for 20 times a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s el@@ ect .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still hard
on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has selected for the tour , a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s page is perhaps less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing @-@ list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test plane , is an option for the attack .
this is related news : Adam Ly@@ th schei@@ det from the UK test @-@ cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to permit Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are gear@@ ed towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their best sel@@ ections .

the UK @-@ trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss pra@@ ised his post@@ ure , even if he did not get so good performance , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .

he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
it must be at least the same chances as they get before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .

I don &apos;t see why a dr@@ ummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ hand has already shown that he is a Devil &apos;s Devil of Cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een has perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Long played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he completed three hundred races immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari came into the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning drivers that lift their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made a few clever additions to the train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played all the conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has views of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the news is in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ y Team@@ kol@@ lege at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Root received a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said that some member states are deeply embro@@ iled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own fault , Britain itself created an agenda with split conc@@ es@@ sions and distur@@ bing contractual changes , which they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as with the excessive long wa@@ ver@@ ing such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ b@@ age ( 16 ) .

Poland probably soon became a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg out to help the sel@@ fie @-@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they do not want because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally do not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tre@@ ati@@ se was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the new tre@@ ati@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of press photos , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .

in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ aner than Blair himself when he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s lecture theatre , because Blair had rejected the principle of the failed Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened a rear door .

it may take , but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .

&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin McK@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liver@@ pool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that E cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed examination of evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ crit@@ erion decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager had previously received by British American Tobacco Product ( B@@ AT ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the B@@ AT &apos;s references to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which include a number of sectors funding in the paper .
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
in the session the Tobacco management of PH@@ E took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testi@@ fies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that E cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of E cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what proof proves , and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ a year .
the clear predomin@@ ance of current evidence that E cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .

the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals were given their right hand &quot; for Hit Shows like Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they would probably be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial tim@@ pan@@ i against the most popular shows of their rival and broadcasting such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Manager , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broad@@ ened , which would also clearly demonstrate un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the top @-@ house communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the radio fee , what I consider medi@@ - or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least put your production at least on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a top @-@ not@@ ch time window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to see how this should be public @-@ right TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would decrease BBC at all .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts in the BBC give this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh staged in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 because they do not measure their tasks , and they can argue when they go on their apparent missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion pounds , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window , where no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value from this .
of course , you think of all that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot , ask me whether this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday said that the BBC should review its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and it should be an example for the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
for the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have b@@ red wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically altered nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they have sound impul@@ ses that have high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard .
the impul@@ ses work by switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically altered to wear the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
read more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an inv@@ asive procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ultr@@ as@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ as@@ ound waves act on structures which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the gl@@ ands cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these icons channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultr@@ as@@ ound on the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transmit into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves tissue can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily stimulate the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
for eleven years ago , I went to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most I &apos;ve learned can be di@@ still@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence is easy to ner@@ ves up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ear : people tell wh@@ ence you come , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you are in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are hon@@ est@@ ly told Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your las@@ hes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks recipes , film night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people attract and anticip@@ ate their under@@ wear .
this is related to this : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtain a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a sanctuary , but many student resi@@ den@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ space st@@ roll culture , which can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continue , but you have to go away so that I keep the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow milit@@ ant is exhau@@ sted - and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos terminals : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ ek .
as you start the university at the high point of back @-@ man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people is to introduce themselves with a plate of brow@@ nies , less stran@@ gely than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have a bit of baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made goo@@ dies are a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat lead to people to sleep when you anchor .
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the owner &apos;s owner .
the chances are good that they say to self @-@ serve themselves even if they cook in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to cope with it as my ro@@ om@@ mates who added a jar to their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighb@@ ors , if there was something out of them to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighb@@ ors were kindly invited to sleep for two hours before she sle@@ pt her own music , closed her door and beg@@ ged for her three hour test .
would it not be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse is random@@ ly drawn into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be deeply embar@@ rass@@ ed if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner to go back and see it every day and maybe with how to bring together all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try at least to talk to your subordin@@ ate a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its non @-@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer appears as it seems .
a good st@@ allion is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
hur@@ ry you through hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which you put into the freezer - but do not shake their pos@@ sessions at the ceiling no more than twice .

the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ ecker believes to know how quickly a favorable living space can be created : it builds homes for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ den@@ burg , many refugees are pushing on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ hofer : the mass storage in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
because people stay in a big part here .
in view of the stream of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is different if you sub@@ vert the people in residential blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily re@@ built according to the specific needs .
how high is the cost ?
Gil@@ den@@ bach : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without plot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building instructions complicated their plans ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also hit by our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Internal Affairs Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
insp@@ ections at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum request will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and security of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , not the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously communic@@ ated the refugees arriving in direction to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances also Kor@@ ri@@ d@@ ore for the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar didn &apos;t look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ d@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external border of the Sch@@ engen Area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the minister stressed , Slovenia would not be able to abri@@ dged its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ sted , the first refugees had tried to pass in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media since then , Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly hit police vehicles with new refugees .
it is primarily about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country with about 4,000 refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , buses from pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted in direction to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Bel@@ grade , however , declared that it was the people to suggest specific routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with approximately 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d in the morning , in the course of the day other buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 miles away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary was made , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to go to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Sch@@ engen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need str@@ ingent insp@@ ections to quali@@ fy for membership in the Sch@@ engen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners face a good testimony to the country since then , as concerns the standard of border controls .

the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm Wednesday evening at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he is holding debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there wouldn &apos;t be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there is also 20 years after the end of the Croatian border there is still no more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields .

Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch .
the lower view comes despite price increases , average 4.9 percent , and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for soil transport of heavy and large packages from November onwards .
the company said that it nevertheless expects that the result will be increased from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trading . &quot;
the plans for the holidays were announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS , which plans to adjust the same number as last year , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research said analysts predi@@ ct analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six of Z@@ acks ques@@ tioned analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a drop in the international priority shipment to st@@ agn@@ ate sales in its unit Express delivery .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in the last quarter , sales in soil transport increased by 29 per cent , but operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices while the result dropped because of higher labour costs in freight business .
in the Pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
on its most expected conference in the years Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spent two days around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the gui@@ del@@ ine .
upon them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story sitting room there is a wall picture of the United States .
the map is a remin@@ der that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double @-@ sided contract from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ Factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented incen@@ tive due to the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that they grow solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already careful fo@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - and it is just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economic assistant at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently survey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ist mi@@ tig@@ ates the blow by promise that another increase is far removed .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average estimates by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , they should go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a net interest rate would calm down financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed is negoti@@ ating .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary to increase the pro@@ position .
although the job creation was slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation constantly ran under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but financial markets all over the world sent to the end of last month after China de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average Unit declined by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors fear@@ ed that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would cause global growth .
the market has slightly recovered in this month , where the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the High End of May .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would attract the rein@@ s in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at UC@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically during their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Currency Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently not linked with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for an increase in interest in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its control interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognition of the growth in the USA , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts back .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market collapse of 2008 to the first place , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the young@@ est tur@@ mo@@ il did not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mand@@ ate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think that it should be expected .

Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition is during bre@@ ast@@ feeding .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydr@@ ates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to make mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ri@@ eder sports hall
the council at Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2,3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar system .
the plann@@ ings for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the Bern@@ ri@@ eder sports grounds are prec@@ eded by step by step : in the young@@ est meeting of the community , the elabor@@ ated construction contract has been lo@@ wered without major discussions .
previously , the committee had decided on an application for a legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion from the actual development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be constructed with a non @-@ wearing first and roof top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderful southern roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; again , the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation , which is required for energetic reasons , is defined differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation was not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Bern@@ ri@@ eder Common is generally more restri@@ ctive in liber@@ ating contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent cases , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .

the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of an apparent policy :
instead of assist@@ ing R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially opened up the attitude of the Hungarian government into the d@@ unge@@ on of National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from this policy are not only those Austrian who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oultry will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ te country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is invited and welcomed , is nothing else than another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the beginning of winter to produce decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .

in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15.000 of the Bund .

for easily over@@ weight diabe@@ tics , weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery will live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a lead article to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , obes@@ ity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ane Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have collected data that have been collected in a study since 2007 and comparing two types of obes@@ ity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments about equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ go a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes lack is completely and at 28 % partial .
in the medical @-@ treated group , the type of diabetes is only at one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , were found out .
the researchers also supervis@@ ed the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .

in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gl@@ yc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - not the mort@@ ality in five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot;

while the new study shows no survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ ity people who under@@ went obes@@ ity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient is with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a reverse is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not receive all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called on to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that in the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ dic@@ tive to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dal@@ ai Lama Germany and Austria endeav@@ ours to cope with the crisis , he empha@@ sized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing is decreased in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and revealed that the violent reaction of the United States took a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he set violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;

po@@ ison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low strongly alco@@ holic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age are reported , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teen@@ agers have supp@@ os@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es that are very promising for children .
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few sp@@ las@@ hes can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ icity department at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry past@@ ing dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought to the treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold given by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ win@@ dy Medical Center outside Atlanta .

doctors watched them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had stum@@ bled into the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alco@@ holic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ations and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
on alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contain a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
healthcare authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth class were planning to shed their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gem@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state of New York by exam@@ ining anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergi@@ c to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the promised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

de Bo@@ er , currently an ambass@@ ador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the power .

they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .

I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .

when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .

but he wants an international rep@@ orter to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .

Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled note to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; Sample Example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the lim@@ ous@@ al of his team and said that they were only concent@@ rating on their &quot; contact &quot; during Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team was confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring events when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our defen@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus and that has provided us the turn of the trend .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting soccer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he has played his game on Saturday evening with our Saturday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters posted a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not make a point of stress ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is primarily gear@@ ed towards the compact cars , which are currently being sold particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new appro@@ vals fell down by the Federal Office ( KBA ) on this segment alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced in this year between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new sky@@ scra@@ pers and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand in autumn with dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order to keep the volume model well sold , the new Astra also will not be much more expensive .
Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competit@@ or VW Golf in view that starts at 17 650 euros .

the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hesse further offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competit@@ or VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is first only five @-@ door .
the second variant will be followed in the spring of the Kombi , which is also shown at the IAA .
and what will be next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault announces the fourth generation of its Astra Grand Prix Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
at the beginning of the next year , it comes as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan brand wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti features its curved lines full into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with a capacity of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model with gasoline engines is offered , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s specifications with 170 Newton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Finance this year , according to the statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can create this , and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is coming to Germany will give you the following overview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments have fallen out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments they will also apply to refugees .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there has been a political change according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ban on refugees for the recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the compulsory duty of residence , asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .

until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
tests also show that work@@ places are most frequently communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ än@@ hardt from the Königs@@ weg to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has established that only a few isolated parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the design of parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ yu , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the Administration notes are distributed in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialized schools .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without German knowledge in the welcome classes on the lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers who only have a qualification in German as a secondary language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no short@@ age of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Be@@ ate St@@ owe from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohib@@ its asylum seek@@ ers or im@@ pover@@ ished the study - the only exception was Berlin , inside ens@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned his position .
students will@@ ingly could facilitate access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ dung receive no services according to asylum seek@@ er performance law if they begin a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of the legitimate people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have had to live four years in Germany for four years in order to be eligible to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1st January 2016 , this Spanish span is short@@ ened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this financing gap must also be closed , calling Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program .
in future , Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the state should succ@@ umb to Islam succ@@ es@@ sively the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law continue to evol@@ ve into a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who professionally car@@ es for the new arri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and willing to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also the read@@ iness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zi@@ ek , commented on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to discharge such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be much more in future than today a topic of all society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , reducing discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European choices - for a decade a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NSU murder series showed systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German have long been demanding for a long time , and why international agreements like anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention in Germany must become reality in the coming years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical services to the previously expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says doctor &apos;s president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month they had laid it out and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25@@ ,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and services business activities .
the expected job cuts proceeds to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chair@@ person and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone enterprise , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ sur@@ passed , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as an explanation of the company .
it is a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to produce electro @-@ plants and their Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the bir@@ th@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV ) 2009 - 2010 Small@@ ville ( TV ) als Regisseur Originaltitel : Small@@ ville ( TV )
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain at the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had greatly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not end@@ anger the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not he@@ aled .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from pure medical view , but as Wen@@ ger also accepted , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister Ltd has 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he played in just 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight games since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from a violation , you have a vulner@@ ability period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deser@@ ves .
Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League Season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation inside the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and the players who need to take a little break break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al clear favourites are passed on by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
it is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsen@@ al hasn &apos;t worked in ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .

the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ als among young men prove to prove at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ dom ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a mis@@ er@@ able life ) is announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms demonstrated that when the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .

in the age of communication carried out on social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , fun and successful to appear , even though the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all on cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply .
and how a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire explained recently , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work but through his personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Joey and Chand@@ ler frequently frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football gu@@ cken in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross after Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can relate to each case even if they are often staying back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a co @-@ workers of phone pastoral care , I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and threatened with suicide , has really clearly demonstrated how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you are openly talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .

di Maria meet to help PSG , Malm@@ ö to m@@ alt
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helping to move to Malm@@ ö in his debut in the Champions League .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course , as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main took his Champions League Season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ ts as PSG player , who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head football in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , Paris is also required a strong start to the Swedish Masters , because they are not only aiming for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ l@@ aps but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later in the game against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and to look back , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regre@@ t that we didn &apos;t even have one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team that was held on the weekend 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on their own spot against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was impressed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine wing r@@ ash was called the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he suggested that when he went in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he went to Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that there would be a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which sm@@ ote the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle of the middle .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , there were even some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who had no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he had much more skill to put his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria into a shot that was di@@ stra@@ cted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er sc@@ ored his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to keep David Lu@@ iz , before the substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized by the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PSG was playing a class over his team , and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a great game from them !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 dollars or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sand@@ ing over Min@@ nes@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly mer@@ ry for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they were one of the best teams at bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing at the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) 06.11.2015 &#124; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Twin@@ s spent a chance to climb within a half @-@ half of the Houston Ast@@ ros game for the second American League wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vict@@ ories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held its early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two inner meetings , then once in the sixth and then again at the nin@@ th .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ring and made three races possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen of every game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely into the game .
the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate @-@ design@@ ate Victor Martin@@ ez had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first round in mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit hit of Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has weak@@ ened the be@@ ak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aus@@ mus said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( rehear@@ sal training ) , looked much better out of the bul@@ l@@ pen and he brought it directly into the game .
at the end of the seventh inner meeting , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to return to the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hardy .
Hardy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ design@@ ator Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run plan .
with a pair of runners and the end run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
in the Major League , it was the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play .
after Detroit , at the end of the nin@@ th of the nin@@ th inner of the nin@@ th inner ring , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit has benef@@ ited from the start of the game from an even non @-@ mo@@ vable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three rein@@ s in the first two inner attacks against the right @-@ wing veter@@ an who had been cancelled in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing because of a sp@@ inal cord more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez created his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right hand , creating another run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game as he attempted to get to the third , which ended the threat .

in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park was bapti@@ zed on the Opp@@ io hill on the name of the German reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now known as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Re@@ formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , Pastor of the Protest@@ ant Luther@@ an Church in Rome , remembered that Protest@@ ants were often able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority often only in the secret of their faith .

hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) bush is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ah@@ ost has written the introduction and updated bi@@ blical texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal interpret@@ ations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but what is by no means syn@@ on@@ ymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years Ot@@ mar has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has hit a subjective artistic choice from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cycles that focus on topics such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or f@@ ather@@ land are created .

and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has disper@@ sed on painting with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tures by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current connections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded between the original bi@@ blical quot@@ ation of Martin Luther and each one set by the artist who here formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry band has gold letters .
in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old makes double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the up@@ bringing happened to the tube , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up trying to bring myself back with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped today by rec@@ l@@ ame , and that is no@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure where you are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
artists have another desire and joy to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; influence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewers into the pictures , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how to compre@@ hend with his paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old did not desp@@ ise the Bible completely , but also cho@@ oses the most important , also mysterious themes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s about the pictures , the text just explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture Bible has been created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ hler , both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and also the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama turns everyone , no one must take away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football federal li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we need to use our radiation power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hertha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach signed the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements have started their own projects , be great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the Association will jointly introduce the DF@@ B selection and the federal government for 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as a fashion @-@ niche
in the past it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops were created in great numbers for customers , for example blan@@ k@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ zz@@ it@@ ze Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip fashion , fashion has played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is called a few examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , bor@@ row@@ ed on past stit@@ ches , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry is no longer on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ dena Pl@@ auen is member of the branch of Pl@@ auen and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .

our products do not reach the customer in this way .
today in the Asian room , mass ware is produced much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed by chains .
it also weak@@ ens exports , currently in Russia and the United States .
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by STIC@@ K@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a stress field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .

now she uses the snow tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener lace - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also delivers the US , Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and want to have a souven@@ ir .
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambass@@ ador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener lace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; XI ur@@ ges to open the economy broad for the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was appointed by the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be used to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new spin @-@ offs to promote and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vit@@ ality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Xi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group adop@@ ts a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ate market access , relaxation of border controls politics , promotion of state @-@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants @-@ milking system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created , identifying the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it indicates the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarant@@ e@@ eing a right @-@ state business environment and is open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also provide controls on the powers that are transferred to the company and ensure that companies will decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , foreigners are made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilitate the application process .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU wants to double mer@@ cury border value in pre@@ dator fish &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to demand a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; are to be raised from one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are still so strong with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the existing limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the threads are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be poli@@ te .
in return for this release , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kilogra@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Food@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low that they keep the planned high@@ s already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Stri@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , primarily in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low quantities of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very low quantities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage in terms of the maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants will run more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thir@@ ds of the total amount of mer@@ cury in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in f@@ ishes around river Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Perman@@ ent and comprehensive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been c@@ ited out of paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recent years of mer@@ cury in fish already counted among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
