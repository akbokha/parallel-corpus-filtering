Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of international agreement and Teh@@ eran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
in the meeting , however , it should also be the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the deal of the deal to the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deteri@@ orate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly as an affair against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of the election in Israel .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no indication that Lamb , who travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school site , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Lynn Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police were wounded .
a day after the shooting at the university , students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
from the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they rejo@@ iced in his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in one of his written book in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both subordin@@ ated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose curriculum includes 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations of proble@@ matic behavi@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ avers , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he seemed too excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something with him wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb had asked before the Delta State University to have a ple@@ asing for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
in this year , he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked as hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE , he said nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that they knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .

and some wait for a breakdown .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one claims that Tr@@ ump will likely win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts empha@@ size that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over to the ascending order Herman Cain , which was not only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bush@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps &apos;s stam@@ ina and start to run their dollars to over@@ throw it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :

the same number is considered in the first pres@@ elected state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent , that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament does not pas@@ se into the White House , so ABC / Post .

at this time in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination over only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .

even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still almost everybody .
some experts suggest that the frag@@ ile field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps Gui@@ delines while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University beginning of September shows that in a hypothe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is supporting majority support .
he has 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Paul , John Ka@@ det and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .

the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP .
the disp@@ uted private sc@@ atter@@ ing equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to much more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström &quot; &quot; &quot;

the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see that EU states and the United States have jointly selected independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and the third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would allow it to rise against jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ unde des Prime Minister
since its election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will debut at the Fra@@ gest@@ unde of the Prime Minister with Voltage Un@@ expected
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the launch of the Prime Minister and put himself on the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will lift up the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , with his performance by the media probably and the Labour ME@@ Ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , for it comes after his appointment to the member of the sh@@ aker and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour president &apos;s decision was prov@@ oked on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony commem@@ or@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ne has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he told the Labour leader to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; ir@@ respective of his faith that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party was originally supported as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements to the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that Labour changes lay down to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Mr Smith said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has since he has T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour President , who promised another policy approach , says he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Icel@@ an@@ dic North MP said that the question@@ n@@ aires of the prime minister is confront@@ atively , and that he has op@@ ted both &quot; impact &quot; and the stri@@ fe with contradictions , and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of the host minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ tha , the spokes@@ man of the Lower House to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s movement .
since it was first sent in the television in 1990 , the government was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the sub @-@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA Fili@@ alen in front of an Al@@ di @-@ Auf@@ marsch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ alers of Met@@ cash has launched a campaign campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker Sim@@ mo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA shops , and shop owner , selling tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food@@ stu@@ ffs , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investment strategy .
it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA network in the East States .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di 12 months after the opening of its first markets will take away some five per cent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deser@@ ves a praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; geri@@ et by the so@@ ber discussion of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with Stan W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a fier@@ y qualification game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rator : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have to beat him , and I should beat the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while he was last seen as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f was accused of a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am pretty jeal@@ ous is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ b in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fro@@ st with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe he was a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on he has never had a problem with the other players , he is hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it to be judged according to his own service .
He@@ aly also supported the decision that gi@@ os will not take into account the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , not on all the contex@@ ts round around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has done very quickly the as@@ cen@@ sion , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he climb@@ s up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some simple mistakes and deser@@ ves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to make him the consequences of his action . some time outside the ra@@ mp light , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .

Hungary declar@@ es the emergency and ri@@ dden the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that trying to get illegal to the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos was followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and left there .
but fru@@ strations climb@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helic@@ opter fle@@ w over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some referred to protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must take place in the coming days conversations with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ nations block with a strict meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who were transferred to Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary , however , did not set its hopes for a balanced action of Brussels or by its neighb@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could escal@@ ate roads and to speed asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence in the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison interest in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in recent months , Hungary has become a huge bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck in the Middle East to a considerable bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entrance to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came in force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , which is expected to be expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people in trying to cross the border , 15 others were already entering deeper into the country .
they come up by damage the fence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of criminal off@@ ences to the new laws .
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train wagon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders .
chaos converted the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and push a crowd to push it down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about 20 years it was possible to enter , but thousands stayed outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connections between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .

consent to dealing with the problems and the elect@@ ability are also c@@ ited .
since the vice president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the balance shell , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want him to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; but this number is dropped by 78 percent over the last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristics in vot@@ ers of the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion from S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons are used to use a personal email address and a server during the term as a foreign minister , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ings loaded
almost two years after a student while a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder charges are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police reported .

the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood were not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ full and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ sils began to hide and set the benefit of the Brotherhood in principle by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ zeich@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not revi@@ ve him , and he died in the next morning on his wounds .
after a Autop@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a interest rate is coming , and the Haus@@ se will come into the wake of debt , and the economy will gli@@ de into a rec@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what we know .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will stop .
this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015
a rec@@ ession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank empha@@ sized that investors should not concentrate on it when it starts to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for norm@@ alisation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at low level to lead to the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that seem to be afraid .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a view of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , interest rates can make things for a while volati@@ le .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are apparently a tendency that assets amounts to 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest rates of the f@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the er@@ tification cycle and the return on the return to decrease .
rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not be spe@@ eded up before and which could accelerate a rec@@ ession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in the interest increase of the f@@ ed .

interest increases in a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question whether it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the poli@@ shing cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing imp@@ etus at BI@@ P and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ oring very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to this , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds the ren@@ ders seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done .
at the end of the review cycle , the bond thick@@ nesses fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer and shorter arri@@ vals and lead to a breakdown of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stri@@ ving monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve has increased , and the volati@@ lity is increased - all features of the market if the F@@ ed intensi@@ fied its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that wrap up the larger part of their business activities in the USA are benef@@ iting when interest rates are rising and local products are becoming more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts are worse d@@ ast@@ ly , since an increasing dollar makes its products more expensive in the global market and likewise the financing of their deb@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively , three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet companies have a weak balance sheet according to each of the interest rates 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives of Parliament , Andrew B@@ ingham , said also the BBC Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also worked on the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards announced last year , The Br@@ its seem to be under another name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously called examples in which you actually only mim@@ ics what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , that I will not learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works in order , I also think it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controllers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work was to engage the audience when it did this in the past because the British had less than classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , that during the hearing in the Committee for the choice of culture , media and sport for the selection of culture , media and sports under fire , to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Collins handle The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for the estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George did as a judge - &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would like to find out that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit from our own farm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time star@@ ed a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further ranks of The Voice in the future or give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .

hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were gathered by the streets to bury the victims who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee .
as the first of the dead , the last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance C@@ emetery , was filled with mour@@ ning filled , largely in white .
the proc@@ ession went on to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the ending .

the def@@ endants are not guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them was indi@@ cted for minist@@ ration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this accus@@ ation has been released in May in May . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process was tag@@ t .
according to the Attor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused was cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose for private purposes in 2006 until 2011 .

the sports function@@ aries are also indi@@ cted because of financial transactions .
this F@@ akt@@ um was out of the chair of the chair , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the un@@ fai@@ th@@ fully laid down the defense that the association was not an asset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports function@@ aries had only reck@@ oned only allow@@ ances and the sports club , for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 , had invested in the deb@@ ts - the Pas@@ si@@ va concrete in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us continue or block the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ based financial account@@ ant of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put money to put our life insurance as a security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in collecting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , it may only be made of deb@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of financial and financial success , the payout of allow@@ ances was revers@@ ed until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the conversion compensation is only years later , as an increase in the account has been paid to the account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two def@@ endants charged the two def@@ endants together , the second def@@ endant said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal of the association has not been revealed in detail &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the details of the financial debt , it is important to only have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account in 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I mean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the co @-@ accused has been informed , the function@@ ally justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first def@@ endants declared that he was not agreed with this form@@ ulation because the club never had a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Di@@ et , he charged 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years were not able to point out the def@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are after an audit in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer have been kept , declared them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double fra@@ cture
Luke Shaw suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , a double fra@@ cture of his right piece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injury was caused by a retro@@ spective attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Shaw was built in the PSV area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has a double leg fra@@ cture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing cabin , he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double question@@ naire , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of a mis@@ ery .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rator had wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very difficult attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now begins , I &apos;m coming back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the UK def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive to recover from France to the coming of June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PSV @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very simple injury . &quot;
if a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break , as Mexico was played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very simple violation , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so that it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided to mention his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , as it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , met her desire to see a true tree , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was dead and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as if that &apos;s not yet a susp@@ icious enough , the text reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the converted city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although he is able to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little . here is an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the money gre@@ edy , trees , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , schn@@ ur@@ r@@ sty nature , &quot; that says in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax had not read twenty times one child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still difficult
on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeti@@ tion of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown amount of test level , an option for the attack .
in this case , Adam Ly@@ th fails to be replaced by Alex H@@ ales from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ players are aligned on results .
there was no question mark at Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I &apos;ve said that - players are their best sel@@ ections .

the Great Britain @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss pra@@ ised his post@@ ure , even though he did not have such good performance , and that surprised me not ; he is mainly a team man .
the question , how much time a test stroke is given to set his character is difficult .

only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise is that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a dr@@ ummer , which I restri@@ ct .
he is a X Factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as they get before him but this depends naturally from the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
I don &apos;t see why a dr@@ ummer can &apos;t beat there , and this Link@@ sh@@ änder has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s Devil of Cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team mate Justin Long played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has made three hundred races &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and did not look back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up wr@@ inkl@@ es , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pl@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few clever additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the testing games could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket Contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind to the changing cabin , even if the messages are consistent with the previously seen .
Coll@@ y team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , Root received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have a problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ mates do not determine the schedule .
and you need to think that the players depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy to heart .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ acy , recently said that some member states are deeply dist@@ ressed in various crises as the EU is now and not always from its own gu@@ ilt , Britain itself created an agenda with split conc@@ es@@ sions and distur@@ bing contract changes which they usually do not want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting that it would not like to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie @-@ Agenda .

it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us look through that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they are no matter whether we remain or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but it has been in power since 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as it looks bad for them , as with the exagger@@ ated long periods such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a verb@@ al force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poland has probably soon become a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to imagine that they are going to tear down a leg to help the sel@@ fie @-@ British that should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ sts have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally plan very helpful remarks , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new negoti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the new negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .

in fact , Mili@@ band more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ aner than Blair himself , as he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened it with a rear door .

it can take , but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;m really kind of - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional bl@@ am@@ ber tendency and the wild bra@@ ins of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism , everyone can say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Battle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on the Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is always the curved bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity for EU membership - in accordance with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under left discourse , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .

experts cri@@ tici@@ ze the report by Public Health England about E @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts from the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et to cri@@ tici@@ ze the methods used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have asked the loading capacity of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which PH@@ E founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at University of Liver@@ pool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received by British American Tobacco ( B@@ AT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of B@@ AT for Public Health in a Sustainable Annual Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants told the meeting to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the financing which he should have received by Philip Morris International according to reports from the Tobacco Company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which include some industries funding in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
the tobacco management of PH@@ E also took part in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; McK@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director for health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acted beforehand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers dies on his su@@ cht .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes in comparison are low , but that we continue to study long @-@ term implications .
PH@@ E has the unique duty to inform the public about what the evidence is occupied and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ .000 people die annually on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence .

the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said , the BBC should stop to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they will probably be seen from a smaller audience , which probably seems to be seen from a smaller audience , to place the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in his time with Channel 4 without success with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned , or sends them clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , what I think medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least give your production at least on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to see how this is supposed to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s to blame for reviews , &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they are not able to measure their tasks , and they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justi@@ fication 4 billion Swiss radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for people who is a lot of money for 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called that the BBC should check their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to inform , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to enter@@ tain and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be noted in the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada .
for the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with the commercial sen@@ ders alli@@ ances to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have b@@ red wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they have high frequencies for the human hearing to high frequencies to be heard .
the impul@@ ses work through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth of brain stimulation , a inv@@ asive procedure that ab@@ uses electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found it out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ as@@ ound waves affect structures which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the dice cells .
the sound waves provide the opening of these icons and activate the cells that are assigned to them so a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als are wearing .
when using ultr@@ as@@ ound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ bl@@ ouses and transfer into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be revealed to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound waves may occur freely and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student residence
eleven years ago , I went to a student residence in a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lang@@ at@@ ly complaints about others .
the most I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in the student housing ranges from slightly anno@@ ying up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you come if and where you have taken the sab@@ bat@@ age where you &apos;re standing in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly told Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in the serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - job questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were ri@@ pped in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people draw and their under@@ wear .
this is related to : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtain a rough treatment at the University .
your room should be a Refu@@ gi@@ um , but many student resi@@ den@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ room Bum@@ mel culture , which can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want that our friendship continues , but you must go away so that I have spent the energy that I have spent for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhau@@ sted - and send it a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
post : re : please honor best postings / Lob für Member postings
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by B@@ aking .
since you start the university on the cli@@ max of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people , to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ nies , is less stran@@ gely than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked it . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade le@@ ak@@ age is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ate are committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat , cause people to sleep when you anchor .
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student housing .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea ?
check that with the owner of the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that balanced as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you shouldn &apos;t make any noise , people from sleep or work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to man who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighb@@ ors if they do something , Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neigh@@ bours for two hours before she sle@@ pt her own music and buried her door and beg@@ ged her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would be random@@ ly drawn into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be deeply embar@@ rass@@ ed if you keep a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouse , they ran@@ ged to separate themselves and then experience them every day and perhaps have to experience how they bring all common friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes through its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse is , try at least to talk to your sub@@ li@@ b a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in its non @-@ closed room , the border between an Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is f@@ ading than it seems .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for men remain in a great part here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is different when people under@@ go people in living blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each living unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge area .
it may be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ ead : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without plot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are on our south border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provision and security of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor of the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refused &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously informed , even Slovenia wanted to continue to travel towards Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances , Kor@@ ri@@ d@@ ore will also be able to build Kor@@ ri@@ d@@ ore for the refugees .
this is how the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar looked up in Lai@@ bach , however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of Cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will be intensi@@ fying the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external border of the Sch@@ engen Area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian will not be able to abri@@ dged its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member needs to fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had tried to submit the first refugees in the night hours on Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the near ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles meet with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily for Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with some 4000 refugees said , Interior Minister Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian Border , which previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , were led to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Bel@@ grade , however , is that it is to propose the people to suggest certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can do it , nor do we want to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , there was a first bus with some 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day other buses are expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occup@@ ants were the whole night from around 500 kilometres away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has added , so the police said we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to go to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it could indeed be fores@@ een by ob@@ servers already fores@@ ee@@ able displac@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .

Slovenia is part of this since 2007 , the EU partners present a good witness to the country since then , which concerns the standard of border controls .
after the Hungarian border fence around 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ grade media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing between Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .

the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he &apos;s kept the debates about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high refugee pay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .

however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are recorded through Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian War , there is still no more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields .
on Wednesday morning the Croatian police reported that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

the company said that it is nonetheless expected that the result compared to the previous year due to cost reductions , higher revenues and the growth in online trading will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go far away in their explanation , in order to calm the financial markets so that they do not get into panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the pro@@ position .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market in this year was solid .

wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the end of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world sent to the end of last month after China had replaced its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cause global growth .
the market has slightly recovered in this month , and the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the end of May .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when events on financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would draw the rein@@ s in this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at UC@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US emergency bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he says that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is one of the main causes of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the then Lei@@ der Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cut its monetary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are not associated with the economic foundations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , entered into an interest rate , quoted in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought about 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognition effects on growth in the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts backward .
the F@@ ed should only set aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market collapse of 2008 to the first place , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Interest in the Bank of England .
the young@@ est turbul@@ ence did not come close to this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act contains still the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should be expected .

Brazil Pon@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to clari@@ fy women about how important good nutrition is during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding period .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydr@@ ates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to make mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ri@@ eder Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the Bern@@ ried community approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the plann@@ ings for the long @-@ lon@@ ged gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the Bern@@ ri@@ eder sports grounds are stepp@@ ing step forward : in the recent common meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction contract has been lo@@ wered without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had decided to have a request for a structural legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is supposed to be constructed with non @-@ sided first and roof over@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; thus we get a wonderful big south @-@ roof together , &quot; Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger explained in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is in turn around the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation , which is prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof tends not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ri@@ eder Shar@@ eholders are usually more restri@@ ctive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a decision regarding the Supervisory Board , and the day on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .

Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been managing director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , has been replaced by a private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spreading of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for the purpose of this transformation , no one wanted to express himself .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reach a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has also strengthened its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get 20,000 migrants in the country , but still in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor passed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gest@@ ar@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly there were ten people with travel c@@ aff@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany was surprisingly set off on Sunday because of the refugee bus with Austria , it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the near Pass@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before we have the un@@ expect@@ edly guests only once cooked , with snack and drinks .
we have said , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler at O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t take it to commit a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded ZU@@ G@@ PAS@@ SA@@ GI@@ ERE was rising on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE to a regional train towards Pass@@ au , at the short notice that the rail transport was set to Germany , but still to try out the border .
the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge firmly established with the Bavarian neigh@@ bours on Sunday , on Sunday before a branch run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further Z@@ ig@@ tens to us , is a logical result of a apparent policy :
instead of being in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in establishing structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially declared the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st Circle of National Soci@@ alism .
this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the border areas with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the p@@ oultry will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ ed land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers in the face of the ongoing refugee currents and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ fixed quartz
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugee parties .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ ustom@@ ed that his word is weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has deployed the former mighty Raiff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to set the districts for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of refugees arriving on Monday to Austria was without great vort@@ ex , Konrad and pra@@ ised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad was reck@@ oned with a demand of 85@@ .000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ge@@ ful year .
in order to fulfil the number , in the next few weeks , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the con@@ federation .
should it be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad , Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have been saved to him , even for the coming refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father immig@@ rated and opened a local pub for gold mines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foundation stone of the property group was first land@@ ed sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from the logic : her desire to return to the homeland , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged .
he had not recorded Tr@@ ump because he was once hom@@ eless without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for History and Folk , Roland Paul , declared the Film@@ start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the desc@@ endants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was repeated several times over the Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter@@ rent illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some train@@ ers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a rod as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ge at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in changing rooms after the game .
instead of his R@@ ook@@ ies from the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne openly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the Special Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to forget his promised catch and take care of the next game .

four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police abandoned rub@@ ber@@ cu@@ ffs into a crowd that were demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , a Beam@@ ter said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ h@@ ak@@ al , leading District officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of you war@@ n stones and fire bombs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ h@@ ak@@ al said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and poured into the air before laying on rubber tires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber compounds used , of which is known that they may kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced a so high death rate .
the discussion was the last two weeks of violent protests in Nepal in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces , which would be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce its political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties have signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been central for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way , but the legisl@@ ature acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature approved this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitution of Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easy over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery will live longer than those who are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , obes@@ ity operations have proven effective to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out with people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ane Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital has collected data that have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach sc@@ uba training - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BM@@ I remained at those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ went surgery with a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes illness dis@@ solved completely and partially in 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes is completely dis@@ solved only by one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
researchers also monitored blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .

while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was associated with obes@@ ity people who were subjected to a obes@@ ity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conven@@ tionally methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said , it is so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes that have met their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

the Dal@@ ai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be set before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is worth admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Dal@@ ai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in addressing the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly by education for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dal@@ ai Lama said the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US took a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after 11 September I expressed my pity in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange juice that are very promising for children .
Ham@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 % alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ ers can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison emergency centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let swal@@ low whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ ers from after straw@@ berry fragrance dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was brought into an emergency .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which applies in an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ win@@ nice Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
doctors supervis@@ ed them overnight in a separate children hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey told Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very anxi@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alco@@ holic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant cloth@@ s to store and store hands @-@ on dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of ham@@ des@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that had a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product was contained in meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was not@@ ated as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York are planning to forget their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gem@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergi@@ c to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and made them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the alleged plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ ih@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and proved discipl@@ arian measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles
in case of an accident on the cross @-@ sp@@ ange between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and On Her@@ ding , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been viol@@ ently injured .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck drove on the cross@@ roads towards the round@@ about industrial area and took too late , that at the round@@ about , two expected cars had stopped .
in the result he pr@@ all@@ ed his truck into the rear of a Audi@@ s and whether this vehicle was at a front of the Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the case of accident @-@ related vehicles , damage caused by about 10,000 euros , the police inform@@ s the police .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ ed Nieder@@ länder - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans are interested in Celtic , there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ence with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambass@@ ador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show high points of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here speak not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old Firm Play , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .

after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , who now faces five points ahead at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly as - but we need to continue .
we really need , really the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better .
now it is so important .

he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was held for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see Hin@@ ks in the USA , and there are often more applications available as places available , a ma@@ kab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .

I like the guy .
we laugh often much if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to give up my ignor@@ ance .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er as he wants , and you get access .
I agree with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they thought they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have been better form@@ ulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they still think it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he does not tell me what I write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international rep@@ orter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of movement against the death penalty will help .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables past year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he opposed the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , last stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what best for the race sport and he has found himself under difficult conditions than it went to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up@@ pers of Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had returned 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like too high @-@ handed grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to say nothing to say , and I have been eating for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything is coming out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to go to the main part , and I want my owners think that I am trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more train@@ ers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , Moo@@ dy saw the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before eigh@@ teen months Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I am asking - and offered him a employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they believe that I am a fraud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed to write me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to see what &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the R@@ V@@ L act on fei@@ ge and do people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not bad for the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so bad for the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license to me , and I don &apos;t have any doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .

Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ finished master Black C@@ aviar , called the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which was opposed to the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has irrit@@ ated mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been the whole day yesterday , which was also so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who imagine these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy propos@@ es to fight against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has cri@@ tici@@ zed criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high season victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are concent@@ rating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team were confident that they were worried that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this appears again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ struggles when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defen@@ sive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and that &apos;s the trend turn for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not willing to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds him that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has played his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball@@ game you want to play when you have this kind of players .

the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points of tension ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase .

it is also reflected in the IAA ( public stage 17th to 27th of September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new upper class and luxury cars this year , many new compact models are presented in this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand in autumn with dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
in order that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel presents an introduction below the biggest competit@@ or VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior in Germany , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again , we can create this , and we can create this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political change in Germany according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : the ban for refugees for recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dency of asylum seek@@ ers .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , there is no stri@@ c@@ ter offer of general and professional language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies show that work@@ places are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore according to the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt der Königs@@ weg for employment integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only few whis@@ pered parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ fax , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to convince the family to convince the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators strongly increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for instance by per@@ mitting more specialized schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared to prepare students without knowledge of German language skills .
but they are not always taught by educated teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ amps from the Berlin school administration .
the German student &apos;s work estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , there is no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or memory of studies - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CDU ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees could be easier to access to the higher education institution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ dung do not receive services after asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they start a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , because it does not fall under the circle of the legitimate people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this Span@@ ne is short@@ ened to 15 months .

the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the State should succ@@ umb to the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches law continue to develop a new state religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also belong to the rights .
in this way , the representative of Islam must be on clear contact persons and willing to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also the willingness to take heed against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
integration will be much more than today a topic of all society today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of European choices , Germany has a anti @-@ discrimination organisation and a general equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU murder series showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white German are demanding long and why international agreements as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention in Germany must become reality if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens will be able to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical attention to previously expected refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to take away people from their everyday str@@ ass and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to different animal protection organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our animals are not good , it &apos;s not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read by the eyes of every desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel good , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first command@@ ment : good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on her zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family is proud .

a Cul@@ inary Tour through the Alp@@ s. read on Biwak # 17 : wild Food
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down by a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the Falls was quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s opening of the parliament was sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zed by the statements made by ME@@ Ps of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with b@@ hr@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last month they had been bu@@ zz@@ ing him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politicians received SMS messages on their phones they warned to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it war@@ ns the Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokes@@ man said that Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i managed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers of politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard will be disman@@ tled up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard is expected to disman@@ tle 25@@ ,000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will divide into two listed companies in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and services business activities .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as an explanation of the company .
there is a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to produce electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto garage one called &quot; the bir@@ th@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring in order to overcome the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the newest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies bring a better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the final Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
this optim@@ istic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer on the European Championship is still un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of injury does not end@@ anger the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not he@@ aled .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from pure medical perspective , but as a Wen@@ ger also accepted , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister confirms 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ s in the last five play times .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs who have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a Teufel@@ sk@@ rei@@ ses , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that improvement in the injury rate is ongoing during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from a violation , you have a fold time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win fight force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deser@@ ves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger produces a press within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to take a little break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are passed through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the greatest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
it is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ reaching hope , with its management to lead the association to its first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has never worked at Arsen@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Comedy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even des@@ perate than ever has become ever before , such as self @-@ mor@@ ality among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in the effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ects ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of putting the culture into question , the men are hin@@ dered to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms revealed that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the age of communication carried out by social media , with its focus on style about substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , li@@ fel@@ ess and successful to appear , even though in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the dominant , which psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and how a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire explained recently , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work but through his personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football gu@@ cken in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross for Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a staff of the phone pastoral care , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my list@@ eners for people who feel de@@ pressed and suicide , really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you openly speak about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term wat@@ ering mechanisms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status about the phone calls people in moments of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the new back@@ drop for the celebration of the day , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

di Maria meets to help PSG to break Malm@@ ö
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps jumping to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course , as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main his Champions League Season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as a PSG player who brought the French Master to the way , but after that they had reached a number of opportunities before they finally raised their lead as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only strive for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quar@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs before the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ et@@ own team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ hill in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to create our opponents issues and have to look back , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regre@@ t@@ ted it was not yet one or two more goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to Paris team after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team that could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing dr@@ ummer was referred to as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he ran into the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed to why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he joined Johan Wil@@ and passed beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that he would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , the PSG itself was sometimes on , with some mis@@ mis@@ hes and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who had no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the rest@@ art .
nevertheless , he had much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which Di Maria was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from short@@ est distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to stop the final result before the waiting list E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that he played a class about his team , and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then we have played only in the Swedish League which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat ab vor Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Detroit Tig@@ ers after Min@@ nes@@ ota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Twin@@ s turned a chance to climb up within a half @-@ half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game of wild card .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters of F @-@ word , which was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vict@@ ories do fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support than Detroit three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once again in the sixth and then again in the nin@@ th .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) took 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game .
the Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Martin@@ ez had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first ever since mid @-@ August .
it was the first tri@@ er hit game from Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the Twin@@ s had their best chance to return to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the In@@ ning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks finished a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he replaced Bla@@ ine Hardy by the Link@@ sh@@ änder Bla@@ ine Hardy .
Hardy over@@ ran wall , the only man with which he was confronted with the R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the R@@ ook@@ ie Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the end Run at the second , Ver@@ hagen spent the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double Play .
it was that in the Major League leading the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a Double Play
after Detroit at the end of the nin@@ th Inn@@ ings he added an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit also benef@@ ited from the start of the game from a still not mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inner ings against the right @-@ wing veter@@ an who had been d@@ row@@ ned before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing because of a sp@@ inal cord more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am living when I started rele@@ asing and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches as in the third in@@ ning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez brought Victor Martin@@ ez to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez created his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right side , creating another run , but Victor Martin@@ ez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third that ended the threat .

and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the Bible by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded between the original Bible and the artist of Martin Luther and each one of the artist who has form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry band has golden let@@ ter@@ ers .
in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the education was already with the pipe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work that , in order to bear me again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to help art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by rec@@ l@@ ame , and it is no@@ isy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displac@@ ed .
artists have another desire and joy to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to leave the viewer into the pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them look at it , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how to compre@@ hend with his paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old did not desp@@ ise the Bible , but also chosen for him as important , also mysterious subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s about the pictures , the text is explained only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; &quot; &quot; already at this weekend , the 36 professionals set up a clear sign when they will take the pressure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make sure that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Leverk@@ usen Sport@@ manager Rudi Vö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

that all 36 license agreements have been launched in their own projects , be great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government , the German Federal Government will be at the disposal of 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called off the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Germany is trying to implement an international level that the allow@@ able maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 hours of hour will be lifted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government also wants to use a change in the Vienna Convention that only sees people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on high@@ ways to 2020 is technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , passenger cars must be expected in public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger exterior of the West@@ Lower Saxony University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to meet the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile design Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ alizes the historical snow circuit .
in doing so , the machine hits small kit@@ es at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ße was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow@@ ball point for their jewelry .
in a complex procedure , they pre@@ dest@@ ined the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ auen and its surroundings and want to have a souven@@ ir .
so I see my jewellery as a modern mess@@ enger of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open wide to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned by the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be able to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business green@@ ery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central management group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new green@@ ery to promote and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vit@@ ality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems .
according to the statement , a negative list is created which identi@@ fies sectors and companies that do not come into question .
the system is based on and tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it indicates the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legally recognised business environment and open the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen checks on the powers imposed on the companies and ensure that companies decide how they carry out their business .
the statement said that China border areas are allowed to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and bring better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and the consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significantly higher dose of nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organization Food@@ watch , which is a corresponding employer paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects failed in industrial and environmental policy are passed with full force to pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison@@ ing for large f@@ ishes at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kilogra@@ m of fish .
however , big pre@@ dat@@ ors are so strongly stressed with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the current limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the drums can not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ sured .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values in other fish at currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kilogra@@ m .
Food@@ watch recorded this but as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they keep the peak values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ eu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wolf sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mer@@ cury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal , which is strongly enrich@@ ing over the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities particularly in the damage of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry reports on its homepage in terms of the applicable maximum values , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mer@@ cury enters the environment above all through coal combustion .
according to a written information of the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock ordered more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thir@@ ds of the total population in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fishing around Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and extensive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been c@@ ited in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings before mer@@ cury in fish already counted among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
