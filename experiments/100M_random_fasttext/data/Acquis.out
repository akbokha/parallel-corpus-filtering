&quot; C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ open@@ ings , the system or the process phase , in which it is produced , or will be introduced in a later phase of the core @-@ flamm@@ able core material in the States , so it is subject to the other in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures are concluded in this Convention for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 , however , the community is not permitted in Article 11 , but the community is subject to the re@@ generation of core materials , the securing measures according to this Convention , which is not possible or des@@ irable , thus con@@ sul@@ ate the organization and the community to each other over the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;

&quot; on the searching of the community fre@@ es the organization of core materials that would otherwise be subject to securing measures for this agreement , if the whole , due to this article in the States liber@@ ated nuclear material at no time than any time . &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material that consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;

&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ UNG - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program on the conference for international economic co @-@ operation , to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , their development by general resi@@ li@@ ence problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States , that the whole of the Member States has been bound to force the agreement within six months after in@@ force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after in@@ force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organisation have con@@ sul@@ ated each other over the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced ge@@ ographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .

C ) Any member state can afford payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the administrative procedure takes about propor@@ tion@@ ate scre@@ enings on the cash or the scho@@ oner to cover the expenses for the special editorial loans and to compens@@ ate the special action account in appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the warranty of this loan , the administr@@ ators can lead to the following factors : &quot;
III ) to the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit capacity to loan terms without a guarantee ; and

capital ref@@ unds take place on the special action account and the amount paid on this way in the currency of a member state will be returned to the respective member state as soon as possible .
the administr@@ ators are instruc@@ ted to complete the E@@ EC via the directors of the directors in preparation and the directors of the directors of the directors and programs .
&quot; during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the E@@ EC is quar@@ terly quar@@ terly on the development of the special transactions and the expendi@@ tures for this purpose . &quot;
the administrative officer transmitted by E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organisation a detailed statement of the special action account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation to this account .

the applied manufacturing method must ensure that the final product described below the conditions described below and no in@@ oc@@ ul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis .
&quot; in addition , the production method must ensure that the si@@ RNA contained in the starting product is concentrated in sufficient quantity . &quot;
&quot; the method is satis@@ factory for every final preparation in this regard , when in the initial and final product si@@ RNA for at least one virus and a bacterial toxic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; during the production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ i@@ ost@@ atic substance can be put to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and stability of the final product , can be added to him an appropriate preser@@ v@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ sation agent . &quot;
the final product is delivered as a solution whose immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine concentration between 100 and 170 g per litre .
&quot; II ) The electro@@ phor@@ esis , by free floating particles and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the protein mass is the flexibility of the gam@@ ma@@ component of the normal human plasma . &quot;
&quot; the end solution may not have to be seen before or after a 7@@ day heating on 37 C visible signs of a breakdown or exercise . furthermore , it is advis@@ able . &quot;
tests with the method of cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging in the Ultra@@ cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in order to determine where mass the product is dis@@ mant@@ led with a lower molecular weight .
the pH value of the end solution must be dil@@ uted to a protein concentration of 10 g per litre with a solution that contains 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l pot@@ assi@@ um chlori@@ de per litre with a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.8 ± 0.4 .
&quot; the solution from human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin is in ster@@ ile , closed container under exclusion of micro@@ organisms ; it is protected from light to protect and maintain at a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; there may be further specific human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , unless an international standard is present , they are according to this standard , and their efficiency is in international units . &quot;
the human anti @-@ po@@ ison immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin has at least 500 international units of po@@ ison anti@@ bodies per ml which are determined by a neutr@@ alisation test on Ch@@ orio @-@ all@@ an@@ to@@ i@@ des membrane or on a tissue culture .

&quot; in other words , the specific human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine have been introduced in Section 4 &quot; normal human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; depending on the anti@@ body content , the immune system can fluctu@@ ate between 100 and 170 g per litre per litre . &quot;

&quot; dry reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ expensive gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container that they have been dried and so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ vit@@ re@@ tion may lose a maximum of 0.5 % of its weight if it is caused by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d in a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ ag@@ ence ( or the solvent of the solvent ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or anti@@ biotic , unless the re@@ ag@@ ence with the added substance continues to increase the conditions of speci@@ fic@@ ity and eff@@ icacy . &quot;

&quot; for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin exclusively contain human origin , or that animal or plant reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each box is a black and white printed label in English and French , which contains the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
