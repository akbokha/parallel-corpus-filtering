&quot; C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ open@@ ings , the system or the process phase , in which it is produced , or will be introduced in a later phase of the core @-@ flamm@@ able core material in the States , so it is subject to the other in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures are concluded in this Convention for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 , however , the community is not permitted in Article 11 , but the community is subject to the re@@ generation of core materials , the securing measures according to this Convention , which is not possible or des@@ irable , thus con@@ sul@@ ate the organization and the community to each other over the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;

&quot; on the searching of the community fre@@ es the organization of core materials that would otherwise be subject to securing measures for this agreement , if the whole , due to this article in the States liber@@ ated nuclear material at no time than any time . &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material that consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;

&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ UNG - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program on the conference for international economic co @-@ operation , to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , their development by general resi@@ li@@ ence problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States , that the whole of the Member States has been bound to force the agreement within six months after in@@ force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after in@@ force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The E@@ EC and the organisation have con@@ sul@@ ated each other over the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced ge@@ ographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .

C ) Any member state can afford payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the administrative procedure takes about propor@@ tion@@ ate scre@@ enings on the cash or the scho@@ oner to cover the expenses for the special editorial loans and to compens@@ ate the special action account in appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the warranty of this loan , the administr@@ ators can lead to the following factors : &quot;
III ) to the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit capacity to loan terms without a guarantee ; and

capital ref@@ unds take place on the special action account and the amount paid on this way in the currency of a member state will be returned to the respective member state as soon as possible .
the administr@@ ators are instruc@@ ted to complete the E@@ EC via the directors of the directors in preparation and the directors of the directors of the directors and programs .
&quot; during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the E@@ EC is quar@@ terly quar@@ terly on the development of the special transactions and the expendi@@ tures for this purpose . &quot;
the administrative officer transmitted by E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organisation a detailed statement of the special action account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation to this account .

&quot; the reag@@ ents used for blood @-@ group @-@ specific reag@@ ents can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools for strengthening the effectiveness and preservation of the stability of the re@@ generation . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin exclusively contain human origin , or that animal or plant reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; each box is a black and white printed label in English and French , which contains the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
